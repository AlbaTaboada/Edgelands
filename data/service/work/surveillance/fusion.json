They moved her to a secret site, commonly known as a black jail. The children discovered at the airport that they could not leave China, even though the police had said they were not being investigated or charged with a crime, the children told American officials and family associates.\nBy holding the family hostage, they said, the police are trying to force the siblings\u2019 father to return to China to face criminal charges. The father, Liu Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, is accused of being a central player in a $1.4 billion fraud case.\nThe children say their father severed ties with the family in 2012, but the Chinese authorities have still held them for months under a practice known as an exit ban \u2014 a growing tactic that has become the latest flash point in the increasingly rancorous relationship between the United States and China.\nSenior American diplomats, already contending with tensions over trade and territorial disputes, have denounced the way China uses exit bans as coercive, opaque and a violation of rights. In January, the State Department issued a travel warning, saying the practice posed risks to foreigners in China. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized the bans during a visit to China, and this month he mentioned the Liu family to a top Chinese foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, at a meeting in Washington.\nThe siblings have pleaded their case to American officials, including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser. \u201cThe investigative officers have made abundantly clear that neither my brother nor I am under any form of investigation,\u201d Ms. Liu, 27, wrote to Mr. Bolton in an August letter obtained by The New York Times. \u201cWe are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar.\u201d\nShe made similar points in an email sent in recent days to a family associate, saying that \u201cthe Chinese authorities have been consistent that neither Victor nor I are accused of or suspected of any criminal activity,\u201d and that the authorities have repeatedly said that \u201cthe reason we are here is exclusively to lure\u201d their father.\nOn Friday, in response to questions from The Times, a State Department spokesman, Robert Palladino, said the United States would continue expressing concern about exit bans \u201cuntil we see a transparent and fair process.\u201d\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry defended the holding of the three family members, saying: \u201cThe people you mentioned all own legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens. Because they are suspected of economic crimes, they are restricted from exiting the country by the Chinese police in accordance with the law.\u201d\nThis account of the Liu family\u2019s plight is based on interviews with administration and congressional officials, university employees and family associates, as well as correspondence by the children to them and public records. There are currently a handful of exit-ban cases involving Americans, but this is the first one in which those with knowledge of it are making the details public.\nIt is also a rare instance in which one of those being held \u2014 Mr. Liu, 19 \u2014 was born in the United States. More often, China imposes exit bans, which can last from days to years, on naturalized foreign citizens who were born in China. Security officers often treat them as if they were still Chinese citizens, even though China does not recognize dual nationality.\nThe law in China states that its nationals automatically lose their citizenship when they gain citizenship in another country. It also says that someone like Mr. Liu who is born with citizenship from another nation is not a Chinese citizen, no matter the parents\u2019 citizenship.\nThe Liu family members all entered China on American passports, and the State Department is providing them with citizen services. The police from Guangzhou, the southern provincial capital where the father worked, have taken Ms. Han, 51, to a hotel several times to meet with an American consular officer.\nLiu Changming, 53, the father, is among China\u2019s most-wanted fugitives, accused of helping to carry out one of the country\u2019s biggest bank frauds, in which $1.4 billion in illegal loans was issued to property developers. He fled the country in 2007.\nIn recent years, as the Chinese authorities have waged a fierce crackdown on corruption, they have increasingly viewed family members of corrupt officials as being tied to the illegal acts, with the police sometimes aiming to prosecute spouses.\nThe Liu family has lived with notable wealth in the United States, in part by acquiring real estate, though there is no indication from public records that the properties were purchased with the money that the father is accused of embezzling.\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Edward J. Markey and Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrats from Massachusetts, where the mother lives, have urged the United States government to act.\n\u201cOur office is aware of Victor\u2019s, Cynthia\u2019s and Sandra\u2019s situations and is deeply concerned,\u201d Mr. Markey\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to secure their safe return and continue to be in touch with U.S. officials to ensure a positive outcome.\u201d\nPurgatory With the Police\nThe Liu children are trapped in a situation far from their elite American lives. Both attended Groton, an expensive Massachusetts boarding school. Ms. Liu graduated from Stanford and Harvard Business School. The family has a $2.3 million house in a Boston suburb, and the mother, a businesswoman, controls or has her name on companies with real estate holdings worth at least $10 million, including two luxury apartments in Manhattan, according to public records.\nSince June, the children have tried to leave China three times. They travel between cities, staying in hotels or with an uncle. Their ailing grandfather died in October. They limit their electronic communications because of suspected surveillance.\n\u201cOut of concern for the security of these young Americans, we will refrain from public comment as we continue our efforts to constructively and directly engage the Chinese government to allow them to return home,\u201d said David Pressman, a partner at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who is representing the Liu children.\nThe Georgetown president met with the children this month in Beijing. Harvard has written to the Chinese ambassador in Washington. McKinsey is in touch with Ms. Liu. People tracking the case say they hope President Trump will raise the issue at the Group of 20 summit meeting this week in Argentina, where he and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, are expected to meet.\nChina has convicted foreigners of crimes and even executed them. It has also detained Muslims who are foreign citizens in its northwest internment camp system. The exit bans are different \u2014 the authorities do not keep the people at a detention site or present a legal justification. They use the ban mainly as a means of coercion: to squeeze out information, to compel a relative or friend to return to China, or to force the victim to settle a business dispute.\nIn one case, an American stayed in China under an exit ban for more than two years. A continuing case involves a Singaporean national working for UBS, the Swiss bank, which has prompted UBS to issue travel warnings to its employees.\n\u201cMany police actions are now taken outside the legal system, and both Chinese citizens and foreigners, especially those who used to be Chinese citizens, have been kept in China with no apparent legal authority,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University.\nChina\u2019s increasing use of the practice is a result of major trends: a growing disregard for civil rights among Chinese security forces; a sweeping anti-corruption campaign started by Mr. Xi in 2012; and a rush among corrupt officials and executives to move overseas with their families. In 2014, China announced the start of a global campaign to hunt down fugitive former officials.\nMany of the former officials live overseas in luxury, with new names and citizenship. China has sent secret agents to the United States to try to retrieve some. China has also asked the United States to send back former officials, but the two countries do not have an extradition treaty.\nAmerican officials have been reluctant to cooperate because of China\u2019s human rights abuses and lack of rule of law, though there have been exceptions \u2014 including the repatriation of a former vice mayor accused of stealing $39 million.\nThe \u2018Naked Official\u2019\nIn 2007, Chinese auditors closed in on what was becoming the country\u2019s biggest bank fraud case. Liu Changming fled China that December, state media reported. The top official at the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of Communications, he was at the center of the case.\nOfficials charged him in 2008 with making illegal loans of about 9.8 billion yuan, or $1.4 billion, including some to a company he secretly controlled, according to Caixin, a financial newsmagazine. Officials convicted Mr. Liu\u2019s co-conspirators but recovered only half of the money.\nIn 2015, China put Mr. Liu on its \u201cSkynet\u201d list of 100 most-wanted fugitives. Interpol issued a \u201cred notice\u201d for his arrest. His whereabouts are unknown.\nThe Financial Times reported in 2009 that after escaping China, Mr. Liu took part in shareholder meetings in London for Canton Property Investment Ltd., a company whose Chinese subsidiaries received the illegal loans. The company had gone public in London in August 2007 and raised $50 million, but was delisted the next year.\nPublic records show that a person named Changming Liu is linked to a home in Chestnut Hill, Mass. The address matches the one Cynthia Liu lists on her Harvard alumni page. The home is owned by Sandra Han, the mother. Zillow, the real estate website, estimates its value at $2.3 million.\nA company controlled by Ms. Han bought the home in 2009. Several real estate companies, trusts and limited liability corporations are registered to that address, and they in turn own rental properties in Massachusetts and luxury apartments in New York.\nWhile Mr. Liu was moving up the ranks of China\u2019s banking bureaucracy, he became what the Chinese call a \u201cnaked official\u201d \u2014 someone who settles his family abroad, with relatively easy paths to foreign citizenship and well-regarded schools, and with the Chinese authorities an ocean away.\nThe mother and daughter moved to California in 1998, and by early the next year they lived in a condominium in Alhambra, a Los Angeles suburb popular with Chinese immigrants. In June 1999, Mr. Liu and his wife bought a three-bedroom home in nearby Arcadia. Records show they obtained Social Security numbers in California around this time.\nTheir son Victor was born in California that July. He later lived in southern Chinese cities for five years, leaving Guangzhou in 2007.\nThe couple sold the Arcadia home in 2004 and bought a house in a gated community in Armonk, N.Y., an affluent town, records show. The home was transferred to Cynthia Liu\u2019s name in 2011 and sold in 2014 for almost $900,000.\nMs. Han is a trustee of an entity called Bountiful Success Trust \u2014 2014, which bought a $2.77 million condominium in downtown Manhattan in 2016. Another company she controls owns a unit at the Lucida on the Upper East Side that Zillow values at $4.17 million.\nLike his mother and sister, Victor Liu is interested in business, and he rented a room this summer with Noor Darwish, his first-year roommate, in a Georgetown home to do an internship at his university\u2019s endowment office. But he left suddenly in June. He called Mr. Darwish as he was leaving the country.\n\u201cHe told me he had some family problems, and that his grandfather had had a heart attack,\u201d Mr. Darwish said.\nThe university has strongly pushed for the siblings\u2019 release. On his trip to China this month, the Georgetown president, John J. DeGioia, met with senior officials. With him was Evan S. Medeiros, a professor who had helped negotiate releases of American hostages in North Korea as senior Asia director in President Barack Obama\u2019s National Security Council.\nThe university has a little-known connection to China\u2019s leadership. A nephew of Mr. Xi, China\u2019s president, is a recent graduate of Georgetown\u2019s School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, he also interned at the Brookings Institution.\nNone of that has helped. With winter break looming, Mr. Liu\u2019s friends on campus are asking why he has been absent all semester. \u201cOur room is a lot lonelier now,\u201d Mr. Darwish said.\nIn China, Mr. Liu has been eating and sleeping poorly. His sister mentioned concerns about her own health in her letter to the White House. She wrote, \u201cWe feel alone, angry, and most of all afraid, and more than anything, we just want to come home.\u201d\nEdward Wong reported from Washington, and Michael Forsythe from New York.

I got lucky, but because of dysfunctional, discriminatory rules, most don\u2019t.\nWatch the video above by the rapper Meek Mill on the urgent need to reform the criminal justice system.\nI\u2019m blessed \u2014 I\u2019m busy recording an album and catching up with friends and fans as my family and I make plans to celebrate the holidays. It\u2019s a far cry from last year, when the season passed with me behind bars. I send my prayers to all those who are still in the web of the system: Please know you are not forgotten.\nLike many who are currently incarcerated, I was the victim of a miscarriage of justice \u2014 carried out by an untruthful officer, as determined by the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s office, and an unfair judge.\nMy crime? Popping a wheelie on a motorcycle in Manhattan. Even though the charge was dismissed in a New York City court, a Philadelphia-based judge still deemed my interaction with the police to be a technical violation of my probation \u2014 stemming from a 2007 arrest \u2014 and sentenced me to two to four years in prison despite the fact that I didn\u2019t commit a crime. The judge also refused my motion for bail, calling me a \u201cdanger to the community\u201d and a \u201cflight risk.\u201d\nThe ordeal cost me my most precious commodity: my freedom. I served five months. With the help of friends and the intervention of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, I was released on bail this past April and was able to resume my life.\nBut I know I\u2019m the exception to the rule \u2014 a lucky one. It\u2019s clearer than ever that a disproportionate number of men and women of color are treated unfairly by a broken criminal justice system. The system causes a vicious cycle, feeding upon itself \u2014 sons and daughters grow up with their parents in and out of prison, and then become far more likely to become tied up in the arrest-jail-probation cycle. This is bad for families and our society as a whole.\nWe, as a free and democratic society, must do better. Since my release, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to meet with several lawmakers such as Gov. Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, and I\u2019m determined to use my platform to help those without the resources to make their voices heard.\nWe all need to hold our lawmakers accountable for supporting unfair or inhumane policies and all practices that perpetuate injustice, especially for the blacks and Latinos who fall prey to them most frequently. The reality is African-Americans and Latinos who come from poverty-stricken neighborhoods are assigned public defenders too overburdened to do anything in most cases other than negotiate the most favorable plea deal, regardless of guilt or innocence.\nSoon, some friends and I will be announcing a foundation dedicated to achieving real change. In the meantime, if you\u2019re interested in joining us and lending your support to solving what is the moral crisis of our time, please visit www.reformnow.com and sign up.\nTogether, we will demand stronger prison rehabilitation programs, updated probation policies \u2014 including shortened probationary periods \u2014 an improved bail system and balanced sentencing structures.\nIt\u2019s a shame that model probationers can be immediately put back behind bars simply for missing curfew, testing positive for marijuana, failing to pay fines on time or, in some cases, not following protocol when changing addresses. Our lawmakers can and should do away with these \u201ctechnical violations.\u201d\nAnd more broadly, if they\u2019re serious about reducing mass incarceration and unnecessary government surveillance, they should introduce legislation that allows people on probation to earn a reduction in probation time for good behavior so that entire swaths of people aren\u2019t spending the majority of their adult lives on probation as I did.\nThe money saved from imprisoning fewer people could then be used for employment programs and mental health counseling that would equip the formerly incarcerated with the tools for reintegration into society.\nAbove all, we need to make sure punishments actually fit crimes. Mine certainly didn\u2019t. But I am choosing to see my situation in a different light, to see that I\u2019m incredibly fortunate. A higher power has put me in a position to help fix this \u2014 to help clean up this persistent stain on our society.\nMeek Mill (@MeekMill) is a multiplatinum hip-hop artist and an advocate of criminal justice reform.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/opinion/meek-mill-criminal-justice-reform.html", "tags": [{"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.27972"}, {"label": "courts", "score": "0.13778"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.07920"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.07790"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.07542"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.06160"}, {"label": "holidays and special occasions", "score": "0.05512"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.05264"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.04735"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.04048"}, {"label": "discrimination", "score": "0.03376"}, {"label": "judges", "score": "0.03214"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.02620"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.02547"}, {"label": "christmas", "score": "0.02511"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.02076"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02059"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.01804"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01769"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01680"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01507"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.01474"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.01234"}, {"label": "retail stores and trade", "score": "0.01124"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01071"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.00899"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.00864"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00837"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.00836"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.00760"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Philadelphia", "Manhattan", "New York City", "Philadelphia", "Pennsylvania"], "ORG": ["the Pennsylvania Supreme Court"], "PERSON": ["Meek Mill", "Meek Mill", "Tom Wolf", "Meek Mill"]}}, {"index": 2, "year": 2018, "title": "The Land That Failed to Fail", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/18/world/asia/china-rules.html", "text_content": "The West was sure the Chinese approach would not work. It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.\nIn the uncertain years after Mao\u2019s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West?\nIt was the autumn of 1984, and on the other side of the world, Ronald Reagan was promising \u201cmorning again in America.\u201d China, meanwhile, was just recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil. There had been progress in the countryside, but more than three-quarters of the population still lived in extreme poverty. The state decided where everyone worked, what every factory made and how much everything cost.\nThe students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy \u2014 and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it.\nLate one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy \u2014 and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. \u201cAs they were discussing the problem, I didn\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d recalled Xu Jing\u2019an, now 76 and retired. \u201cI was thinking, how do we make this work?\u201d\nThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation.\nChina now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.\nAn epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.\nThe pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations.\nDuring this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot.\nBut neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail.\nIn late September, the People\u2019s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride \u2014 a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world\u2019s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin.\nThe world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world \u2014 and the American understanding of how the world works.\nThere is no simple explanation for how China\u2019s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear \u2014 a sense of crisis among Mao\u2019s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nEven as they put the disasters of Mao\u2019s rule behind them, China\u2019s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace \u201creform\u201d to survive \u2014 but \u201creform\u201d must never include democratization.\nChina has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground.\nMany people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared.\nWhether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely.\nApparatchiks Into Capitalists\nNone of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out.\nMr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao\u2019s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a \u201ccadre school\u201d doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao\u2019s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China\u2019s first stock market in Shenzhen.\nAmong the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China\u2019s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them.\nMr. Wang headed China\u2019s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing\u2019s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party\u2019s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China\u2019s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party\u2019s leader.\nThe careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China\u2019s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists.\nBureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September.\n\u201cSanya,\u201d Mr. Yan said, referring to the southern resort town he leads, \u201cmust be a good butler, nanny, driver and cleaning person for businesses, and welcome investment from foreign companies.\u201d\nIt was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges.\nMikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch.\nAfraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it.\nParty leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach \u201ccrossing the river by feeling the stones\u201d \u2014 allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first.\n\u201cThere was resistance,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cSatisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.\u201d\nAmerican economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party\u2019s strategy \u201can open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.\u201d\nBut China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation\u2019s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao\u2019s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction.\nThat included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief \u201cstudy tours.\u201d When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them.\nAt the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system \u2014 the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined.\nIn cities like Shanghai, Chinese schoolchildren outperform peers around the world. For many parents, though, even that is not enough. Because of new wealth, a traditional emphasis on education as a path to social mobility and the state\u2019s hypercompetitive college entrance exam, most students also enroll in after-school tutoring programs \u2014 a market worth $125 billion, according to one study, or as much as half the government\u2019s annual military budget.\nAnother explanation for the party\u2019s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao\u2019s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant.\nThe party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets.\nThese seemingly minor adjustments had an outsize impact, injecting a dose of accountability \u2014 and competition \u2014 into the political system, said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \u201cChina created a unique hybrid,\u201d she said, \u201can autocracy with democratic characteristics.\u201d\nAs the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled.\nThe private sector now produces more than 60 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output, employs over 80 percent of workers in cities and towns, and generates 90 percent of new jobs, a senior official said in a speech last year. As often as not, the bureaucrats stay out of the way.\n\u201cI basically don\u2019t see them even once a year,\u201d said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. \u201cI\u2019m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?\u201d\nIn recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party\u2019s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access.\nIn doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy \u2014 that it can build and run \u201cnational champions\u201d capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington.\n\u2018Opening Up\u2019\nIn December, the Communist Party will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the \u201creform and opening up\u201d policies that transformed China. The triumphant propaganda has already begun, with Mr. Xi putting himself front and center, as if taking a victory lap for the nation.\nHe is the party\u2019s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng\u2019s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by \u201chostile foreign forces.\u201d\nIn other words, he appears to have less use for the \u201copening up\u201d part of Deng\u2019s slogan.\nOf the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world\u2019s factory. China\u2019s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations.\nThe party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as \u201cgrown out of the soil of China\u201d and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China\u2019s rise \u2014 that Beijing\u2019s former enemies helped make it possible.\nThe United States and Japan, both routinely vilified by party propagandists, became major trading partners and were important sources of aid, investment and expertise. The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988.\nMr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy.\nBut in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes.\nMr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike\u2019s largest Chinese supplier.\n\u201cChina\u2019s policies were tremendous,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.\u201d\nMr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China \u2014 and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland\u2019s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico.\nThe timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan\u2019s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy.\nBefore long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China.\nNow Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island\u2019s future is uncertain.\nThere are echoes of Taiwan\u2019s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment.\nThe remorse may be strongest in the United States, which brought China into the World Trade Organization, became China\u2019s largest customer and now accuses it of large-scale theft of technology \u2014 what one official called \u201cthe greatest transfer of wealth in history.\u201d\nMany in Washington predicted that trade would bring political change. It did, but not in China. \u201cOpening up\u201d ended up strengthening the party\u2019s hold on power rather than weakening it. The shock of China\u2019s rise as an export colossus, however, was felt in factory towns around the world.\nIn the United States, economists say at least two million jobs disappeared as a result, many in districts that ended up voting for President Trump.\nSelective Repression\nOver lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China\u2019s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.\n\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. \u201cOne day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.\u201d\nUntil the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s.\n\u201cAt the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.\u201d\nSuch has been the seesaw pattern of the party\u2019s success.\nThe pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao\u2019s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to \u201creform and opening up\u201d once more.\nMany who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation\u2019s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs.\nNow Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle?\nThe fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China\u2019s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe.\nThe party has always been vigilant about crushing potential threats \u2014 a fledgling opposition party, a popular spiritual movement, even a dissident writer awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But with some big exceptions, it has also generally retreated from people\u2019s personal lives and given them enough freedom to keep the economy growing.\nThe internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it.\nIn 2011, it confronted a crisis. After a high-speed train crash in eastern China, more than 30 million messages criticizing the party\u2019s handling of the fatal accident flooded social media \u2014 faster than censors could screen them.\nPanicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same.\nThe compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties \u2014 and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape.\n\u201cThe cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,\u201d said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. \u201cWe still get the information we need for economic progress.\u201d\nA \u2018New Era\u2019\nChina is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other.\nThe question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner.\nThe trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing\u2019s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached.\nThe two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades \u2014 and how it should do so now.\nMr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration\u2019s policies as proof of what they have always suspected \u2014 that America is determined to keep China down.\nAt the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party\u2019s formula for success may be faltering.\nProsperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough.\n\u201cThe basic problem is, who is growth for?\u201d said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved this problem.\u201d\nGrowth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population.\nMr. Xi himself has acknowledged that the party must adapt, declaring that the nation is entering a \u201cnew era\u201d requiring new methods. But his prescription has largely been a throwback to repression, including vast internment camps targeting Muslim ethnic minorities. \u201cOpening up\u201d has been replaced by an outward push, with huge loans that critics describe as predatory and other efforts to gain influence \u2014 or interfere \u2014 in the politics of other countries. At home, experimentation is out while political orthodoxy and discipline are in.\nIn effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture \u2014 and that to survive and surpass the United States it must.\nCertainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s America is in retreat while China\u2019s moment is just beginning.\nThen again, China has a way of defying expectations.\nPhilip P.

Then His Colleagues Were Hacked.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/world/americas/mexico-spyware-journalist.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nA Journalist Was Killed in Mexico. Then His Colleagues Were Hacked.\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The messages arrived at a familiar moment of crisis for Mexico\u2019s fragile journalist community \u2014 another reporter killed in the line of duty.\nJavier Valdez, a prominent investigative reporter, had been shot dead only a day earlier. Then came a sudden breakthrough: According to a text message received by his colleagues, his killers had been detained.\nDespite the tragedy, his co-workers were suspicious. More than 90 percent of murders go unsolved in Mexico. How did the authorities solve the case so soon?\nMore likely, they worried, the text messages were an attempt to infiltrate their smartphones \u2014 part of a pattern of hacking attempts involving sophisticated spying technology bought by the Mexican government.\nThey were right.\nThe messages were infected with a spyware known as Pegasus, which the Mexican government purchased from an Israeli cyber arms dealer called the NSO Group, according to a forensic analysis by the Citizen Lab at the Munk School at the University of Toronto.\nA simple click on the links embedded in the messages would have infected the cellphones with spyware powerful enough to break through encrypted messaging, monitor emails and remotely activate the camera and microphone.\nSomeone was trying to spy on Mr. Valdez\u2019s closest friends and colleagues the day after he was killed last year \u2014 most likely the Mexican government, according to those targeted.\n\u201cI believe they wanted to search our conversations and messages for clues to the murder of Javier, but we are absolutely against this,\u201d said Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez, the co-founder and news director of Rio Doce, the news organization where Mr. Valdez worked. \u201cNothing obtained illegally should be used in an investigation, and especially not from those who are involved professionally and emotionally to the victim.\u201d\nThe illegal use of the surveillance technology in Mexico first emerged during the administration of Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, which bought the spyware on the condition that it be used only to target terrorists and criminals.\nBut in the last year and a half, the Citizen Lab has confirmed nearly two dozen highly questionable targets, including some of Mexico\u2019s most prominent journalists, human rights lawyers and anticorruption activists.\nWhen news of the surveillance erupted last year, the Mexican government denounced the spying and opened a federal investigation into any misuse of the technology.\nBut the federal investigation has gone nowhere. Not a single individual has been punished for abusing the system.\nWell aware of the scandal, Mr. Boj\u00f3rquez said he had little faith in the messages he was receiving. He and another target \u2014 the news director, Andres Villareal \u2014 refused to click on the links. They had reason to be suspicious.\nThe men were running one of the few independent news groups in the nation, dedicated to covering organized crime and exposing the underbelly of Mexico\u2019s vast nexus of crime and corruption.\nTheir work made them few friends. Threats came with the territory, and not just from organized crime. Government data show that public officials are responsible for the greatest number of assaults and attacks on journalists.\nBut Mr. Valdez\u2019s work and international profile, they figured, protected him. He was known and beloved by local and foreign journalists alike, and was the recipient of awards and recognition globally.\nHis death and the subsequent targeting of newsroom leaders exposed two of the most devastating risks to the freedom of expression in Mexico today.\nOne is the physical threats to journalists and, by extension, freedom of speech in Mexico. More than 47 journalists have been killed since Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in late 2012, 15 of them after Mr. Valdez\u2019s death in May of last year, according to Article 19, a journalist protection group.\n\u201cWe believed that a journalist as prestigious as Javier was untouchable,\u201d Mr. Boj\u00f3rquez said.\n\u201cWhen they killed Javier, we understood from that point on that they could kill anyone,\u201d he added. \u201cWe understood that the paradigm had been broken.\u201d\nThe second risk is a separate but connected facet of the rule of law in Mexico: There is essentially near total impunity when it comes to how it is broken or applied \u2014 a dynamic underscored by the use of illegal spyware to intimidate and spy on pro-democracy voices.\nDating back to 2016, the target list has been a who\u2019s who of Mexico\u2019s most prominent voices aiming to bring accountability to the nation, including the directors at Rio Doce.\nMr. Boj\u00f3rquez said he and others had become aware of the government\u2019s potent spyware in February 2017, when the Citizen Lab and The New York Times published articles outlining its illicit use against backers of a nationwide soda tax.\nThe investigations detailed the purchase of the spyware by the Mexican government, and included details about its proper use. The Israeli company claimed it had sold the software only to governments, and said it had measures in place to ensure that its clients followed the ethical guidelines stipulated in purchasing agreements.\nMexico\u2019s government was deeply embarrassed by the scandal. And yet months after the attempted hacking of doctors and activists promoting a tax on sugary drinks in Mexico, which is suffering a diabetes crisis, the targeting did not stop.\n\u201cThese infection attempts are reckless, and probably indefensible,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, adding that the company had already been exposed for abuses previously. \u201cWhere was the internal oversight? And where was NSO\u2019s oversight?\u201d\n\u201cWe hold ourselves to a rigorous standard of ethics and regulatory compliance and take any accusation seriously, no matter the source,\u201d a spokesperson for NSO said. \u201cWe do not tolerate misuse of our products against civil rights activists, journalists or any innocent person. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract.\u201d\nMexico has become an emblem of problematic use of spyware. In a series of articles in 2017, The Times and the Citizen Lab detailed the extensive use of the malware against journalists, minors, human rights lawyers, politicians and anticorruption activists. It also included critics of the president.\nThe NSO Group claimed that it monitored abuses of its software and intervened to stop clients from targeting people who did not fall within the permitted categories.\nBut even after suspicious targeting was unveiled in February 2017, operators in Mexico continued their illicit spying.\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s tenure has been marked by scandals: the questionable purchase of a multimillion-dollar home by his wife from a favored government contractor; the unsolved disappearance of 43 students; and the widespread hacking of the nation\u2019s nascent pro-democracy movement. His six years in office has also seen an unusual rise in homicides.\nBy this summer, Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has governed for nearly a century with few interruptions, was practically broken. Across both houses of Congress and in the race for the presidency, it suffered devastating losses.\nIn response to the latest reports about the targeting of Mr. Valdez\u2019s colleagues in the aftermath of his murder, the government had little to say.\nGovernment officials did not comment on the specifics of the continuing investigation, but said that the government was open to collaborating with the victims and remains committed to pursuing any charges should evidence emerge.\nA new government comes into office in the next week, arriving on a wave of popular support. But whether the status of journalists will change in the country, and whether their targeting and abuse, and state overreach will subside, is an open question.\n\u201cA change in government does not mean there will be a change in the context of impunity or aggressions against journalists,\u201d Mr. Boj\u00f3rquez said. \u201cIf there is no change to the impunity, the murder of journalists will continue.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/world/americas/mexico-spyware-journalist.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.52361"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.22837"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.22348"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.18907"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.12970"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.10315"}, {"label": "cellular telephones", "score": "0.07913"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.05221"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.04927"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.03993"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.02982"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02840"}, {"label": "espionage", "score": "0.02525"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.02396"}, {"label": "assassinations and attempted assassinations", "score": "0.02376"}, {"label": "hoaxes", "score": "0.02231"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01720"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.01481"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.01408"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.01180"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.01159"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.01131"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.01095"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.01089"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.01024"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.00993"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00970"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.00948"}, {"label": "frauds and swindling", "score": "0.00937"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.00926"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Mexico", "MEXICO CITY", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico"], "ORG": ["Pegasus", "the NSO Group", "the Citizen Lab", "the Munk School", "the University of Toronto", "the Citizen Lab", "the Citizen Lab", "The New York Times", "Citizen Lab", "NSO", "NSO", "Times", "the Citizen Lab", "The NSO Group", "Institutional Revolutionary Party", "Congress"], "PERSON": ["Javier Valdez", "Valdez", "Javier", "Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez", "Rio Doce", "Valdez", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Boj\u00f3rquez", "Andres Villareal", "Valdez", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Valdez", "Javier", "Boj\u00f3rquez", "Javier", "Boj\u00f3rquez", "John Scott-Railton", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Valdez", "Boj\u00f3rquez"]}}, {"index": 4, "year": 2018, "title": "Covering a White House Where News Is Always Just a Tap Away", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/personaltech/covering-a-white-house-where-news-is-always-just-a-tap-away.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nTech We\u2019re Using\nCovering a White House Where News Is Always Just a Tap Away\nKatie Rogers\u2019s beat is full of real-time digital moments. One tip to keep on top of it: If you call insiders from a blocked number, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re the White House and answer.\nHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Katie Rogers, a White House reporter for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\nHow do President Trump and Melania Trump use tech?\nThey\u2019re an Apple couple. Both use their iPhones to interact with the outside world \u2014 sometimes to the chagrin of Mr. Trump\u2019s security advisers and critics.\nThe president is not as technologically savvy as the first lady. His aides slip him paper copies of news articles, and when he travels on Air Force One, an aide is often spotted carrying around these mysterious-looking cardboard boxes. They are full of paper documents. The president will often sift through the papers when he needs to refer to something \u2014 which can be where that famous Sharpie of his comes into play.\nMrs. Trump is more tech oriented. She uses Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, mainly on her phone. Like her husband, she is very interested in her coverage but also uses those tools to keep track of things she\u2019s interested in, including fashion design, magazines and astrology. (She\u2019s a Taurus and follows the @taurusismagic account on Twitter, which has an interesting bio.)\nShe keeps in touch with staff in person, but also through lots of email and texts. When planning events, she will do internet searches to find things she likes and then gives staff photos of what she wants, or draws things, with the Be Best logo being one example. She also uses email, text, phone calls and Signal to keep in touch with her contacts.\n(What a coincidence: I use Signal, too. Mrs. Trump, call me.)\nHow have you seen White House tech evolve under President Trump?\nI think moment-to-moment digital coverage of every single thing the president does is new with this White House. President Barack Obama had people tracking his movements through Twitter and beyond, but with this administration, journalists live-tweet, photograph and send video from pool sprays (brief Oval Office events) and Marine One departures, in addition to news conferences.\nIf I\u2019m on the road, it\u2019s easy for me to tune into a pool spray or speech through someone else\u2019s Periscope live-streaming account, for instance. And when the president is at one of his properties, including the Trump Hotel or Mar-a-Lago, I often lurk on Instagram to see who is hanging out with him.\nThe Trump White House also had journalists switch over to an in-house Wi-Fi network, which made some reporters understandably uncomfortable for security reasons. The West Wing has also made more use out of devices that scan for gadgets including phones \u2014 I can understand why Signal is so popular. I think the anxiety over surveillance is perhaps more heightened than it was under the Obama administration, which, by the way, did its part to pave the way for these types of procedures.\nWhat are your most important tech tools for keeping up with breaking news from the White House and talking to your sources?\nI\u2019ve been on this beat since January. I thought I was pretty much tethered to the news before, but this job requires you to imbibe a daily tidal wave of news. So that\u2019s fun.\nA lot of my monitoring is Twitter-based, so I use tools I\u2019ve relied on for years. I use Nuzzel, a social news app that lets me know what the people I follow on social media are sharing, which is helpful for identifying the stories getting traction. And I use Twitter\u2019s list function to sort all of the noise into manageable buckets: I have lists of White House reporters, politicians, White House aides and Washington chatterboxes.\nOutside of a few news apps, I dislike having notifications on my phone in general \u2014 my eyes tend to glaze over if I have too many \u2014 but I receive them from a few news organizations and whenever the president or his press secretary tweets. Several of my colleagues have the Apple Watch, which gives them a friendly little jolt when those tweets happen. I haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to cross that particular Pavlovian bridge yet.\nLiving and working in Washington have a way of narrowing your perception, so I try to make sure I understand what people outside my bubble are talking about and reading. On my computer, I use Tweetdeck \u2014 which helps manage Twitter accounts \u2014 to display a list of prominent conservatives, which runs alongside a list of journalists. It\u2019s interesting and instructive to see how the two worlds function in real time, especially when news hits.\nThis beat is competitive, and building it from scratch has meant using a lot of research tools \u2014 Nexis for phone numbers, Spokeo for social media accounts \u2014 and making a lot of cold calls and sending emails. (If I really need something, I\u2019ll go to your doorstep.) I\u2019ve also learned that calling from a blocked number leads people in the president\u2019s orbit to believe the call is coming from the White House, so they answer right away.\nI text or WhatsApp with my sources, and we often transition to Signal. With the caveat that nothing is perfectly secure, Signal encryption tends to provide peace of mind, especially since it comes with a function that allows messages to wipe out after a certain period. I have some sources who set their messages to dissolve after a few minutes, which has come in handy if they\u2019re sending documents.\nSpeaking of security, I use two-factor authentication on everything, and LastPass to save my passwords, because I\u2019m constantly forgetting what mine are.\nWhat could be better about some of these tools?\nThis is just a small thing, but you know how Snapchat will show you if someone screen-grabs your message? That would be interesting to have in Signal, but absolutely no one would use Signal if that function existed.\nAlso, Twitter can be a minefield of bad intentions and lost context. There is a performative aspect to being on that platform that I don\u2019t enjoy. So since 2016, I have used a service called TweetDelete, which gets rid of my tweets that are more than a week old. I was sort of wistful when I saw my entire Twitter history wiped out and delivered to me in a spreadsheet, but I have no regrets.\nOutside of work, what tech product do you and your family love?\nI wouldn\u2019t say my husband and I are particularly tech savvy. We still enjoy having good old-fashioned squabbles over the thermostat, so we don\u2019t have a smart home.\nAt home, I love having friends and loved ones over, so I use the NYT Cooking app to help find recipes to feed them. (I spent the fall perfecting an apple butter rugelach.) I love apps for travel, including Kayak, Hotel Tonight and Airbnb. And on my last vacation, which took me pretty far north, I downloaded Aurora Pro and Sky Guide to view the Perseid meteor shower.\nGiven the gig, I can have a hard time focusing or winding down, so I have been experimenting with meditation apps. I recently downloaded one called Happy Not Perfect. I used it at work the other day when I needed to focus on writing, and even though Maureen Dowd\u2019s assistant was in the background yelling about a moose that got hit by a fast-moving car, I turned back to my piece refreshed.\nWhat tech product is on your holiday wish list?\nUgh. Probably an Apple Watch.\nKatie Rogers is a White House correspondent in the Washington bureau, covering the cultural impact of the Trump administration on the nation's capital and beyond.

Bannon made a trip to the Connecticut country house of Henry A. Kissinger to talk about China.\nIt was more of a pilgrimage, actually: the prophet of disruption seeking out the high priest of geopolitics to make the case that Mr. Kissinger\u2019s view of America\u2019s relationship with China was hopelessly out of date. The two men talked for hours in the sunroom, and while they enjoyed each other\u2019s company, they did not, in the end, see eye to eye.\n\u201cHe agreed 100 percent with my analysis,\u201d Mr. Bannon recalled, \u201cbut he disagreed with my conclusions because they were too blunt force.\u201d\nMr. Kissinger confirmed this account, saying he told his visitor that the United States and China must strive for the \u201cpartial cooperation of countries that by normal standards might be considered enemies.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a different view,\u201d Mr. Kissinger added dryly.\nIn the four decades since the United States re-established diplomatic ties with China, Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Bannon can be seen as bookends.\nWith his secret trip to Beijing in 1971, Mr. Kissinger kicked off an era of engagement marked by the stubborn belief that bringing China out of its isolation through trade and investment would make America safer \u2014 and perhaps make China more like America. That era now seems to be ending, giving way to a more hostile one, with a trade war encouraged by Mr. Bannon and the ascendancy of his view that the United States must confront China while it still can.\nFrom the White House to the boardroom, from academia to the news media, American attitudes toward China have soured to an extent unseen since Mr. Kissinger\u2019s historic trip. China\u2019s rapid rise, and the acute sense of grievance and insecurity it has stirred in the United States, has led some to conclude, as the title of a recent book about the relationship suggested, that these two giants are \u201cdestined for war.\u201d\nThe United States and China, of course, have had their ups and downs ever since the 1780s, when New England brigs first sailed to China with beaver skins and silver coins, ushering in more than a century of exchanges that sent Christian missionaries to the Middle Kingdom and Chinese railroad workers to the Wild West.\nThe two nations fought as allies in World War II, then faced off as foes in the Cold War, before Richard M. Nixon rekindled relations with Beijing to isolate the Soviets. The hopes generated by Deng Xiaoping\u2019s economic opening in the 1980s were dashed by the Tiananmen Square massacre. The trade deals of the 1990s were strained when wayward American bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.\nFor at least a decade, Americans have blamed China for shuttered factories and jobless workers. Public views of China swung from positive to negative in 2012, according to Pew Global Research, and have remained underwater since. About 38 percent of Americans now view China favorably \u2014 down from 44 percent in 2017 \u2014 but that number is not markedly worse than it has been for the last half-decade.\nYet the current chill in the relationship seems different, less a temporary rupture than a searching reappraisal of what a status-quo superpower should do about an ambitious, formidable challenger.\nThe Trump administration has adopted a more confrontational stance but struggled to set clear goals and articulate a strategy for achieving them. To date, its efforts have been scattershot: trade tariffs that have rattled Beijing but also Wall Street, a foreign aid program dwarfed by China\u2019s enormous loans for infrastructure overseas, a warning against Chinese meddling in American elections without much evidence of such activity.\nThe White House is channeling antagonism that extends far beyond Washington. Business executives accuse China of stealing technology from their firms. College professors suspect that some of its exchange students are spies. Military officers see its warships advancing across the Pacific.\nMany Americans who embraced trade and cooperation with China had hoped that bringing it into the global economic order would, over time, pull its politics and society into a kind of convergence with the West. Yet China is heading in the opposite direction under the strongman rule of Xi Jinping, toward less political freedom and more state control of the economy \u2014 a surveillance state at home that nourishes imperial ambitions abroad. Far from modeling itself on the United States, China is presenting itself as a defiant alternative.\n\u201cIn our good-hearted way, we wanted to believe that with a few more cultural exchanges, a few more visiting ballet troupes, China would come around,\u201d said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cBut Xi Jinping shut the door on that. He said, \u2018Not only are we not going there, but we have our own model now.\u2019 \u201d\nKevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and longtime observer of China, said the political and economic changes in China under Mr. Xi, and in the United States under Mr. Trump, had shattered the consensus in both nations about how to manage the relationship. That, Mr. Rudd said, portended an uncertain \u2014 and almost certainly more dangerous \u2014 future.\n\u201cYou can almost hear the ripping sound somewhere up the middle of the Pacific,\u201d Mr. Rudd said in an interview, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s put back together.\u201d\n\u2018Tacit Allies\u2019\nRealpolitik motivated Mr. Kissinger\u2019s outreach to China: He and Nixon saw it as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. But they were not immune to what an American diplomat, U. Alexis Johnson, called \u201crapturous enchantment.\u201d After a return trip to Beijing in 1973 to open a liaison office, a euphoric Mr. Kissinger wrote to Nixon, \u201cWe have now become tacit allies.\u201d\nIn the United States, China suddenly became cool. \u201cAmericans donned Mao jackets and Mao hats, stir-fried in woks, and wielded chopsticks,\u201d the journalist John Pomfret wrote in his 2016 book, \u201cThe Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom.\u201d Shortly after Nixon\u2019s landmark trip, the Chinese cut a $392 million deal with a Texas company to build 16 fertilizer plants in China, an early sign of engagement\u2019s bottom-line benefits.\nDiplomatic relations would ebb and flow, buffeted by domestic politics in both nations. But trade across the Pacific began a relentless upward march. Companies like IBM, Citibank and Jeep were entranced by the vastness of the Chinese market, and the pioneers of engagement marveled at how quickly commerce came to define the relationship.\nEven a devastating setback, the deadly crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, did not snuff out those ties. President George Bush, who once headed the United States liaison office in Beijing, secretly sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing to keep the relationship from going off the rails.\nIn March 2000, after the United States opened the door to China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, Bill Clinton laid out the case for economic integration as the best way to bring freedom to the country. In one of the more forceful arguments for engagement made by an American president, he promised that W.T.O. membership would wean China off state-owned enterprises and open its society.\n\u201cThe more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people \u2014 their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when individuals have the power, not just to dream but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.\u201d\nMr. Clinton\u2019s view was widely shared at the time, and not without reason. Under President Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, the Communist Party withdrew from large parts of the economy, encouraged private entrepreneurship and welcomed foreign investors.\nOver the decades, the United States and China built the mightiest commercial relationship in history: Trade between the two ballooned from $5 billion in 1980 to $231 billion in 2004. China soon became the manufacturer of choice for T-shirts and toys, laptops and television sets. General Motors, Motorola and other American companies that invested in China made healthy profits. To satisfy the American appetite for low-cost goods, China began exporting more to Walmart alone than it did to most entire nations.\nBy 2006, though, China\u2019s transition to market economics was slowing, and it began pursuing a policy of \u201cindigenous innovation,\u201d establishing targets to achieve dominance in high-tech industries that were traditionally the domain of the United States and Japan. By the time Barack Obama was elected, a narrative had taken hold in some quarters that letting China into the W.T.O. was a mistake.\nMr. Obama called out Beijing on the theft of American technology and intellectual property, and needled two of his advisers, Lawrence H. Summers and Jeffrey A. Bader, about their work in negotiating with China during the Clinton administration. \u201cDid you guys give away too much?\u201d he asked, according to Mr. Bader.\nPresident Trump has since turned Mr. Obama\u2019s private gibe into a political slogan. Letting China into the W.T.O., he argues, was the original sin of America\u2019s dealings with China \u2014 a defective agreement that gave the Chinese license to steal from American companies and siphon off American jobs.\nBut to Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative who ran the negotiations with Beijing in the 1990s, whether China should have been admitted is a \u201cnonsensical question.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was going to end up in the W.T.O.,\u201d she said.\nWith a fifth of the world\u2019s population, nuclear weapons, a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council and a track record of economic opening, China could not realistically be kept out, she argued. It already had significant access to the world\u2019s major economies, including the United States. If it did not join the W.T.O., it would have continued to reap the benefits without being forced to open its own markets.\n\u201cThe issue is, was it going to be a substantively, commercially significant deal?\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said. \u201cAnd I would argue that the proof is in the pudding.\u201d China, she noted, now imports more goods from the world than any country besides the United States.\nBut with every step China took to open its markets, it erected new barriers that hobbled foreign competitors and favored its own companies. The problem was not China\u2019s W.T.O. membership but the failure of American officials to use the tools in the agreement to force China\u2019s compliance with the terms, Ms. Barshefsky said.\n\u201cThe U.S. did the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t continue to do the right thing.\u201d\n\u2018Economic Aggression\u2019\nPeter Navarro, the bomb-throwing economist who heads Mr. Trump\u2019s trade office, said he first noticed the corrosive impact China was having on the American economy in the early 2000s, when he was teaching evening classes at the University of California, Irvine.\nDuring the day, most of his students held down jobs. But Mr. Navarro recalled noticing that \u201cmy students were having more and more problems in the job market. It was a puzzle to me. I thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Navarro already suspected that jobs were moving to China because of its low labor costs. But after a year of research, he concluded there were four other factors at play: China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property, its subsidies for exporters, its currency manipulation and its dearth of environmental regulations.\n\u201cAll roads led to China,\u201d he said.\nThe economist remade himself into a China Cassandra, publishing books like \u201cThe Coming China Wars\u201d and \u201cDeath by China\u201d that put him on the radical fringe of his profession. But his views dovetailed with those of Mr. Trump, who had railed for decades against the unfair trade practices of China and, earlier, Japan.\nWhile the Japanese threat was overblown, there is little disagreement now that China contributed to the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Cheap Chinese clothing decimated textile jobs between 1973 and 2015. Chinese furniture makers wiped out their American counterparts. For blue-collar America, \u201cMade in China\u201d became synonymous with the ravages of globalization.\nNow ensconced in the White House, Mr. Navarro has supplied the intellectual grist for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. In June, his office published a report titled \u201cHow China\u2019s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World,\u201d which accused China of preying on American companies in a variety of ways.\nOther economists still dismiss Mr. Navarro\u2019s prescription, which consists of piling on more tariffs until China agrees to fundamental changes. But privately, many businesspeople share his diagnosis. Their immediate concern is Made in China 2025, a state policy that seeks to dominate key industries by forcing American companies to hand over technology and assisting Chinese firms with subsidies.\nOccasionally, American frustrations with Chinese partners and competitors spill into the open. In July 2010, the then-chief executive of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, said at a private dinner, \u201cI am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.\u201d General Electric backpedaled furiously after his comments were reported. Despite their grievances, American business executives were still afraid of antagonizing the Chinese authorities, who could order raids on their operations.\nDoing business in China became even harder after the financial crisis of 2008. By that time, China had passed Japan to become America\u2019s largest creditor, holding about $600 billion of United States Treasury notes. Chinese officials were appalled by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and fearful of their own exposure. If they were always suspicious of American politicians, now they turned against their friends on Wall Street, too, taking a harder line in negotiations and rejecting their calls to open up the Chinese economy further.\n\u201cChinese officials began to dress down Americans and skip meetings,\u201d said James McGregor, the chairman of greater China for APCO Worldwide, who advises companies dealing with Chinese officials. \u201cFor the Chinese leadership, this was the emperor-had-no-clothes moment.\u201d\nStrategic Competition\nFor all of Mr. Obama\u2019s wariness on trade, he was as committed to engaging China as each of his predecessors going back to Nixon. He sought global issues, like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation, on which the United States and China could work together. But his strategy, known as the \u201cAsia pivot,\u201d also called for a greater American diplomatic and military presence in the region, to try to manage China\u2019s rise.\nThe Trump administration has rejected the Obama strategy, branding it na\u00efve and inadequate. It has adopted a more combative approach, formally designating China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and \u201crevisionist power,\u201d one that is trying to rewrite the rules of the post-World War II order to match its own interests and ambitions. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides say that China has gotten away with too much for too long, and that only a show of American strength can force it to change its behavior.\nThe cornerstone of this policy has been the trade war, with new tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports in place and Mr. Trump threatening more. Yet the administration\u2019s objective is uncertain.\nMr. Trump has floated various demands that would be difficult to enforce or require a wholesale overhaul of the Chinese economy, including a sharp reduction in the trade deficit and an end to coercive technology transfers. Some trade and security hawks have urged \u201cdecoupling\u201d the United States entirely from the Chinese economy.\nThe Trump administration has taken a tougher approach outside trade as well. It has stepped up naval patrols in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where the Chinese have been turning isolated spits of reef into military installations. But it has not laid out how the United States can stop a Chinese military buildup that is already tilting the balance of power in the region in Beijing\u2019s favor.\nThe Trump administration has also taken a harder line on economic espionage, indicting Chinese citizens accused of being intelligence agents, tightening controls on Chinese investment, and even considering a plan to restrict Chinese students from attending American universities.\nLeft unanswered has been a profound question: How can the United States compete by closing its doors when openness has been key to its success?\nVice President Mike Pence laid out the case for confrontation in a harshly worded speech last month that many interpreted as a call for a new Cold War, with the United States as defender of democracy and market competition and China as the champion of authoritarianism and state-led growth. But as he called for a sustained effort to counter Beijing, Mr. Pence made little effort to reach beyond America\u2019s partisan divide and rally the entire nation behind it.\n\u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he said, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s leadership is working; and China wants a different American president.\u201d\nThe conflict with China is intensifying amid unresolved concerns about American leadership and overreach that built up during the era of globalization, and in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other distant battlefields.\nIf anything, Mr. Trump has shown a desire to pull back from commitments around the world \u2014 a pattern, critics say, that has sundered trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and undermined America\u2019s allies, depriving the United States of one of its greatest advantages in a geopolitical competition.\nChina\u2019s own efforts to win friends and expand its influence, meanwhile, have brought mixed results so far. As part of its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has dangled billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in dozens of countries, from Malaysia to Kenya. The Trump administration has condemned the loans as predatory and is trying to put together its own competing aid program.\nMr. Trump\u2019s instincts about China are not easy to pigeonhole. He speaks often about his friendship with Mr. Xi and admiringly of China\u2019s economic success. His grievances are rooted in trade \u2014 in the conviction that China has been cheating the United States \u2014 rather than in Beijing\u2019s ambitions in Asia or its repressive political system.\nAmong his advisers, there is a wide disparity in how they view the coming contest. Some, like Mr. Navarro, cast it as an epic struggle over who will control the commanding heights of the 21st-century economy. Others, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, have tried to put the brakes on Mr. Trump\u2019s most belligerent trade moves.\nThey feud constantly, and at times publicly, about who speaks for the president, leaving both Chinese officials and China experts in the United States confused about the direction of American policy.\nMr. Bannon, who says his views of China were formed as a young Navy officer in the Pacific in the 1970s, speaks in almost apocalyptic terms, foreseeing a clash of civilizations. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to be the Confucian, mercantilist model or the liberal democratic Western model handed down from Greece,\u201d he said.\nMatthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia on the National Security Council, portrays it as more of a traditional, Cold War-style rivalry between superpowers with competing ideologies. He began his career as a foreign correspondent in China, where a state security officer once roughed him up.\n\u201cWe in the Trump administration have updated our China policy to bring the concept of competition to the forefront,\u201d Mr. Pottinger said recently at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s O.K. For us, in the United States, competition is not a four-letter word.\u201d\nThe trouble is, there has been very little public debate about any of this. What are the goals of America\u2019s competition with China: toppling the Communist regime or thwarting China\u2019s rise, as some in China have long suspected, or merely trying to modify its behavior? And in any case, how much are Americans willing to sacrifice for it?\nGraham Allison, a Harvard professor who worked in the Defense Department to reshape relations with former Soviet nations after the end of the last Cold War, argues that a rising power like China is likely to come to blows with an established one like the United States. In his book \u201cDestined for War,\u201d he describes a chilling scenario in which an accidental naval collision in the South China Sea escalates calamitously into a full-blown conflict.\nBut some China experts note that other areas of dispute, like Taiwan, have not become more fraught in recent years. And whatever the issue, they argue, a disastrous miscalculation is more likely without persistent engagement.\n\u201cAmericans need to understand that if we go down the road of disengagement from China in pursuit of unbridled competition, it will not be a repetition of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\u201d said Mr. Bader, the former Obama adviser. \u201cThe rest of the world, like us, is deeply entangled with China.\u201d\nAs a result, he said, even countries as wary of China as the United States \u201cwill not risk economic ties nor join in a perverse struggle to re-erect the \u2018Bamboo Curtain,\u2019 this time by the West. We will be on our own.\u201d\nAt 95, Mr. Kissinger, not surprisingly, takes the long view. Together, he said, the United States and China exert such power, and are capable of inflicting such unthinkable destruction, that they owe it to the world to find a path toward \u201cpartial cooperation.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to make the effort of moving in that direction,\u201d he said.\nHarking back to his session with Mr. Bannon, Mr. Kissinger added, \u201cI cannot guarantee that that will be the result.\u201d\nMark Landler, a White House correspondent, was The Times\u2019s Hong Kong bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He was the last American journalist to ask a question of President Xi Jinping, during his news conference with President Barack Obama in the Great Hall of the People in 2014.\nDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anha", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/25/world/asia/china-us-confrontation.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "international relations", "score": "0.33971"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.33680"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.26874"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.26112"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.07602"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.03779"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03379"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.02838"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02661"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.02615"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01947"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01919"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01899"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.01626"}, {"label": "china-international relations-us", "score": "0.01592"}, {"label": "christians and christianity", "score": "0.01464"}, {"label": "nytravel", "score": "0.01119"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.01066"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.00687"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.00674"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00636"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.00601"}, {"label": "corporations", "score": "0.00578"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00481"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.00474"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.00457"}, {"label": "oil (petroleum) and gasoline", "score": "0.00443"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00442"}, {"label": "prices (fares, fees and rates)", "score": "0.00429"}, {"label": "mergers, acquisitions and divestitures", "score": "0.00416"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["U.S.", "China", "Connecticut", "China", "America", "China", "the United States", "China", "the United States", "China", "Beijing", "China", "America", "China", "America", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "The United States", "China", "China", "the Middle Kingdom", "Beijing", "Belgrade", "China", "China", "China", "Beijing", "China", "Washington", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "China", "Australia", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "the Soviet Union", "Beijing", "the United States", "China", "the Middle Kingdom", "Texas", "China", "United States", "Beijing", "Beijing", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "Japan", "China", "Beijing", "China", "China", "America", "China", "United States", "Beijing", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "U.S.", "China", "Irvine", "China", "China", "China", "China", "China", "Japan", "China", "America", "China", "China", "China", "China", "China", "China", "China", "Japan", "America", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "the United States", "Beijing", "the United States", "the United States", "China", "Beijing", "America", "China", "China", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "Syria", "America", "the United States", "China", "Beijing", "Malaysia", "Kenya", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "Beijing", "China", "the United States", "China", "Greece", "China", "China", "Washington", "the United States", "America", "China", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "Taiwan", "China", "the Soviet Union", "China", "China", "the United States", "the United States", "China", "Hong Kong"], "ORG": ["the White House", "the Chinese Embassy", "Pew Global Research", "The White House", "the Center on U.S.-China Relations", "the Asia Society", "IBM", "Citibank", "Jeep", "the World Trade Organization", "W.T.O.", "the Communist Party", "General Motors", "Motorola", "Walmart", "W.T.O.", "W.T.O.", "W.T.O.", "the United Nations Security Council", "W.T.O.", "W.T.O.", "the University of California", "the White House", "General Electric", "General Electric", "United States Treasury", "Lehman Brothers", "APCO Worldwide", "the Trans-Pacific Partnership", "Belt and Road Initiative", "Treasury", "Commerce", "the National Economic Council", "Navy", "the National Security Council", "the Chinese Embassy", "Harvard", "the Defense Department", "White House", "Times"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Stephen K.

Sadat!\" tens of thousands of Cairenes chanted at the grinning figure in the open limousine. ''Sadat! The man of peace!'' It was the night of Nov. 21, 1977. President\nAnwar el-Sadat had just returned from his epochal journey to Jerusalem. Egypt's people were giving their frenzied approval to what his trip had achieved - an Egyptian-Israeli thaw that set the\nstage for the peace treaty of 1979.\nWhat made Mr. Sadat into such a catalytic force in Middle Eastern history was a display of courage and flexibility that transformed what had seemed to be an average Arab officer-turned-potentate.\nUnlike so many of his brother Arab leaders, he was willing to ignore past Arab-Israeli hatreds. Unlike them all, he was daring enough to do what had been unthinkable in the anguished world of Arab politics\n- to extend the hand of peace to the Israeli foe. Reversing Egypt's longstanding policy, he proclaimed his willingness to accept Israel's existence as a sovereign state.\nAdmiration and Hatred\nThen, where so many Middle East negotiators had failed, he succeeded, along with Presidents Carter and Reagan and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, in keeping the improbable rapprochement alive.\nIn the process he earned himself, in addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, the admiration of Americans, Israelis and other supporters of a Middle East settlement. But he also drew outpourings of hatred\nfrom Palestinians and other Arabs who felt he was a traitor to their struggles against Israel. And he was unable to quash dissidence in his impoverished, seething homeland.\nHe often said he wanted to bequeath democratic institutions to his people, but in recent weeks he staged a dictatorial crackdown on militant Moslems and Coptic Christians as well as secular political\nopponents. And he claimed imperially - but hollowly, as it turned out - to have put an end to ''lack of discipline in any way or form.''\nThe Treaty\nEleven days before Mr. Sadat made his trip to Jerusalem, he said in Cairo that he was willing to go to ''the ends of the earth,'' and even to the Israeli Parliament, in the cause\nof peace. The Israeli Government made known that he was welcome in Jerusalem, and after complex negotiations he flew there, although a state of war still existed between the two nations.\nHis eyes were moist and his lips taut with suppressed emotion as he arrived, but his Arabic was firm and resonant when, hours later, he told the hushed Israeli Parliament, ''If you want to\nlive with us in this part of the world, in sincerity I tell you that we welcome you among us with all security and safety.''\nPraising Mr. Sadat's initiative, Prime Minister Begin said, ''We, the Jews, know how to appreciate such courage.'' Mr. Sadat's flexibility, he said later, stemmed from his\nsolitary confinement as a political prisoner in cell 54 of Cairo Central Prison in 1947 and 1948. ''My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded place taught me that he who\ncannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality and will never, therefore, make any progress,'' he wrote in his memoirs, ''In Search of Identity,''\nwhich appeared in 1978, eight years after he assumed the Presidency.\nPact Signed at White House\nHis willingness to make such a change led to the treaty that, after many snags, he and Prime Minister Begin signed at the White House on March 26, 1979. Before reaching agreement Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin\nhad drawn-out and sometimes acrimonious negotiations, for which they were the joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.\nThe treaty provided that Israel return to Egypt in phases the entire Sinai Peninsula, which the Israelis seized in the 1967 war. It also envisioned internal autonomy for the Palestinian Arabs of the\nWest Bank of the Jordan River under continued Israeli control. The Egyptian and Israeli Governments were helped and prodded by the Nixon and Carter Administrations, and Henry A. Kissinger, after\nmany meetings with Mr. Sadat, wrote that the Egyptian leader ''possessed that combinat ion of insight and courage which marks a great statesman.'' The former Secretary of State\ncontinued in his book, ''White House Years'': ''He had the boldness to go to a war no one thought he could sustain; the moderation to move to peace immediately afterward;\nand the wisdom to reverse attitudes hardened by decades.''\nUsed Harmony as a Technique\nIn dealings with Israel and the United States, Mr. Sadat strove to create a harmonious mood that would make it difficult for others to disagree with him. His most audacious use of that technique was\nthe Jerusalem visit.\nThat gesture and the treaty with Israel brought him hatred and vituperation from many Arab leaders. There was particular outrage because the treaty did not provide a timetable for full self-determination\nfor the West Bank Palestinians that would lead eventually to an independent Palestinian state.\nSelf-determination was originally Mr. Sadat's minimum demand; when he settled for less, he found himself virtually isolated in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia's leaders, with whom he had achieved\nwarm relations, cut back their aid to the Egyptian armed forces and the economy, which Mr. Sadat had tried to strengthen by encouraging business.\nThe Saudi action made Egypt more dependent than ever on support from the United States, with which Mr. Sadat had also been careful to cultivate bonds of friendship. Under his predecessor, Gamal Abdel\nNasser, Cairo's relations with the Americans, as with the Saudis, were hostile much of the time. Mr. Sadat won moral and political support from Washington as well as large-scale economic and\nmilitary aid, and in 1975 he became the first Egyptian President to make a state visit to the United States. He returned again during the treaty negotiations, and President Carter went to Egypt,\nwhere throngs hailed him and his host.\nTreaty Welcomed by Egyptians\nMany of the 40 million Egyptians, having gone through four painful and expensive wars with Israel, were enthusiastic about the peace treaty. Throngs of well-wishers danced, waved signs and threw rose\npetals in celebration.\nUnder the treaty Israel's withdrawal of its civilian and military forces from Sinai was to be carried out in stages over three years. Two-thirds of the area was to be handed back within nine months\nafter the exchange of formal ratification documents. In return for the Israeli pullback, Mr. Sadat agreed to establish peace. After the nine-month withdrawal was finished, the two Governments were\nto take up ''normal and friendly relations'' in the diplomatic, economic and cultural spheres, among others. The early withdrawals were completed, and the final phase is scheduled\nfor next April.\n''This is certainly one of the happiest moments of my life,'' Mr. Sadat, deeply moved, said at the signing ceremony. ''In all the steps I took I was merely expressing the\nwill of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.''\nExpels Soviet Advisers\nAnother of Mr. Sadat's major shifts in policy was his departure from Nasser's longstanding pro-Soviet stance. In July 1972 he abruptly ordered the withdrawal of the 25,000 Soviet military specialists\nand advisers in Egypt. By so doing, he later wrote, ''I wanted to tell the whole world that we are always our own masters.''\nThe changes in the relationship with Washington and Moscow were made after Mr. Sadat had concluded that the Arabs could not achieve a satisfactory end to their confrontation with Israel as long as they\nwere allied closely with the Soviet Union while Israel had the all out support of the United States.\nHe was able to make such sharp policy shifts in part because for much of his later tenure as President, his power did not seem to be seriously challenged at home. A career officer and longtime confidant\nof Nasser, he was named Vice President in 1969, came out ahead in a brief power struggle after Nasser's death in 1970 and was formally made President by a rubber-stamp vote of members of the\nArab Socialist Union, the only legal political organization. He consolidated and enlarged his power in the spring of 1971 when, with the aid of the army, he forestalled what he said was a coup and\narrested his opponents.\nCalled Himself a Peasant\nMr. Sadat was widely though not universally popular with the Egyptian people, with whom, in his highly emotional way, he felt a warm and almost mystic bond. In ''In Search of Identity,''\nhe proudly called himself ''a peasant born and brought up on the banks of the Nile.''\nEarly in his presidency, Mr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by eliminating many of the police-state controls that Nasser had relied on to keep himself in power in the years after the officers' revolt\nthat brought down the monarchy in 1952.\nIn 1973 Mr. Sadat did much to build national self-respect when he ordered Egyptian troops to cross the Suez Canal; they managed to overrun the heavily fortified Israeli positions on the east bank within\na few hours. That confidence lingered although the Israelis counterattacked, putting a large tank force on the west bank.\nAs an administrator, he concerned himself with broad lines of policy and for the most part left it to his subordinates to carry it out. Though an emotional man, he could conceal his feelings and be devious.\nHe repeatedly lied his way out of trouble when he was a young officer plotting a military revolt, and as President he pulled off a master stroke of deception when he concealed his preparations for\nthe 1973 war, which began with a surprise attack on Israel.\nMr. Sadat had many quirks. He disliked offices and rarely appeared at Abdin Palace, Cairo's equivalent of the White House, preferring to work in his modest villa and in Government-owned rest houses\naround the country. He wore elegantly cut British-style suits, though even as President he liked to stroll around his native village in a long Arab shirt. He never learned to dance. He could be the\nhigh-toned statesman one minute, relishing his associations with other world leaders, and the humdrum homebody the next, always beginning the day with a dose of Eno's Fruit Salts, a British-made\naid to digestion.\nFirst Steps\nMohammed Anwar el-Sadat was born Dec. 25, 1918, in Mit Abul Kom, a cluster of mud-brick buildings in Minufiya Province between Cairo and Alexandria. He was one of the 13 children of Mohammed el-Sadat,\na Government clerk, and his part-Sudanese wife, a heritage manifest in the boy's skin, darker than the average Egyptian's.\nMinufiya lies in the fertile Nile Delta, its irrigated fields producing rich crops of flax and cotton. In those lush surroundings young Anwar's early years passed happily. He wrote later that he\nhad especially relished the sunrise hour ''when I went out with scores of boys and men, young and old, taking our cattle and beasts of burden to the fields.''\nHis first schooling was at the hands of a kindly Islamic cleric, Sheik Abdul-Hamid, who instilled in him a deep and lasting faith in Islam; as an adult Mr. Sadat bore a dark mark on his forehead, the\nresult of repeatedly touching his head to the floor in prayer.\nToo Poor to Buy Store Bread\nIn 1925 the father was transferred to Cairo, and the family moved into a small house on the outskirts of the capital, not far from Kubba Palace, one of the residences of Egyptian kings. Anwar gave early\nevidence of the audacity he repeatedly showed in later life, stealing apricots from the royal orchard.\nThough the elder Mr. Sadat rose to be a senior clerk, the family was poor, so poor that it could not afford to buy bakery bread. In his memoirs President Sadat said that his early experience of village\nlife, with its ''fraternity, cooperation and love,'' gave him the self-confidence to make his way in the big city, ''It deepened my feeling of inner superiority, a feeling\nwhich has never left me and which, I came to realize, is an inner power independent of all material resources.''\nIn time the proud schoolboy, like other idealistic Egyptians of his generation, came to have a burning political desire: he wanted his country freed of the control of Britain, which had maintained troops\nthere and exercised sway in other ways since the decline of Ottoman Turkish power late in the 19th century.\nWanting to play a role in Egypt's future, Mr. Sadat decided to become an officer. Despite his family's lack of influence, he managed to gain admission to the Royal Military Academy, which was\nonce a preserve of the aristocracy but had begun taking cadets from the middle and lower classes. Graduating in 1938, he was assigned to a signal corps installation near the capital. From that central\nlocation, as he later told it, he became active in the formation of an organization of officers who wanted to mount an armed revolt against the British presence.\nBritain as the Main Foe\nWhen World War II broke out, Captain Sadat continued to regard Britain as the main enemy and took part in a clandestine attempt to fly a former Chief of Staff, Gen. Aziz el-Masri, out of the country\nafter the Germans had sent a message asking him to proceed to Iraq to work against British interests there. The plane crashed, the attempt failed and Captain Sadat was arrested and interrogated but\nlater was released for lack of evidence.\nUndeterred, Captain Sadat made contact with two Nazi agents who passed the evenings watching the dancers at the Kit Kat, a leading Cairo nightclub. Their heavy spending brought them under surveillance,\nthey were arrested and interrogated, and they implicated their contact. As a result a swarm of British and Egyptian detectives and intelligence officers searched Captain Sadat's home. His hidden\ncache of homemade explosives went undetected, b ut he was arrested and sent to a succession of jails. While in jail, he profited from the time by polishing his English and learning German.\nIn 1944 Captain Sadat went on a hunger strike and was transferred to a prison hospital, where he dodged his guard, jumped into a friend's car and escaped. He then grew a beard and lived as a fugitive\nfor a year, helping for a time with work on a resthouse being built for King Farouk, who later was to be ousted by the junta of which Captain Sadat was a part.\nFree to Plot Once Again\nWith the end of the war came the lifting of the martial-law regulations under which Captain Sadat had been detained, enabling him to resume his real identity in freedom. He also resumed plotting against\nthe British and their Egyptian supporters. After a fellow conspirator assassinated Amin Osman Pasha, an aristocrat who favored the British presence, Captain Sadat was tried as a conspirator and acquitted\nin 1948.\nHe worked for a while in a Cairo publishing house and in 1950 got himself reinstated in the army. He was soon promoted, thanks to help from the dissident officers' clandestine network, the Free\nOfficers Organization, which had been growing in size and power under the leadership of an old friend, Lieutenant Colonel Nasser. The colonel summoned Major Sadat to a rendezvous in Cairo on July\n22, 1952, saying the long-awaited uprising, now focused on King Farouk, was to take place soon. When Nasser did not appear, the major took his wife to the movies. Arriving home late in the evening,\nthey found a note from Nasser saying operations were beginning that night and directing Major Sadat to join the revolutionaries.\n''My heart leapt,'' Mr. Sadat recalled in one of his books, ''Revolt on the Nile.'' ''I tore off my civilian clothes and threw on my uniform. In five\nminutes I was at the wheel of my car.''\nAt army headquarters, where the rebels had taken control, Nasser told him to take over the Cairo radio at dawn and to broadcast a proclamation announcing the coup. Major Sadat carried out that historic\ntask after waiting for the daily reading from the Koran to be completed.\nThe revolution led to the exile of Farouk, the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and, before long, the emergence of Nasser as strongman and President.\nWas Underestimated\nAlthough Mr. Sadat filled high posts during the Nasser era, his abilities were underestimated by many influential men in the Nasser entourage. For more than a decade he was given a succession of jobs\nthat were highly visible but of secondary importance. He served as a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, secretary general of an Islamic congress, editor of two newspapers, minister of state\nin the Cabinet; deputy chairman, chairman and speaker of the National Assembly and chairman of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council.\nWhen Nasser named Mr. Sadat Vice President, it was widely thought that he got the job because it was largely ceremonial and had no real power, but supporters of Mr. Sadat have contended that Nasser chose\nhim to be his successor. Nasser, at odds with many other longtime associates, retained warm relations with Mr. Sadat.\nUpon Nasser's death of a heart attack, Mr. Sadat, as the only Vice President, automatically became Acting President under the Constitution. In that office and in his first months as President he\nhad to share power in a collective leadership with others; some colleagues supported him for the presidency because they thought he could be manipulated.\nIn those first weeks many Egyptians, especially students and young intellectuals, found it difficult to take him seriously. With his grin, his fancy suits and his frequent hollow-sounding vows to wage\nwar on Israel, he did not seem to be a strong and purposeful leader.\nPower\nHe showed his strength of will when, after a few months, he moved to consolidate his power by dismissing and imprisoning two of the most powerful figures in the regime, Vice President Ali Sabry, who\nhad close ties with Soviet officials, and Sharawy Gomaa, the Interior Minister, who controlled the secret police.\nMr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by displaying an intuitive sense of what the people wanted. He was doing what they wanted when he cut back the powers of the hated secret police, when he ousted the\nSoviet military experts and when he prepared for war with Israel. Nevertheless, Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister when he took office, correctly appraised him, she later wrote, as a ''reasonable\nman who might soberly consider the benefits'' of ending the confronta tion with Israel.\nEarly in 1973 Mr. Sadat decided to go to war against Israel. He was being criticized by students and others as an ineffective leader, and he concluded that it was necessary to break the Egyptian-Israeli\ndeadlock. ''If we don't take our case into our own hands, there will be no movement,'' he said in an interview. ''The time has come for a shock. The resumption\nof the battle is now inevitable.''\n'Landmark' for Egyptians\nAfter Moscow approved a limited Egyptian invasion of Sinai and after more Soviet arms arrived, Mr. Sadat ordered the attack on Oct. 6. Egyptian troops surged across the canal and Syrian troops struck\nIsrael from their side. In the fighting that followed, the Syrians were thrown back and the Israelis counterattacked fiercely, encircling Suez and carving out a broad bridgehead west of the canal.\nDespite Israel's strong showing, Mr. Sadat, in his memoirs, maintained that ''the Egyptian military performance was a landmark in world military history'' and that ''if\nthe United States hadn't intervened in the war and fully supported Israel, the situation could have been far different.''\nThe war spurred Washington to work to ease tensions in the Middle East; Mr. Sadat was soon visited by Mr. Kissinger. The two hit it off from the first and, Mr. Sadat wrote, began ''a relationship\nof mutual understanding culminating and crystallizing in what we came to describe as a 'peace process.' '' Before long Mr. Kissinger was able to work out a disengagement agreement\nbetween Egypt and Israel that allowed the Egyptians to take back a strip of Sinai. Mr. Sadat welcomed American participation and said later, ''No one else except the United States can play\nthis role of mediator between two sides that harbor intense hate for one another - a gulf of bad blood, violence and massacres.''\nThe agreement, signed in January 1974, was followed by months of ''shuttle diplomacy'' by Mr. Kissinger and by a second limited Egyptian-Israeli accord in September 1975. Efforts\ntoward a more comprehensive peace agreement bore no fruit in the next months, however, although the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on Oct. 1, 1977, on principles to govern a Geneva conference\non the Middle East. Syria continued to resist such a conference.\nNeed for a New Approach\nAt that point Mr. Sadat, not wanting to let Moscow and Damascus determine the pace of events, decided that a new approach was needed. Disregarding objections from his advi sers, he made the trip to Jerusalem.\nHe told the Israeli Parliment that Egypt's willingness to ''welcome you among us'' amounted to ''a decisive historical change,'' but he continued to insist\nthat the Israelis withdraw from occupied Arab land and recognize what he call ed the rights of the Palestinians. He claimed a new-found friendship with Mr. Begin and set in motion the first high-level\nEgyptian-Israeli peace talks.\nWhen Mr. Sadat returned to Cairo, he told his people that ''all barriers of doubt, mistrust and fear were shattered.'' But the negotiations bogged down over differences on the Palestinians\nand other issues; by January 1978 they were deadlocked, with Mr. Sadat denouncing the Israelis as stiff-necked. That deadlock prevailed until Mr. Sadat met with Mr. Begin and President Carter in\nSeptember 1978 at the Camp David conference called by Mr. Carter. Two weeks of talks produced signed agreements on what was called ''a framework for peace.''\nAfter further efforts Mr. Carter flew to Jerusalem and then to Cairo on March 13, 1979, with compromise proposals to break yet another deadlock, and Mr. Sadat approved them quickly in a meeting at a\nCairo airport. Later that month Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin signed the treaty, ending 30 years of Egyptian-Israeli confrontation. ''Let us work together,'' Mr. Sadat said, paraphrasing\nthe Prophet Isaiah, ''until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.''\nIn the hard-line Arab protest against the treaty, 17 Arab nations adopted political and economic sanctions against his Government. Yet his isolation in the Arab world did not undercut his domestic support;\nhe deftly reaped political profit from the isolation by underscoring the idea, widespread in Egypt, that other Arabs had grown wealthy while the Egyptians had borne the burden of the four wars.\nEconomy Displayed Strength\nHis popularity benefited also from the fairly strong condition of the economy, which had seemed on the brink of disaster after Egypt's catastrophic defeat in the 1967 war. By late 1979 the economic\ngrowth rate had reached 9 percent a year and was one of the highest in the developing world, thanks largely to more than $1 billion a year in American aid.\nPresident Sadat's relations with the Americans and the Israelis, despite some intense friction, remained relatively harmonious in the months after the signing of the treaty. That good will paid\noff when, as a gesture of friendship, Mr. Begin fulfilled one provision of the treaty ahead of time, returning a 580-square-mile tract of Sinai to Egypt on Nov. 15, 1979, instead of on Jan. 25, as\nscheduled. Yet no real progress was made in months of Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on home rule for the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nEarly in 1980 Mr. Sadat held inconclusive talks with Mr. Begin at Aswan, in upper Egypt. Israeli forces withdrew from more of Sinai, leaving two-thirds of the area evacuated. The Israeli-Egyptian border\nwas declared open, and the two countries exchanged ambassadors. In March 1980 Mr. Sadat drew new criticism at home and in unfriendly Arab capitals when the deposed Shah of Iran, who was ill, moved\nto Cairo, accepting a longstanding invitation.\nAs the new decade got under way, President Sadat seemed confident of his policies, but events seemed to have taken a somewhat unfavorable turn. Cairo's isolation in the Arab world and elsewhere\nin the third world was galling, and the almost total reliance on Washington for food, aid and weapons was a source of concern.Inflation was running at a rate of 30 percent a year, there were signs\nof increasing repression, and Israel's policy of multiplying settlements on the occupied West Bank intensified pessimism.\nIn April 1980 President Sadat visited Washington to discuss the Israeli settlements with President Carter. From there he denounced the Israeli policy as ''unfounded, ill-conceived and illegal.''\nDissent\nIn the final months of Mr. Sadat's life, as his intricate and sometimes stormy dialogue with Israel continued, there were repeated expressions of internal opposition to his rule. They continued,\nand mounted, despite his general popularity and his continued use of such means as government food-subsidies to dampen disconent.\nEarly this year Egypt's leftist National Unionist Progressive Party publicly denounced Mr. Sadat's policies toward Israel. ''This so-called normalization with the Israeli enemy was\ndone at the expense of the Arabs and was opposed by a growing number of Egyptians,'' a party statement said.\nIn June a Government prosecutor said a former Egyptian Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Saad Eddin el-Shazli, and 18 other Egyptian dissidents living abroad had plotted to overthrow Mr. Sadat. They were said\nto have been given $2.8 million by Libya at Syria's urging. And the head of the Egyptian Bar Association complained that Mr. Sadat's regime was trying to dismember the as sociation's\nleadership because it had opposed the peace treaty with Israel.\nYet Mr. Sadat continued to give much of his attention to foreign affairs. In June he met inconclusively with Mr. Begin, for the first time in 17 months. In the meeting in an abandoned restaurant at Sharm\nel Sheik in Sinai, the Israeli leader rejected Mr. Sadat's appeal to halt Israeli attacks on Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.\nDenounced Bombing of Iraq\nA few days later Mr. Sadat was denouncing Israel for its bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, which he called an ''unlawful, provocative'' act. It was embarrassing to him because\nMr. Begin had told him nothing about it.\nOn Aug. 3 Egypt and Israel signed an agremeent establishing a 2,500-member international peacekeeping force in Sinai to police their peace treaty. On Aug. 5 and 6 Mr. Sadat held friendly but inconclusive\ntalks with President Reagan in Washington. And on Aug. 25 and 26 he and Mr. Begin met yet again, this time in the Egyptian port of Alexandria, to try to resolve problems that had delayed normalization\nof relations.\nBut then Mr. Sadat turned his full attention to internal affairs, evidently acting in response to information about the extent of dissidence in his perennially unstable land. Citing Moslem and other\nopposition to his regime, he departed markedly from the largely velvet-glove treatment of opponents that had characterized his 11 years of rule.\nHe cracked down hard, detaining 1,600 opponents, mostly Moslem militants, partly in response to bloody rioting in June between Moslems and members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. After a hastily\ncalled referendum, his Government reported that 99.45 percent of the voters endorsed its measures to curb secular as well as religious dissidence. Moslem dissidents resented the rapprochement with\nIsrael and wanted a more Islamic cast to Egypt's government.\n'Suffering' From Democracy\nAt a news conference Sept. 9, Mr. Sadat made a wry reference to his country's heritage of violence and to the opposition to his rule. To a foreign reporter who asked an impertinent question, he\nsaid, ''In other times I would have shot you, but it is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.''\nAlso last month Mr. Sadat accused a dozen former Egyptian officials of ''conniving'' with the Soviet Union to destabilize his Government. He ordered the expulsion of more than 1,000\nSoviet citizens, including the Soviet Ambassador, Vladimir P. Polyakov.\nThe Government-supervised Egyptian press reported that Egyptian intelligence had uncovered anti-Government plotting by Soviet agents in league with Egyptian religious extremists, leftists, Nasserites,\neducators, journalists and others.\nLater in the month - even as officials of Egypt, Israel and the United States held talks in Cairo seeking a plan for self-rule for Palestinians - Mr. Sadat's Government took further action to quell\ndissidence. Among other measures, uniformed guards in university campuses were reinforced. A sweeping investigation of the bureaucracy was decreed.\nSaid Indiscipline Had Ended\nIn a widely quoted speech, Mr. Sadat asserted, in what proved to be a display of overconfidence, that all of Egypt's internal indiscipline had come to a halt.\n''Lack of discipline in any way or form,'' he said, in a two-hour televised address, ''in the streets, in the Government, in the university, in the secondary schools, in\nthe factory, in the public sector, in the private sector, this all has ended, it has ended.''\nIn Israel, however, a long-time observer of Mr. Sadat was already speaking of the possibility that his work might be snuffed out. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Raphael Eitan, said bleakly,\n''There are troubles in Egypt, and it is possible that President Sadat will go and everything will come to an end.''\nMr. Sadat was divorced from his first wife, who was from his native village; they had three daughters. His second wife, Jihan, has played a strong role in public affairs, particularly concerning the\ncondition of women and children. The four children of his second marriage are a son, Gamal, named for Nasser, and three daughters, Lubna, Noha and Jihan.\n''In Egypt, personalities have always been more important than political programs.'' - ''Revolt on the Nile,'' 1957.\n''Don't ask me to make diplomatic relations with them. Never. Never. Leave it to the coming generations to decide that, not me.'' - On Israel in 1970, a few months before he became President.\n''The situation here - mark my words - will be worse than Vietnam.'' - In a magazine interview, July 1973.\n''We have always felt the sympathy of the world, but we would prefer the respect of the world to sympathy without respect.'' - In a speech to the People's Assembly after the\nfirst attack of the Yom Kippur war, Oct. 6, 1973.\n''Let every girl, let every woman, let every mother here - and there in my country - know we shall solve all our problems through negotiations around the table rather than starting war.''\n- During his visit to Israel, November 1977.\n''I have a great ally in Israel that I depend upon. Do you know who? The Israeli mother.'' - Commenting on the vote of approval by Israel's Parliament of the peace treaty between\nEgypt and Israel, March 22, 1979.\n''In all the steps I took I was not performing a personal mission. I was merely expressing the will of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.\n''Today a new dawn is emerging out of the darkness of the past. ''Let us work together until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning\nhooks.'' - At the peace treaty signing between Egypt and Israel at the White House, March 26, 1979. ''There will be no barriers between our peoples, no more anxiety or insecurity,\nnot more suffering or suspicion.'' - Meeting with Menachem Begin at Beersheba, May 27, 1979.\n''It is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.'' -Speaking to foreign journalists of unrest in Egypt, Sept. 9, 1981.", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1225.html", "tags": [{"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.78936"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.61135"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.24740"}, {"label": "deaths (obituaries)", "score": "0.18013"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.14079"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.13639"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.03760"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.03511"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.02220"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.01856"}, {"label": "israel-international relations-syria", "score": "0.01477"}, {"label": "israel-international relations-jordan", "score": "0.01280"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01272"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01147"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01044"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.00945"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00840"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00836"}, {"label": "deaths", "score": "0.00743"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.00702"}, {"label": "arabs", "score": "0.00698"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.00655"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.00616"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.00598"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.00566"}, {"label": "theater", "score": "0.00523"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00475"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.00470"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.00462"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.00391"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Israel", "Jerusalem", "Egypt", "Egypt", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Jerusalem", "Cairo", "Jerusalem", "Israel", "Egypt", "West Bank", "Israel", "the United States", "Jerusalem", "Israel", "West Bank", "Saudi Arabia's", "Egypt", "the United States", "Cairo", "Washington", "the United States", "Egypt", "Israel", "Israel", "Sinai", "Egypt", "Washington", "Moscow", "Israel", "the Soviet Union", "Israel", "the United States", "the west bank", "Israel", "Cairo", "Minufiya Province", "Cairo", "Alexandria", "Cairo", "Britain", "Egypt", "Britain", "Britain", "Iraq", "Cairo", "Cairo", "Cairo", "Cairo", "Egypt", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Moscow", "Sinai", "Israel", "Israel", "the United States", "Israel", "Washington", "Egypt", "Israel", "Sinai", "the United States", "the United States", "the Soviet Union", "Geneva", "Syria", "Moscow", "Damascus", "Jerusalem", "Egypt", "Cairo", "Jerusalem", "Cairo", "Cairo", "Egypt", "Egypt", "Sinai", "Egypt", "the West Bank", "the Gaza Strip", "Aswan", "Egypt", "Sinai", "Iran", "Cairo", "Cairo", "Washington", "Israel", "West Bank", "Washington", "Israel", "Egypt", "Israel", "Libya", "Syria", "Israel", "Sharm\nel Sheik", "Sinai", "Lebanon", "Iraq", "Israel", "Egypt", "Israel", "Sinai", "Washington", "Alexandria", "Egypt", "Israel", "Egypt", "the Soviet Union", "Egypt", "Israel", "the United States", "Cairo", "Egypt", "Israel", "Egypt", "Egypt", "Israel", "Vietnam", "Israel", "Israel", "Israel", "Egypt", "Israel", "Egypt", "Israel", "Beersheba", "Egypt"], "ORG": ["the Daring Arab Pioneer of Peace", "The Treaty\nEleven days", "the Israeli Parliament", "The Israeli Government", "Search of Identity", "White House", "the White House", "Carter Administrations", "State", "White House", "the\nArab Socialist Union", "Search of Identity", "the White House", "Eno's Fruit Salts", "Minufiya", "Islam", "the Royal Military Academy", "Main Foe", "the Free\nOfficers Organization", "the Revolutionary Command Council", "Cabinet", "the National Assembly", "the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council", "Interior", "confronta", "National Unionist Progressive Party", "the Egyptian Bar Association", "Said Indiscipline Had Ended", "the People's Assembly", "Parliament"], "PERSON": ["Anwar el-Sadat", "ERIC", "Sadat", "Sadat", "Sadat", "Anwar el-Sadat", "Sadat", "Carter", "Reagan", "Menachem Begin", "Sadat", "Sadat", "Begin", "Sadat", "Sadat", "Begin", "Nixon", "Henry A.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nAs President Trump prepares to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G-20 gathering in Argentina this weekend, tough American tariffs and a broader bilateral trade relationship are at the top the agenda.\nBut what about concerns that the Trump administration has expressed in the past over Beijing\u2019s repression and mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims? Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top lieutenants, like Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have called attention to the Uighurs\u2019 plight, but given the president\u2019s fixation on tariffs, he may well decide to hold his fire about the Uighurs to appease Mr. Xi in pursuit of a trade deal. So it\u2019s no surprise that the White House is refusing to say whether the Uighurs will be on the agenda.\nThe dilemma Mr. Trump faces has some faint echoes from 1989, when President George H.W. Bush had to figure out how to recalibrate relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Of course, Mr. Trump lacks the experience or subtlety that Mr. Bush \u2014 a former director of the C.I.A. and envoy to China \u2014 brought to that fraught diplomatic moment.\nMr. Bush \u201cwanted to safeguard the underlying geopolitical relationship,\u201d his secretary of state, James Baker, wrote in October. Still, Mr. Baker added, \u201cThe United States could not be viewed as a cynical paper tiger on human rights.\u201d\nAt that time, China was just beginning the economic reforms that would eventually make it an international force to be reckoned with, and relations with the United States were at a peak. Responding to pressure from Congress and international outrage over the widely publicized Tiananmen Square killings, the Bush administration imposed limited sanctions on Beijing while maintaining dialogue with Chinese officials.\nToday, when another, more hostile strategic realignment between Beijing and Washington seems to be underway, there is again an urgent need to address at the highest levels of the American government what have been described as China\u2019s worst human rights abuses in decades. They are largely happening in secret to a group of people who are little known outside China.\nMr. Xi has imposed China\u2019s most sweeping internment program since Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution, when more than a million people were killed and millions of others were imprisoned, tortured and humiliated.\nAs Mr. Pompeo and other senior officials have acknowledged, Chinese officials are forcibly holding hundreds of thousands \u2014 perhaps more than one million \u2014 Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims in camps across the northwest Central Asian border region of Xinjiang without any formal legal process.\nThere have been credible reports of torture, starvation and death in the camps. There are, as well, accusations that officials have forced detainees to renounce traditional Islamic practices and swear allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, CNN reported that a Chinese photojournalist, Lu Guang, had disappeared in China after being seized by authorities in Xinjiang.\nOverlaying all of this is a sophisticated surveillance system that uses cameras, biometric data and phone apps to reinforce state control. Officials reportedly have also deployed more than a million Chinese civilians, mostly members of the country\u2019s Han majority, to occupy the homes of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang in order to indoctrinate and monitor them. The Uighurs, numbering about 11 million, are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang.\nBeijing argues that the crackdown is needed to combat extremism and terrorism on its western frontier and says that many of those detained are common criminals. But Mr. Pompeo has said that Uighur \u201creligious beliefs are decimated.\u201d\nAnd Mr. Pence, in a hard-hitting speech in October, lambasted a \u201cnew wave of persecution\u201d that is \u201ccrashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists and Muslims.\u201d He said the Uighurs \u201cendure round-the-clock brainwashing\u201d as part of a \u201cdeliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith.\u201d\nSuch rhetoric helped focus more international attention on the campaign of oppression against the Uighurs, but it\u2019s not nearly enough. While Western countries have begun to speak out, where is the outrage from Muslim countries? Why aren\u2019t China\u2019s neighbors demanding an end to the abuses?\nThe world can ill afford to remain mute, as it did for too long when the generals in Myanmar began unleashing genocide against the Rohingyas, members of a Muslim ethnic group that have been killed by the thousands and forced to flee to Bangladesh.\nFor several months, administration officials have been discussing whether to impose punitive measures on China over its treatment of Uighurs.

Raids Home of Atlantic City Mayor Frank Gilliam\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe mayor of Atlantic City made headlines last month when he was involved in a fight outside a casino that was captured on video. The mayor, Frank Gilliam, was not charged.\nBut Mr. Gilliam may be facing more serious trouble. Early Monday, federal officials raided his home, removing computer equipment and boxes in an operation that represents another setback for this struggling seaside city.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. was at the mayor\u2019s home in Atlantic City in an official capacity executing a search warrant,\u201d said Doreen Holder, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.\u2019s office in Newark. Ms. Holder said the I.R.S. was also involved in the search, but she declined to offer any other details.\nVideo posted on social media showed about a dozen agents going in and out of the home on Ohio Avenue.\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to comment about what prompted the raid.\n\u201cWe can tell you that the mayor\u2019s office is open, and we are here to provide services to Atlantic City residents and to serve the administration in any way that we can,\u201d said Christina Bevilacqua, the deputy chief of staff in the mayor\u2019s office.\nShortly after 12:30 p.m. Monday, Mr. Gilliam emerged from his house and left in a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. He did not respond to shouted questions from reporters gathered at the end of his driveway.\nThe F.B.I. operation is the latest chapter in what has been a tumultuous couple of months for Mr. Gilliam, a Democrat. The late-night brawl he was involved in took place outside the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City; surveillance video obtained from the casino showed the mayor swinging wildly at an unknown man. Casino security intervened to break up the fight.\nThe cause of the melee has never been made clear. Prosecutors said they would not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Gilliam.\nMr. Gilliam has also faced complaints about his campaign finances. The mayor and the Atlantic City Democratic Committee quarreled over a $10,000 check that had been made out to the committee, but that Mr. Gilliam deposited into his campaign account.\nThe committee filed a criminal complaint in March, but a judge later dismissed the case.\nMr. Gilliam was elected in 2017, defeating the incumbent mayor Don Guardian, a Republican who had clashed frequently with the administration of former Gov. Chris Christie over the state\u2019s decision to take over Atlantic City\u2019s finances. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy as its casino industry struggled.\nMr. Gilliam, a native of Atlantic City who had served as a city councilman since 2009, campaigned on a \u201cnew era\u201d message, saying that Atlantic City\u2019s struggles were the result of poor management of city government and the casinos. He faulted Mr. Guardian for allowing the state takeover and said the largely Democratic city needed to return to its Democratic roots.\nHe promised to court developers and bring in businesses. Since taking office, two casinos have opened where old ones had shuttered.\nBut he also promised to broaden Atlantic City\u2019s appeal, seeking to establish the resort city as a family-friendly destination.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our identity because of gaming,\u201d Mr. Gilliam said during the campaign. \u201cIf everyone got to the table, Atlantic City would find its way.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. raid on Mr. Gilliam\u2019s home, however, is a reminder of the long history of criminal behavior among some of Atlantic City\u2019s top public officials.\nRobert W. Levy, who was elected mayor in 2006, disappeared in 2007 amid rumors of a pending federal investigation into his military record and benefits. He was found to have checked into an addiction and rehabilitation facility in central New Jersey, and later admitted in court to falsifying his military records to receive veterans benefits.\nIn 1991, James L. Usry, who had been mayor for six years and was Atlantic City\u2019s first elected African-American mayor, pleaded guilty to campaign contribution violations after prosecutors accused of him accepting $6,000 in cash and a $500 check in exchange for supporting an ordinance that would have benefited a business owned by the donor. Mr. Usry and four city councilmen were indicted.\nAnd in 1984, Michael J. Matthews, who had been elected mayor in 1982, was charged with extortion, bribery and conspiracy as part of a wide-ranging sting operation against organized crime. Federal authorities said he maintained a close relationship with Nicodemo \u201cLittle Nicky\u201d Scarfo, an infamous organized crime leader, that predated Mr. Matthews\u2019s election as mayor. Mr. Matthews pleaded guilty to a single count of extortion.\nAtlantic City also played a central role in the Abscam scandal, which resulted in the convictions of several members of Congress on charges of bribery and political corruption, including Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey.\nAt the center of the scandal were promises for casino partnerships and revenue in Atlantic City.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you Atlantic City \u2014 without me, you do nothing,\u201d Angelo J. Errichetti, who was then mayor of Camden, N.J., boasted to an undercover agent about arranging a casino license for a $50,000 kickback.\nAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/mayor-frank-gilliam-atlantic-city.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.10095"}, {"label": "mayors", "score": "0.05754"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.05004"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03387"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.02801"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02795"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.02716"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.01851"}, {"label": "games", "score": "0.01675"}, {"label": "gambling", "score": "0.01541"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01508"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.01425"}, {"label": "real estate", "score": "0.01145"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01097"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01095"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.00886"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00854"}, {"label": "casinos", "score": "0.00838"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00769"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00740"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00607"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.00553"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.00529"}, {"label": "search and seizure", "score": "0.00439"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.00407"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00396"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00389"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.00387"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.00386"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00379"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Newark", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "New Jersey", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "New Jersey", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Camden", "N.J."], "ORG": ["F.B.I.

The students\u2019 relatives, many from rural communities in Mexico\u2019s poorest states, sat in the front row of the president\u2019s first public event at the National Palace, holding large images of their missing sons.\nAlejandro Encinas, the incoming deputy interior minister for human rights, will head the commission. It will start a new investigation under a special prosecutor\u2019s office and will aim to consider all leads, including those that were ignored or discarded by the former government.\nThe students, who were studying to be rural teachers, disappeared in September 2014 from the southern city of Iguala, after the municipal police attacked the buses they were riding. The government of former President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto said that the students were then handed over to a local drug gang, which killed them and burned their bodies in a nearby garbage dump. The remains of only one student have been identified.\nThe case soon became a symbol of widespread disappearances, violence and corruption in Mexico \u2014 and the impunity with which such crimes were carried out.\nThe commission will include the students\u2019 relatives and their advocates, as well as government officials. As part of their mandate, its members will consider the recommendations issued by international experts from the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights. Experts appointed by the commission reviewed the case in 2015 and rejected the official account of events.\nThe government, granting one of the main demands of victims\u2019 advocates, will invite members of both international organizations to help supervise the new efforts.\nOnly last week, the National Human Rights Commission, an autonomous government agency, published a report that sharply criticized the former government\u2019s handling of the case, citing a list of irregularities and failures, including signs that key witnesses had been tortured.\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Saturday, won a landslide election five months ago on a wave of anger about rampant violence and corruption, and fulfilled a campaign promise to create the commission with his first public decree.\nThe students\u2019 relatives have led street protests and rallies for four years to condemn what they called the mishandling of the case, which they said deprived them of the truth and justice.\nThey have demanded a transparent and effective inquiry that follows the leads that contradicted the official account.\n\u201cWe ask you, as a father, to help us, to pull us out of this dumpster where Pe\u00f1a Nieto left us, and for you to gain the trust of all Mexicans, because we don\u2019t trust anyone anymore,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, the mother of one of the missing students, referring to the former president. The flawed investigation prompted a national outcry, and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s approval ratings plummeted.\nIn a detailed investigation of the case, experts from the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights said there was no physical evidence to sustain the former government\u2019s account. After they announced their preliminary conclusions, members of the panel said they were subjected to a campaign of harassment and interference.\nEvidence later emerged showing that some of the lawyers, journalists and activists looking into the case were targeted with surveillance technology bought by the Mexican government.\nThe creation of the new commission was first ordered by a federal court in Mexico this summer, in response to legal motions filed by suspects in the abduction who accused the government of using torture to force confessions. The experts who first reported suspicions of torture warned that such violations could undermine the legality of the entire investigation.\nMr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto had refused the court\u2019s order, saying it had no authority over the matter. His government\u2019s position on the case infuriated relatives of the missing, and drew outrage from others whose families had suffered similar violence.\n\u201cWe ask the rest of the country to put themselves in our shoes for just one day, for them to feel what it is to have a loved one missing,\u201d Ms. Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not only our 43, there are thousands of other families suffering.\u201d\nFollow Paulina Villegas on Twitter: @Paulina_VV.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/world/americas/mexico-missing-students-president.html", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.36745"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.30149"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.21784"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.14611"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.14505"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.12651"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.06519"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.04097"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.04026"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.03080"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.02446"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.02151"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01906"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01759"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.01348"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.01267"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01158"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01106"}, {"label": "indians, american", "score": "0.01103"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.01062"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.01038"}, {"label": "discrimination", "score": "0.01032"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.00991"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00954"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00945"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.00940"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.00911"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.00832"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.00804"}, {"label": "bribery", "score": "0.00790"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Mexico", "MEXICO CITY", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Iguala", "Mexico", "Mexico"], "ORG": ["the United Nations", "the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights", "the National Human Rights Commission", "the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights"], "PERSON": ["Andr\u00e9s Manuel", "L\u00f3pez Obrador", "L\u00f3pez Obrador", "Alejandro Encinas", "Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "L\u00f3pez Obrador", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Pe\u00f1a Nieto", "Mart\u00ednez", "Paulina Villegas"]}}, {"index": 11, "year": 2018, "title": "New York Police Say They Will Deploy 14 Drones", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/nyregion/nypd-drones.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nNew York Police Say They Will Deploy 14 Drones\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nLaw-enforcement agencies across the country have adopted aerial drones to map crime scenes, monitor large events and aid search-and-rescue operations. But the high-flying devices have also triggered backlash over fears they will be used to spy on law-abiding citizens.\nThe New York Police Department on Tuesday unveiled plans to deploy 14 of the unmanned fliers and to train 29 officers to operate them, opening an intense debate about whether an agency previously criticized for illegally surveilling citizens should possess such powerful technology.\nSenior police officials said the drones would be used for monitoring giant crowds, investigating hazardous waste spills, handling hostage situations and reaching remote areas in crime scenes, among other tasks. They will not be used for routine police patrols, unlawful surveillance or to enforce traffic laws, the officials said. Nor will they be equipped with weapons.\n\u201cDrone technology will give our cops and their incident commanders an opportunity to see what they\u2019re getting into before they go into harm\u2019s way,\u201d Chief of Department Terence A. Monahan said. \u201cFor this reason alone, it would be negligent for us not to use this technology.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cLet me be clear: N.Y.P.D. drones will not be used for warrantless surveillance.\u201d\nBut lawyers specializing in civil liberty cases who reviewed the department\u2019s proposed drone policy said it did not go far enough in preventing the police from misusing the devices. Advocates for police reform expressed alarm about the department\u2019s growing surveillance capacity. Aside from drones, the police have thousands of cameras in public places, license plate readers and devices that can siphon information from cellphones by mimicking cellphone towers.\nChristopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said police officials rejected recommendations that would have required the department to regularly disclose how often they use the drones and why.\nThe N.Y.P.D. will voluntarily report aggregate data regarding the drone program, said Devora Kaye, a department spokeswoman.\nThe department\u2019s policy also allows the use of drones for any \u201cpublic safety\u201d reason the Chief of Department deems necessary. That leaves room for the police to use the drones however they want, with no public oversight, Mr. Dunn said.\n\u201cI understand why they want us to bless it, but we\u2019re not going to bless it,\u201d he said.\nOther critics, including public defenders and elected officials, have also raised concerns the drones might be used to spy on black and Hispanic neighborhoods that have long been targets of aggressive policing practices. These detractors also have raised the possibility the video from the drones could also be exploited by the Trump administration to target immigrants.\nDan Gettinger, the co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, said privacy concerns are likely to grow as the technology becomes more widespread and the capabilities of the machines increase. More than 900 law enforcement agencies currently use them, he said.\n\u201cDrones are a very dynamic platform,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re one thing today, but the technology is going to evolve and sensors are going to become more sophisticated.\u201d\nThe use of drones by police departments soared after the federal government eased licensing requirements in 2016. The Las Vegas police have used them to monitor New Year\u2019s Eve festivities on The Strip, and the police in Cleveland have used them to pursue suspects.\nBut protests surfaced over their use in Los Angeles, and in Seattle, where public pressure forced the police to ground their drones in 2013.\nThe New York State Police have 18 drones, which troopers use for tasks like finding missing people and projecting flood depths. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to use a drone than to launch one of our helicopters, and it\u2019s less expensive,\u201d Beau Duffy, a spokesman, said.\nPolice officials in New York City said they were considering using drones in 2014, and last year the department ordered three for testing. By June, the department had purchased 14. The program cost about $480,000.\nMany police departments have started drone programs without the blessing of local authorities, purchasing the devices with federal funds, private donations or through loopholes in procurement processes. The New York Police Department, however, consulted with local elected leaders, among others, on a policy for using drones before they were deployed, officials said.\nOfficials demonstrated the devices at a closed-door meeting with a few City Council members on Sept. 27 at Police Headquarters, then met with the civil liberties lawyers to discuss the policy on Oct. 5.\nDonovan Richards, a Democrat and the chairman of the City Council\u2019s Committee on Public Safety, said the police were right to seek outside input before launching the drones.\nAlthough Mr. Richards said he understood the potential value of the flying devices, he said he would seek to fast-track legislation requiring the police to report on how often the department uses drones and why, and establishing privacy safeguards.\n\u201cWhat we want to avoid is \u2018mission creep,\u2019 where you start with the use of drones for traffic and before you know it, it\u2019s being used for surveillance,\u201d Mr. Richards said.\nBut some critics said the secrecy surrounding the program has fueled skepticism of the agency\u2019s willingness to operate transparently.\n\u201cDrones are serious surveillance tools that can be weaponized,\u201d said Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform, an umbrella coalition. The lack of public input and oversight in developing the drones program \u201creflects a dangerous anti-democratic pattern of the de Blasio administration and the N.Y.P.D. that disregards the perspectives of communities most impacted by police abuses,\u201d she added.\nThe Police Department bought the drones between April and June from DJI Technology, a company based in China. Eleven of the devices are Mavic Pro quadcopters, which measure less than two feet in diameter. Two of them are M210 RTK quadcopters, which are larger, weather-resistant models equipped with powerful camera lenses capable of thermal and three-dimensional imaging. The police also bought a DJI Inspire quadcopter for training pilots.\nEach drone is flown by a two-person team from the Technical Assistance Response Unit: One officer mans the controls, while the second monitors the device while it is in flight.\nAt a demonstration at Fort Totten in Queens, police drone pilots demonstrated several scenarios in which the devices could be helpful. One drone was used to provide an overview of a scene meant to resemble a fatal car crash. In the second scenario, two drones were flown to take pictures of a mock hazardous materials leak involving a van.\nThe larger drone provided thermal imaging of the smoking car while the smaller drone flew close enough to get a vantage on the vehicle\u2019s open doors. The final drill involved using a drone to find a person posing as a lost child in a city park.\nAn earlier version of this article mistakenly described a pilot program in Brooklyn in 2011. The pilot program did not include drones.\nHow we handle corrections", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/nyregion/nypd-drones.html", "tags": [{"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.24594"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.22199"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.16209"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.11563"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.05876"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.05674"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.04556"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.04031"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.03523"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.02674"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02418"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02330"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.01983"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.01967"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.01808"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01767"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.01707"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.01702"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.01684"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.01649"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01617"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.01562"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01456"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.01450"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.01390"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.01274"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01272"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.01092"}, {"label": "brutality and harassment charges", "score": "0.01081"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.01045"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York Police Say", "New York", "Las Vegas", "Cleveland", "Los Angeles", "Seattle", "New York City", "China", "M210", "Queens", "Brooklyn"], "ORG": ["The New York Police Department", "the New York Civil Liberties Union", "the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College", "The New York State Police", "The New York Police Department", "City Council", "Police Headquarters", "the City Council\u2019s Committee on Public Safety", "Communities United for Police Reform", "The Police Department", "DJI Technology", "the Technical Assistance Response Unit"], "PERSON": ["Terence A.

Our photographer spent three days behind the scenes.\nSupported by\nNeon hues of orange and pink glistened off the wet sidewalks and the fulsome chrome grills of a Buick Super and Ford Customline. Outside a diner, under bluish curls of cigarette smoke, a crowd milled around in the darkness. Men well under the age of 70 unironically wore pants hitched high above their waists. And women accessorized their outfits with pillbox hats and pearls, illuminated by the glow of a storefront window rather than a smartphone.\nExperiencing these predawn tableaux late last summer, it was as if one city block\u2019s worth of mid-20th-century Americana had seeped from a well-preserved Kodachrome photo onto the streets of the West Village. But these street scenes were actually the stunning handiwork of the creators and the behind-the-scenes magicians of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d about an Upper West Side housewife (Rachel Brosnahan) who aspires to be a comedian in the New York of the late 1950s. (The show returned for a second season on Amazon on Wednesday.)\nWhile period pieces are nothing new, the attention to detail on \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d transcends the usual nostalgic kitsch. As much consideration is paid to the paper coffee cups, pretzel tins and No. 2 pencils as to the dresses, suits and hats. Hoping to capture not just the look but the feel of the era, I photographed over several days and one long night the meticulous transformation of an old Williamsburg bank into the B. Altman department store, a Midtown Manhattan television studio into a telethon set circa 1959, and, for a flashback scene, a West Village luncheonette into a period diner. And to learn how \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d pulls off these dramatic changes, and what it\u2019s like to be enveloped in this throwback world, Alexis Soloski spoke to the key members of the production team and an assortment of extras. \u2014 TODD HEISLER\n\u201cI love that era. I was born in 1947, so I kind of relate to it. You hold your head up with a hat on and you smile differently, and you carry your handbag differently. You feel good.\u201d \u2014 Carmen Cooper, an extra (below)\nOne of the charms of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d is the way it whooshes viewers back to a dream of 1950s New York \u2014 a city of flair and sass. The colors sing; the interiors gleam. But the fantasy is deeply rooted in realism.\n\u201cWe make sure all the details are just right,\u201d said Bill Groom, the show\u2019s production designer. \u201cThe color palette\u2019s very important, the types of fabric, the technology of the period. We look through electrical catalogs and plumbing catalogs. When we go into a modern location, we change light switches and all sorts of things to make it real. We don\u2019t want anything to pull the viewers out of the story.\u201d\n\u201cBackground work is a chance to meet people from a whole array of careers. It\u2019s fun! And then you get that extra boost when family and friends say, I saw you on TV, even though it\u2019s four or five seconds and you were blurred.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Barksdale, extra (above, far right)\nThe energy and vitality of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d depends on some active and surprisingly inventive camera work. The penultimate episode of the new season includes scenes set at a telethon. David Mullen, the show\u2019s director of photography, couldn\u2019t find working cameras of the period so he had dummy bodies built and inserted small black-and-white surveillance cameras underneath them.\n\u201cWe actually hired Local 600 camera operators,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cA lot of them had live TV experience \u2014 they\u2019ve worked on various New York shows like \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \u2014 so they knew how to use a pedestal camera. I couldn\u2019t use our own camera operators because they were actually shooting the operators shooting the scene! It got quite complex. I had three camera crews shooting the three camera crews shooting the telethon.\u201d\n\u201cI will say, that\u2019s the largest hat I\u2019ve ever worn, it was so grand. There was a real sense of femininity and luxury.\u201d \u2014 Courtney Leigh Halford, featured extra (above, right)\n\u201cWhen the assistant put me in the bra and the slip and I looked in the mirror at the very different body silhouette, she said to me, \u2018Welcome to the \u201950s.\u2019\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Kilburg Reedy, extra (below, far left)\nDonna Zakowska\u2019s title is costume designer, but she\u2019s responsible for much more. Every accessory and ornament \u2014 the hats, the gloves, the shoes, the stockings, the handbags, the jewelry, the ties, the handkerchiefs, the cuff links \u2014 fall under her purview.\n\u201cIn terms of the men\u2019s clothing, I used a lot of photos of Cary Grant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat look is very classic to America \u2014 there\u2019s a simplicity, a directness, a square, more boxy cut, very elegant. In 2018, some men don\u2019t even know how to tie a tie, forget a bow tie. You also have to tell them, \u2018Please, can you pull up your pants.\u2019 For women, there is much more of an emphasis on clean lines and shape and the contrast between the waist and the hips.\u201d\n\u201cWe never want to go over the top with accessories, they just have to all work together. Every morning, before Rachel goes on set, we usually have the clothes in place and I have a tray filled with certain jewelry choices. We like to spend a few minutes playing. It\u2019s the last thing, the cherry on the cake.\u201d\nWhen actors come in off the street, they\u2019re scrubbed clean, then made up in a late-\u201950s style, under the direction of Patricia Regan, the head of the makeup department.\n\u201cI have to be honest with you, I don\u2019t wear any makeup \u2014 not ever,\u201d she confided. \u201cBut for the show, I have one red lipstick that I absolutely love. It\u2019s YSL 201. It\u2019s the red that Rachel wears when she performs in the black dress. It\u2019s a really rich, flawless, beautiful red. I have tried so many red lipsticks in the past couple of years. I would find beautiful colors, but they wouldn\u2019t stay on, they wouldn\u2019t read, but this lipstick is the perfect lipstick.\u201d\nMeanwhile, conjuring 1959 Manhattan on the 2018 New York grid is the job of the locations manager Amanda Foley. To recreate B. Altman & Company, the luxury department store where Midge works, Ms. Foley turned to a former bank building that now houses the Williamsburg Art & Historical Center.\n\u201cA lovely couple who are very into the arts, they rented it to us for two years,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThe bones are there and we were able to have it for the whole first two seasons so we could spend a lot of time in there making it exactly what we needed it to be, this whole beautiful B. Altman department store. The exterior we shot at the original B. Altman department store on 34th Street. It\u2019s now a CUNY library.\u201d\nWhen a diner was called for, Foley located the West Village spot La Bonbonniere. The production rechristened it The City Spoon. The interior was the simple part \u2014 once some photos were removed, it could pass for the era. The hard part? The street outside.\n\u201cWe have to take out the parking signs, we have to take out the bus poles, we have to get permission from the M.T.A. to take those down,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWe have to cover light poles to make them look more 1959. We change light fixtures, we cover signs. We move garbage cans, we move all the cars on the block and replace them with our own cars.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a really nice chunk of a Manhattan block,\u201d she added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was easy for us to turn it into 1959.\u201d\nAdvertisement", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/arts/television/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-costumes-set-design.html", "tags": [{"label": "reviews", "score": "0.32868"}, {"label": "apparel", "score": "0.21047"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.15724"}, {"label": "theater", "score": "0.04985"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.04396"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.04185"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.02363"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.01904"}, {"label": "comedy and humor", "score": "0.01609"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.01606"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01533"}, {"label": "social conditions and trends", "score": "0.01464"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.01442"}, {"label": "trade shows and fairs", "score": "0.01418"}, {"label": "real estate", "score": "0.01394"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.01305"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01099"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.01058"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01027"}, {"label": "men", "score": "0.00857"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.00701"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.00686"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00655"}, {"label": "shows (exhibits)", "score": "0.00652"}, {"label": "life styles", "score": "0.00626"}, {"label": "restaurants", "score": "0.00611"}, {"label": "parties (social)", "score": "0.00608"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00605"}, {"label": "smoking and tobacco", "score": "0.00578"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00576"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "New York", "Williamsburg", "Midtown", "Manhattan", "West Village", "New York", "New York", "America", "Manhattan", "New York", "West Village", "Manhattan"], "ORG": ["Amazon", "Buick Super", "Americana", "Kodachrome", "Amazon", "B.

(Read those here).\nAt times, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s schedule is \u201cmaking it difficult for department heads to advance new ideas at City Hall, or to inform the mayor about problems at their agencies,\u201d The Times\u2019s William Neuman reports.\nJust ask Joe Esposito, commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, whose firing this weekend took three days. Why? Because Mr. Esposito demanded to hear directly from the mayor.\nThe data: In 2015, he averaged 17 days a month at City Hall; in 2016 it fell to 14; last year, it dropped to nine.\nThis year through September, Mr. de Blasio averaged 10 days, according to his schedules.\nThe stay-at-mansion mayor: Mr. de Blasio said he preferred working at his official residence, Gracie Mansion.\n\u201cI have found it\u2019s a very productive place to get work done,\u201d he said. \u201cCity Hall is a wonderful place, I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life there and I\u2019m there on a regular basis, but it is a place filled with a lot of interruptions and distractions.\u201d\nHe said the public should focus on results, not his governing style, and that the city is in strong shape.\nMayor or May-eh? A poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University found that only 43 percent of voters approve of his job performance, the lowest in more than two years.\nThe percentage of voters who say they don\u2019t know or have no opinion of Mr. de Blasio is increasing \u2014 17 percent in Wednesday\u2019s poll, up from 6 percent in May.\nFor emails and memos, first lady follows the mayor\u2019s rules\nThe same rules about preserving documents and emails that apply to Mayor de Blasio also apply to his wife, Chirlane McCray, a spokesman told The Times on Wednesday.\nWhy it matters: City Hall said last week that \u201cCity Hall employees are under no requirement to retain every email ever written or received\u201d by the mayor.\nThat was meant to explain why the administration did not turn over a couple of emails between the mayor and a disgraced political donor that surfaced in a police corruption trial.\nLook ahead: Ms. McCray has long been touted by the mayor as one of his most trusted advisers.

It did not seem unusual given the plethora of double-parked cars on the block.\nRather than straighten out and begin to drive forward, the car continued in reverse through the intersection. And then it turned right.\nThis was the rare part. Because Madison Avenue runs north, the only legal turn at 80th Street would be a left.\nI called 911.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a car going the wrong way down Madison,\u201d I said. \u201cHe might hit someone.\u201d\nThe woman at the other end of the line said she would notify the local police precinct and that they would call me.\nThree minutes later, the police called. Did I know where the car was?\nYes, I said, I was looking at it. It was in front of a hydrant facing the wrong way.\nHad I gotten the license plate number?\nYou bet.\nThe caller said they would \u201cget the guy,\u201d but I heard no sirens and saw no flashing lights, except those of the car lighting up storefronts as it slowly made a U-turn.

The father, No\u00e9 Aguilar, was denied on the spot because American officials worried he lacked strong ties to Guatemala, his native country, and might not return, according to his lawyer, Naimeh Salem.\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, with past administrations, we never had a problem like this,\u201d Ms. Salem, an immigration lawyer based in Texas, said in an interview. \u201cWith this administration, most everything that is discretionary is getting denied.\u201d\nAs the news of Mr. Aguilar\u2019s denial was reported on Thursday in North Carolina, some high-ranking state politicians pledged to help. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wrote a letter asking for the State Department to reconsider the father\u2019s application, Ms. Salem said, and the office of Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican, intervened as well.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful we should be able to get it,\u201d Ms. Salem said.\nIn his letter, Mr. Cooper asked the American ambassador to Guatemala, Luis E. Arreaga, to reconsider the visa applications for Mr. Aguilar. He wrote that other relatives of Hania who live there, including a grandfather and an aunt, had applied for a visa, and some of them were also rejected.\n\u201cAs you can image, the family is devastated by the loss of such a promising young lady who loved her family, friends and was one of the top students in her class,\u201d Mr. Cooper wrote on Thursday. \u201cI urge you to reconsider those decisions and to grant visas to those individuals so that they can properly mourn their lost child in this tragic and extraordinary circumstance.\u201d\nMr. Meadows\u2019s office did not respond to a message seeking comment. A State Department spokeswoman, Nicole Thompson, said she could not comment on specific visa cases.\n\u201cThe Department of State makes every effort to facilitate legitimate travel by international visitors,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are also fully committed to administering U.S. immigration law and ensuring the integrity and security of our country\u2019s borders.\u201d\nResidents of Guatemala must receive a visa to travel to the United States.\nHania was kidnapped on the morning of Nov. 5 outside her mother\u2019s house in a mobile home park in Lumberton, N.C., a city of 21,500 people about 30 miles south of Fayetteville. Witnesses said they saw a man wearing dark clothes and a yellow bandanna force Hania into a sport utility vehicle, the police said.\nThe search for Hania dominated the news across the state and the South, as the F.B.I. joined the case and coordinated a vast search over several weeks. The authorities had few clues. They released surveillance footage from a camera showing the S.U.V. and asked the public to look out for shoes similar to the ones Hania was last seen wearing, black-and-white Adidas sneakers with a colorful logo on the heel.\nAfter a nearly three-week search, the police found Hania\u2019s body off a rural road about seven miles south of Lumberton, the authorities said. The F.B.I. declined to elaborate about why that area had been searched but said agents were following up on \u201cinvestigative leads.\u201d\nA spokeswoman at the F.B.I., which prominently displays information about the case on its website, said on Thursday that the case remained unsolved.\nIn his visa application, Mr. Aguilar stated that he owned a business in Guatemala and had no intentions of staying in the United States after the funeral, Ms. Salem said. But embassy officials denied his request because he had a low bank balance, she said.\n\u201cHe has no negative immigration history,\u201d Ms. Salem said. \u201cNo deportation.\u201d\nMr. Aguilar lived in the United States when his daughter was an infant but moved back to Guatemala around 2005, she said.\nWhile President Trump has largely, and loudly, focused his immigration policy on the border, his administration has quietly reshaped the country\u2019s legal flow of foreigners, including those seeking to travel, work or study in the United States. Work visas are being denied or delayed at high rates, companies have said. Colleges have worried about attracting international students who need visas. And foreigners already in the United States have found it more difficult to extend their stays.\nMs. Salem said she had worked on numerous similar requests in past years for family members who wanted to visit a sick relative or attend a funeral in the United States. She said she could not think of another case with similar circumstances that had been denied.\n\u201cHe has never attempted to come back to the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has no desire to come to the U.S. He wanted to kiss his daughter goodbye.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/hania-aguilar-father-visa-denied.html", "tags": [{"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.74384"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.35746"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.34906"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.32402"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.13673"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.10733"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.09890"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.09780"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.07417"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.06909"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.05711"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.04716"}, {"label": "illegal aliens", "score": "0.04367"}, {"label": "hostages", "score": "0.04327"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.03196"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.02790"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.02761"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.02742"}, {"label": "immigration and emigration", "score": "0.02642"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02360"}, {"label": "asylum (political)", "score": "0.02220"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.02209"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02136"}, {"label": "sex crimes", "score": "0.01576"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01519"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01425"}, {"label": "visas", "score": "0.01421"}, {"label": "mexico-international relations-us", "score": "0.01326"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.01325"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.01286"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["North Carolina", "the United States Embassy", "Guatemala City", "the United States", "Guatemala", "Texas", "North Carolina", "Guatemala", "Hania", "U.S.", "Guatemala", "the United States", "Hania", "Lumberton", "N.C.", "Fayetteville", "Hania", "Hania", "Hania", "Hania", "Lumberton", "Guatemala", "the United States", "the United States", "Guatemala", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "U.S.", "U.S."], "ORG": ["The State Department", "the State Department", "State Department", "The Department of State", "F.B.I.", "Adidas", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I."], "PERSON": ["Hania Aguilar", "Hania Aguilar", "No\u00e9 Aguilar", "Naimeh Salem", "Salem", "Aguilar", "Roy Cooper", "Salem", "Mark Meadows", "Salem", "Cooper", "Luis E.

And the worries don\u2019t stop there.\nMs. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.\nImagine, if you will (and you should), a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing.\nThat is exactly what a number of Silicon Valley executives told me they are concerned about after the arrest this week of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecom company Huawei, in Canada at the behest of United States officials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worrisome, because it\u2019s an escalation we did not need,\u201d one executive said, referring to the already tense trade talks between the two countries. \u201cWhat China will do, given all the existing tensions, is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d\n[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]\nNo one I spoke to would talk on the record, out of fear of antagonizing either side and also because no one knows exactly what is happening. But many expressed worry about the possibility of tit-for-tat arrests.\nWhile everyone focuses on the drama of the arrest \u2014 Ms. Meng was grabbed while changing planes at the airport \u2014 and its effect on the trade talks and stock prices, to my mind there is a much more important fight brewing, and it is about tech hegemony. Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?\nUntil recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.\nThat hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.\nThe arrest of Ms. Meng isn\u2019t the first time the United States has cracked down on Chinese companies. This year the No. 2 Chinese telecom maker, ZTE, was slapped with a $1 billion fine for violating trade rules, and the Singapore-based Broadcom was blocked from buying the San Diego-based Qualcomm.\nBut the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.\nThe Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government.\nAll this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play.\nThe government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.\nBut I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race.\nOur government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).\nThis week, the White House released a five-year plan around STEM education \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 that is not nearly robust enough to make the Chinese even slightly nervous that we can keep up with their decidedly more aggressive efforts to train their work force for the next era of computing.\nAlso this week in the White House, a round-table was held to debate topics like artificial intelligence, 5G wireless and quantum computing, with top tech executive such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Google, Safra Catz of Oracle and Steve Mollenkopf of Qualcomm in attendance. It was called a \u201clistening session,\u201d and it was reported that President Trump \u201cpopped\u201d in, at a time when these issues need far more sustained attention from the top than that.\nWhich is why it came as no surprise when The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump was not briefed about the planned arrest of Ms. Meng, even though it took place at the same time he was having dinner with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in an attempt to find a truce in the trade war.\nFrom where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.\nWhich is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\nKara Swisher, editor at large for the technology news website Recode and producer of the Recode Decode podcast and Code Conference, is a contributing opinion writer. @karaswisher \u2022 Facebook", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/opinion/huawei-meng-wanzhou-china-arrest.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.74166"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.31264"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.18210"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.16892"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.12453"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.09882"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.08734"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.08483"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.04005"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.03722"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.03588"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.03060"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.03055"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.02677"}, {"label": "stocks and bonds", "score": "0.02463"}, {"label": "blogs and blogging (internet)", "score": "0.02434"}, {"label": "executives and management", "score": "0.02411"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.01998"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01788"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01714"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01706"}, {"label": "multinational companies", "score": "0.01609"}, {"label": "china-international relations-us", "score": "0.01479"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.01362"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.01296"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01275"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.01263"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01260"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.01245"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01089"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["China", "China", "Beijing", "Canada", "United States", "China", "the United States", "China", "China", "the United States", "Singapore", "San Diego", "China", "Iran", "China", "the United States", "China", "the United States", "China", "the United States", "China", "Beijing"], "ORG": ["Tech", "Huawei", "Twitter", "ZTE", "Broadcom", "Qualcomm", "The Justice Department", "Huawei", "Huawei", "the People\u2019s Liberation Army", "Huawei", "Huawei", "the Office of Science and Technology Policy", "the White House", "the White House", "Microsoft", "Google", "Safra Catz", "Oracle", "Qualcomm", "The New York Times", "Cisco", "Apple", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": ["Meng Wanzhou", "Swisher", "Meng Wanzhou", "Kara Swisher", "Meng", "Trump", "Meng", "Meng", "Trump", "Meng", "Meng", "Ren Zhengfei", "Meng", "Trump", "Satya Nadella", "Sundar Pichai", "Steve Mollenkopf", "Trump", "Trump", "Meng", "Xi Jinping", "Kara Swisher"]}}, {"index": 17, "year": 2018, "title": "The N.F.L. Questioned Kareem Hunt, But Not About Cleveland", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/sports/football/kareem-hunt-nfl.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nThe N.F.L. Questioned Kareem Hunt, But Not About Cleveland\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Several weeks ago, investigators from the N.F.L. sat down for an interview with Kareem Hunt, the star Kansas City Chiefs running back who was released by the team last week over an assault on a young woman at a Cleveland hotel and apartment building in February.\nThe investigators wanted to ask Hunt about an allegation that he had punched a man in the face in June at a resort in Ohio, near where Hunt lives.\nYet the questioners did not ask about the Cleveland incident, which, after surveillance video surfaced last week showing assault, has renewed intense public discussion of the league\u2019s commitment to investigating and policing players\u2019 off-field violence.\nAlthough the N.F.L. said it had been unable to obtain the video, the celebrity news site TMZ did so and published it, showing Hunt shoving and kicking the woman, Abigail Ottinger, then a 19-year-old student at Kent State University, in a hotel hallway.\nNeither of the episodes \u2014 the attack on Ottinger or the incident with the man at a Lake Erie resort \u2014 resulted in criminal charges against Hunt, or discipline from the league. But the narrow scope of the investigators\u2019 recent questioning \u2014 at a time when the N.F.L. knew about the hotel attack but, it says, had not seen the video \u2014 points to the fits and starts of an N.F.L. inquiry that security experts who have worked with league say was less than rigorous and at times puzzling for a lack of a thoroughness.\nFour years after another damning surveillance video, of the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice punching out his fianc\u00e9e in a hotel elevator, blindsided the N.F.L., the Hunt incident also reveals how the league continues to struggle with challenges similar to those that plagued the Rice investigation. The former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller, whom the N.F.L. tapped to investigate its handling of the Rice matter, wrote in his report on that case that \u201cthe NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information\u201d about the episode.\nThe N.F.L. said its investigators had not spoken to Hunt about the hotel assault in February when they interviewed him this fall \u2014 in meetings than can sometimes last hours \u2014 because it was still gathering evidence.\nBut an examination of the investigation shows that the N.F.L. relied on the word of the Chiefs, who had a vested interest in keeping a star on the field, and did not press to independently verify the account of the incident that Hunt gave to them. Those actions have left the N.F.L. trying to explain another high-profile stumble in its stated effort to take seriously accusations that its players have behaved violently, especially in cases involving women.\nAn N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said in a statement that league investigators had had \u201cmultiple verbal conversations with Cleveland police officers and requested surveillance video immediately upon learning of the incident in February.\u201d The league\u2019s representatives also asked for any surveillance video from the Metropolitan at the 9, the upscale hotel and apartment complex where Hunt\u2019s attack on the woman occurred.\nThe management of the complex declined to turn over the video, the N.F.L. statement said. Yet the league did not seek to question Hunt about the suspected assault on Ottinger until after TMZ had published video of the incident last week.\nThis account of the N.F.L.\u2019s investigation is based on interviews with more than a dozen people, including team and league officials, law enforcement officials, witnesses to the incident and people with knowledge of the N.F.L.\u2019s security procedures. Most of these people requested anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the case.\nThe N.F.L. first learned about the incident at the 9 on Feb. 12, two days after it occurred, when a Cleveland police officer contacted Patrick Foran, the league\u2019s longtime security representative in Cleveland.\nThe league has a network of investigators in each city where its teams are located. These investigators, like Foran and an associate, James Davidson, are separate from the investigators employed by each team. The N.F.L. does its own investigations because teams often have an incentive to protect their players.\n\u201cThe team has their goal, which is to keep the player on the field, while the league wants to protect its brand,\u201d one former team security officer said.\nOver the next few days, Foran and Davidson obtained the police incident report and sent it to the league office in New York.\nThe Cleveland police said this week that they had begun an internal investigation to determine how and why a department employee provided the report to the league seemingly without going through official channels.\nOnce the league had the report, N.F.L. officials in New York then told Foran and Davidson to find out whether the 9 had video of the incident and, if so, to request it. But the 9 declined to turn over any video. Tony Quintal, an executive at the company that manages the 9, cited a company policy under which surveillance footage is given only to the police. Quintal said the league had never asked to interview any employees of the complex who had been working that night.\nN.F.L. security representatives also tried to obtain surveillance video from the police, the league said, but the police did not have it. No one had major injuries, and the police had classified the incident as a misdemeanor assault, not serious enough for an officer to attempt to obtain the video.\nCooperation from the local police with the N.F.L. and its teams varies by jurisdiction, but in general, the police are eager to help the league. It is not uncommon for a team security officer to receive a call from a local police officer about a player\u2019s transgression, a former team security officer said. Often, he said, a team security officer will pick up the player from the police station, and no charges will be filed.\nIn the case of Hunt, the N.F.L. conducted preliminary interviews with witnesses in February, but little appears to have happened between the initial efforts in February and this summer, when investigators from the N.F.L. reached out again to people involved in the February incident. Those calls might have been spurred by a new allegation against Hunt: that he had punched a man on June 3, in the island village of Put-in-Bay, Ohio, at the Bay Lodging Resort.\nThe N.F.L. declined to comment on the interviews about the June incident.\nOn Monday, TMZ reported that Hunt had also been named in a police report after an attack at a nightclub in Kansas City, Mo., in January, when a man said that Hunt and a number of other people had beaten him. Hunt was not charged; in fact, no arrests were made. A spokesman for the Kansas City Police Department, Sgt. Jake Becchina, said the N.F.L. had never contacted him about the January incident.\nOne witness to the incident in February in Cleveland said a league security official had called him during the summer. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he did not remember the name or the title of the person he spoke to. He said the investigator had asked him typical questions about what transpired that night and about what he had seen.\nThe person said the investigator had told him that the league had talked to other witnesses but that Ottinger and a friend who was also there that night had not been interviewed.\nThe league also asked the Chiefs what they had learned.\nThe investigation remained open because the league was still hoping to speak with other witnesses, according to a person familiar with the league\u2019s inquiry. The N.F.L. preferred to have everything in hand before approaching Hunt, though former security officials said that was not always how the league operates.\nOne possible reason that TMZ was able to obtain videos when the league did not is that TMZ pays for them. TMZ reportedly paid almost $90,000 for the elevator video of the Ravens\u2019 Rice punching his fianc\u00e9e in the head. TMZ did not respond to a request for comment on how it had obtained the surveillance video from the 9.\nHunt\u2019s agent, Dan Saffron, did not respond to multiple calls and emails requesting comment about his client and the investigation. Ottinger did not respond to emails or a message left at her parents\u2019 house outside Cleveland, and attempts to contact her through family members were unsuccessful. Other witnesses named in the police reports about the incident either declined to comment or did not respond to numerous messages.\nThe N.F.L.\u2019s investigators made their first formal efforts to speak with Hunt directly in late summer, when it contacted the Players Association to request a meeting with him about the incident in June. Approaching the Players Association is part of the league\u2019s investigative protocol; it allows the player to be accompanied to an inquiry by a union representative.\nThat interview finally occurred this fall, before the release of the video that showed Hunt kicking Ottinger as she lay on the ground in the hallway at the 9, but events of that night were not discussed, according to people with knowledge of the interview.\nDan Williams, a spokesman for the city prosecutor\u2019s office in Cleveland, declined to say whether prosecutors were pursuing the case or anticipated bringing charges. He also would not say whether Ottinger had asked to press charges or whether prosecutors had spoken to her or to Hunt.\nAs for Hunt, he cleared waivers after the Chiefs released him, and no team has claimed him. He is on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list, meaning he is ineligible to play even if he is signed, and still faces a potential suspension for violating the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\nKevin Draper reported from Cleveland, and Ken Belson from New York.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/sports/football/kareem-hunt-nfl.html", "tags": [{"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.22098"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.16479"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.13998"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.08481"}, {"label": "games", "score": "0.08144"}, {"label": "violence", "score": "0.06644"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.05780"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.05577"}, {"label": "assaults", "score": "0.04711"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.04046"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.03979"}, {"label": "colleges and universities", "score": "0.03381"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.02683"}, {"label": "sex crimes", "score": "0.02667"}, {"label": "basketball", "score": "0.02635"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.02556"}, {"label": "athletics and sports", "score": "0.02205"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.01916"}, {"label": "football", "score": "0.01882"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.01713"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.01651"}, {"label": "animals", "score": "0.01367"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01186"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00969"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.00839"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00809"}, {"label": "blacks (in us)", "score": "0.00771"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.00769"}, {"label": "firearms", "score": "0.00735"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.00720"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Cleveland", "CLEVELAND", "Kansas City", "Cleveland", "Ohio", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "New York", "Cleveland", "New York", "Ohio", "Kansas City", "Mo.", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "Cleveland", "New York"], "ORG": ["N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "TMZ", "Kent State University", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "Baltimore Ravens", "N.F.L.", "F.B.I.", "N.F.L.", "NFL", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "TMZ", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "Quintal", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "TMZ", "the Kansas City Police Department", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "TMZ", "TMZ", "TMZ", "Ravens", "TMZ", "N.F.L.", "the Players Association", "the Players Association"], "PERSON": ["Kareem Hunt", "Kareem Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Abigail Ottinger", "Hunt", "Ray Rice", "Hunt", "Rice", "Robert Mueller", "Rice", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Brian McCarthy", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Patrick Foran", "Foran", "James Davidson", "Foran", "Davidson", "Foran", "Davidson", "Tony Quintal", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Jake Becchina", "Hunt", "Rice", "Hunt", "Dan Saffron", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Dan Williams", "Hunt", "Hunt", "Kevin Draper", "Ken Belson"]}}, {"index": 18, "year": 2018, "title": "Orbiting, Another Thing for Online Daters to Worry About", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/style/orbiting-dating.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nOrbiting, Another Thing for Online Daters to Worry About\nDigitally observing a prospective love interest, or an ex, online is yet another way that people are confusing each other romantically.\nIf you\u2019ve dated in the age of social media \u2014 particularly now that you\u2019ve pivoted from posting the occasional status update to running 24/7 multiplatform documentaries of your existence \u2014 chances are you\u2019ve been watched, liked and followed by a crush, a lover or an ex.\nPrying eyes on Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter can be exciting when they come from a prospective romantic partner, confusing when unrequited and infuriating when the looker is an ex. In the last case, it\u2019s as though the specter of a Relationship That Could Have Been is peeping over your shoulder, keeping tabs without having to commit to any real-world interactions.\nNaturally, there is a name for this 21st-century phenomenon, which has joined ghosting, Netflix and chill, breadcrumbing and other recent entries to the dating lexicon. It\u2019s called orbiting.\nUnlike ghosting, which is a fancy word for disappearing from a lover\u2019s life without notice, orbiting could not have existed before the dawn of social media. It is a behavior bound to the medium, and to an age in which people can be hyper-connected without ever speaking. Distant methods of digital observation \u2014 likes, views, etc. \u2014 are what binds the orbiter and the orbited. The phrase has been floating in the social stratosphere for at least a year now: It cropped up in a Youtube video in November 2017, with a slightly different definition, and this April, was defined in its current form by Anna Iovine in an article for Manrepeller.\nThe way it feels to be orbited depends on your relationship to the orbiter. When you\u2019re interested in the satellite entity watching your social media activity, orbiting brings an endorphin rush, the feeling of being circled by someone you want to get closer to.\nBut when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad. There\u2019s the frustration of wondering why an ex would rather watch your life than be part of it. There\u2019s the disappointment when someone who has been orbiting for some time never does get any closer. And there\u2019s acceptance of the hard truth of all digital romance: Eventually the relationship must be taken offline, or brought to an end.\nKristine Mahan, 23, of Denver, came to experience orbiting after a \u201cpainfully digital\u201d seven-months-long relationship with someone who lived in Minnesota while she lived in Boston. One day, not two weeks after they had last visited each other, he stopped responding to texts and Snapchats all at once and without warning, as if the past several months had been simply deleted.\n\u201cOne thing he didn\u2019t stop doing, though, was watching my Stories and liking photos on Instagram,\u201d Ms. Mahan said. At first she felt hurt by the silence and confused by her ex\u2019s sustained surveillance of her online life. But after some time, Ms. Mahan came to see the behavior as a form of contact. \u201cI felt the urge to send subliminal messages via my Instagram Stories, knowing that was the only way I could communicate with him,\u201d she said.\nIan Coon, 21, of Des Moines, ditched Snapchat altogether, in part because of the number of former friends and dates who were orbiting his account. When he met his current boyfriend, he said, \u201cif I cared enough to get to know him, I had to text or FaceTime or \u2014 gasp \u2014 go on a date.\u201d\nSometimes, orbiting is so inexplicable that it just feels rude. Alexi Mojsejenko, 22 and living in New York, believes there\u2019s someone from her past who views her Stories to spite her, but withholds likes and comments on her Instagram posts.\n\u201cOrbiting, in this sense, just feels very passive aggressive,\u201d Ms. Mojsejenko said, \u201clike a silent and lonely battle.\u201d\nKate, a 27-year-old living in Colorado, took a more positive view. She says that orbiting has become a form of flirting for many people.\n\u201cThe bold ones will go far and like things from way back, which is definitely saying something,\u201d she said, referencing posts on her Instagram account. \u201cOr they are just clumsy and accidentally showed they stalked.\u201d\nShe said that orbiters avoid liking family photos or scenic pictures. Liking selfies, on the other hand, is an optimal way to orbit someone without acknowledging their existence offline.\nIt should also be said that orbiting isn\u2019t always intentional. Instagram Stories stream seamlessly into one another (and ads), so it\u2019s possible to view someone\u2019s day-to-day updates by accident, without ever digging deeper into their posting history.\nRegardless, it\u2019s a fact that dating is confusing, and orbiting can make that worse. Small online behaviors are infinitely interpretable, making it impossible to understand where you and another person stand. The lurking of a potential connection makes you wonder whether they\u2019ll ever materialize in person. And the orbiting ex only serves to keep you mired in a shadow version of the relationship, wondering, each time he or she views one of your Stories, what happened or what could have been.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/style/orbiting-dating.html", "tags": [{"label": "dating (social)", "score": "0.74684"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.72093"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.39096"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.09074"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.04650"}, {"label": "blogs and blogging (internet)", "score": "0.04111"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.03259"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02569"}, {"label": "space", "score": "0.01954"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.01666"}, {"label": "families and family life", "score": "0.01373"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01346"}, {"label": "friendship", "score": "0.01317"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01087"}, {"label": "sex", "score": "0.01062"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01056"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01003"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.00857"}, {"label": "love (emotion)", "score": "0.00853"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.00846"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.00763"}, {"label": "names, personal", "score": "0.00741"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00687"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00687"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00676"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.00594"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.00577"}, {"label": "names, organizational", "score": "0.00539"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.00531"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.00527"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Denver", "Minnesota", "Boston", "Des Moines", "New York", "Colorado"], "ORG": ["Snapchat", "Twitter", "Netflix", "Instagram", "Instagram Stories", "Snapchat", "Instagram", "Instagram", "Instagram Stories"], "PERSON": ["Instagram", "Anna Iovine", "Manrepeller", "Kristine Mahan", "Mahan", "Mahan", "Ian Coon", "Alexi Mojsejenko", "Mojsejenko", "Kate"]}}, {"index": 19, "year": 2018, "title": "The Week in Tech: Facebook Is in the News.

Again.\nEach week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\nGreetings, friends. I\u2019m Brian X. Chen, a tech columnist, meaning my job is to obsess over tech news so you don\u2019t have to. So here\u2019s the CliffsNotes version of the week in tech.\nI remember a time when tech companies were desperate to be in the news. Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company\u2019s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading.\nSo I bet Facebook wishes it could be out of the news cycle, even briefly. This week, a British parliamentary committee released confidential Facebook emails and documents as part of its investigation into online misinformation. And they did not make Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social networking empire look good.\nThe documents revealed how Facebook treated user data as a bargaining chip. The social network had a \u201cwhite list\u201d agreement with companies it favored, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix. The arrangement involved sharing user data with those parties that other companies were restricted from obtaining.\nThe revelations paint Facebook as if it were the head of an internet syndicate with the mission of making money and crushing competition. That\u2019s a terrible image at a time that Facebook is trying to win back people\u2019s trust by saying its true mission is to connect people with people. In a nondenial statement, Facebook said it never sold people\u2019s data.\nNone of the bad publicity is lost on Facebook employees, as it appears to be affecting morale. BuzzFeed reported that Facebook had divided into three camps: people on Team Zuckerberg, people who believe the press is creating biased narratives, and a group that believes the scandals show that the company is on the brink of a meltdown.\nIncidentally, Glassdoor, a site where people can anonymously rank their employers, released a report this week that found Facebook was the No. 7 place to work of 2018, down from No. 1 last year. (Morale dip aside, that\u2019s still a great overall ranking; I think people just love having Philz Coffee on campus.)\n\u25a0 At least Facebook isn\u2019t alone in hot water. Last Friday (because companies like to save their bad news for weekends) Marriott International revealed that hackers had breached its Starwood reservation system and had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests.\nThe stolen data included names, addresses and encrypted credit card details of hotel customers. Hackers also stole travel histories and passport numbers of a smaller group of guests. It\u2019s one of the bigger cybersecurity breaches in history. (Then again, the Facebook breach affecting 30 million accounts, announced last September, was nothing to sneeze at.)\n\u25a0 Another company having a bad news week: Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and daughter of the company founder, was arrested last week in Canada at the request of the United States, in a move that will certainly increase tensions between the two countries.\nCanada\u2019s Justice Department said she was sought for extradition to the United States but did not give a reason. The United States government has long expressed concern about Huawei\u2019s surveillance capabilities because of the company\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government.\n\u2022 O.K., O.K., I\u2019ll lighten things up. I wrote a column this week about how I tried to turn my food-obsessed dog, Max, into an Instagram celebrity \u2014 and failed. I tried everything: kissing up to influencers, getting professional consultations and even buying bots, but no dice. Here\u2019s what I learned about the brutal space that is Instagram.\n\u2022 I love New York Times crossword puzzles, and I know many of you do, too. So it was a delight to hear from Sam Ezersky, an assistant editor of puzzles, about the tech tools uses to create the crosswords as well as how puzzle-solving has changed in the smartphone era.\n\u2022 This week there\u2019s been some buzz around 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network from cellular carriers, meaning a faster cellular connection might be closer to reality.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon Wireless announced they would support a yet-to-be-named 5G phone from Samsung next year. The 5G network will theoretically be so fast that people will be able to download movies in seconds. (I\u2019ll believe it when I see it \u2014 I still struggle to get a good 4G LTE signal in San Francisco.)\nBrian X. Chen is the lead consumer technology writer.

At the core of their questions was a concern over the company\u2019s commitment to free expression.\n\u201cAll of these topics \u2014 competition, censorship, bias and others \u2014 point to one fundamental question that demands the nation\u2019s attention,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d\n\u201cBecause a free world depends on a free internet, we need to know that Google is on the side of the free world,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\nRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, highlighted the importance of scrutinizing Google because of the company\u2019s market power in search, cloud-based email and its Android mobile operating system.\nMr. Goodlatte also raised concerns that the liberal-leaning political biases of employees may also affect filtering decisions for its search engine. He mentioned a leaked video the day after the 2016 presidential election showing top officials lamenting the victory of President Trump.\n\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201d\nMr. McCarthy is among several Republican members who have made online political bias a talking point in campaign fund-raisers. Claims of anti-conservative bias within the technology of Google, Facebook and Twitter have been disputed by numerous technologists and academics.\nDemocrats had their own set of tough questions for Mr. Pichai on privacy and the company\u2019s competitive practices. But they also expressed frustration with the political bias claims.\n\u201cI must dispense with the complete illegitimate fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other platforms have anti-conservative bias,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee.\nPraise for Google as Well\nOfficials were expected to be merciless for Mr. Pichai\u2019s first appearance before Congress. When he declined to appear in a Senate hearing in September, lawmakers called the act \u201carrogant,\u201d and they put out an empty chair in his absence.\nThough lawmakers asked Mr. Pichai a variety of pointed questions, they also lauded Google as an American icon.\n\u201cYour company should really be held out as a success story of America\u2019s free enterprise system,\u201d said Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cDespite the nature and scope of today\u2019s hearing, Google is still the story of the American dream,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said.\n\u201cWe do not want to impose burdensome regulations on your industry,\u201d said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.\nGoing into a third hour of the hearing, Republicans offered little detail on how they would follow up on concerns about privacy and anti-conservative bias.\nDemocrats, in large part, defended the company of political bias claims.\nRepresentative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, said negative news coverage of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, were perhaps the result of his views on immigration.\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself,\u201d Mr. Lieu said.\nLocation, Location, Location\nDuring Mr. Pichai\u2019s testimony, the first question from Mr. Goodlatte was about whether consumers understand the frequency and amount of location data that Google collects from its Android operating system.\nIt was the first of many questions directed at Mr. Pichai about the collection of location data and apps that run on Android smartphones, some citing an investigation by The New York Times. Mr. Pichai said repeatedly that Google offers users controls for limiting location data collection and that it did not sell user data, carefully avoiding the question of how the company uses such data in the practice of selling advertising.\nThe sharpest exchange came when Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.\nMr. Pichai said, \u201cnot by default,\u201d adding that it depended on the congressman\u2019s settings on the apps he had installed. But when Mr. Pichai would not respond yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and said Mr. Pichai appeared to be evading his question.\n\u201cYou make $100 million a year,\u201d he said to Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in the technology industry. \u201cYou should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201d\nTaking On Google\nBefore the hearing, Google\u2019s critics drew attention to their grievances against the company that became fodder for lawmakers.\nA group of employees, who organized a walkout of 20,000 workers from the company\u2019s offices last month over its harassment and discrimination policies, released a letter stating that Google\u2019s concessions to the protests were not enough and that it planned to push for the end of mandatory arbitration in all cases and for all employees, including temporary and contract staff. The protests were prompted by an article in The New York Times in October revealing that Google had paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of misconduct, while staying silent about the transgressions.\n\u201cBut just as Google wants to convince the public that it can handle consumer privacy matters behind closed doors,\u201d the employee group wrote, \u201cit tells the same to its employees by forcing arbitration, requiring them to waive their right to sue or participate in a class-action lawsuit in all cases of discrimination.\u201d\nSeparately, more than 50 human rights organizations signed a letter to Mr. Pichai demanding that the company stop working on Project Dragonfly, the initiative within Google to build a censored search engine that it may use in the Chinese market. A search engine that restricts content banned by the Chinese government is \u201ctroubling,\u201d the groups said, because it would contribute to repressive censorship and surveillance.\nProblems at Google Plus\nGoogle has eight products with more than one billion monthly users, including search, YouTube and Google Drive, its suite of productivity apps. But a product that has struggled to amass users provided fodder for questions from lawmakers about Google\u2019s handling of user data.\nGoogle announced on Monday that it found a security vulnerability last month in Google Plus, the company\u2019s answer to Facebook. The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed.

Its use is also growing in the entertainment realm: Madison Square Garden is among the venues employing it.\nThe Swift security team\u2019s reported use of facial recognition, however, could represent a new tactic: luring people to step in front of the camera, rather than just scanning a crowd or waiting for fans to pass by.

Want this by email? Sign up here.\nAs China softens on trade, U.S. plays hardball ...\nThe Trump administration, believing Beijing will struggle to change its trade stance, plans to hammer home the idea that it is interested only in strong commitments.\nChina has begun to make good on some concessions. Beijing has reportedly agreed to cut tariffs on imported American cars to 15 percent from 40 percent (although that might not be as significant as it sounds). China also is said to be planning to increase its purchases of U.S. crops.\nBut the administration is wary. Exhibit A is the revelation that the U.S. authorities have traced the recent data breach at Marriott to Chinese hackers. Government officials that spoke to the NYT said the finding \u201cadded urgency\u201d to administration concerns that the trade truce may do little to change Beijing\u2019s behavior. Among those concerns: the potential for the continuing coercion of American companies to hand over valuable technology if they seek to enter the Chinese market and theft of industrial secrets.\nWashington plans to ratchet up the pressure. That could include the indictment of Chinese hackers, the declassification of intelligence reports describing information-gathering practices, and an executive order that would make it harder for Chinese companies to obtain critical components for telecommunications equipment. (There probably won\u2019t be an indictment over the Marriott hacking.)\n\u2026 and the Huawei arrest could become even more important\nThe events surrounding the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of Chinese tech giant Huawei, could figure into the trade fight.\nThe latest: Ms. Meng was released on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars (about $7.5 million). And after threatening Canada with \u201cserious consequences\u201d over the arrest, China has detained the former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig.\nPresident Trump could get involved. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he would consider intervening in Ms. Meng\u2019s case if doing so would serve national security interests or increase the likelihood of a trade deal.\nThat runs counter to the view of the U.S. trade representative. Robert Lighthizer said this week that Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was \u201ctotally separate\u201d from his work and that it \u201cshouldn\u2019t really have much of an impact\u201d on trade talks. (An intervention would also pit Mr. Trump against his own Justice Department, which coordinated with Canada on the arrest.)\nTheresa May faces a leadership challenge today\nThe persistent dissatisfaction with the way Prime Minister Theresa May has handled Britain\u2019s looming withdrawal from the E.U. has given way to a no-confidence vote over her role as leader of the Conservative Party.\nWhat happened: The contest was triggered when 48 Tory lawmakers submitted letters of protest. The vote is to take place this evening.\nHow it works: \u201cUnder the party\u2019s rules, Mrs. May needs to win 158 votes from among the 315 Conservative members of Parliament to stay as party leader and therefore prime minister,\u201d writes Stephen Castle of the NYT. \u201cIf she does so, then party members cannot mount another challenge to her leadership for a year, but if she loses the vote, then she withdraws and another leader will be chosen over the coming weeks.\u201d\nWhy it matters: Britain is struggling to find a route that maintains useful political and economic ties with the E.U. without causing economic disaster, and Mrs. May\u2019s decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her withdrawal plan has plunged the country into greater uncertainty. If she were to be ousted, Britain could be temporarily rudderless at a time of huge political importance.\nComing Up: Tencent Music goes public\nThe Chinese music-streaming company makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange this morning.\nThe news: Tencent Music priced its I.P.O. at $13 a share, raising close to $1.1 billion. At that price, the company is valued at $21 billion. It had originally sought a valuation of $25 billion to $30 billion.\nThe context: Tencent Music filed to go public in early October, but delayed its offering as the stock market experienced a huge sell-off. Market conditions have not improved, and shares of Spotify, Tencent Music\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, are down 30 percent since early October.\nWhy it matters: Airbnb, Lyft, Palantir, Slack and Uber are all expected to go public in 2019. Tencent Music\u2019s I.P.O. could provide an early signal of how volatile markets will receive major tech offerings.\nWhat we learned (and didn\u2019t) when Mr. Pichai went to Washington\nGoogle\u2019s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, took his turn for a congressional grilling. It followed the well-worn pattern established by other tech hearings this year: Lawmakers ask predictable (and, occasionally, ill-informed) questions, and C.E.O.s repeat company lines.\nMr. Pichai mostly followed that script. The Google chief said the company did not suppress conservative views, adding that its \u201calgorithms have no notion of political sentiment.\u201d He deflected questions about privacy by discussing the controls available to users. And Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican, asked why his granddaughter\u2019s iPhone, a device made by a Google competitor, was acting strangely.\nThe company\u2019s China play became more confusing. Mr. Pichai said Google had \u201cno plans to launch a search service in China.\u201d The Intercept noted that, when asked whether Google would introduce \u201ca tool for surveillance and censorship in China,\u201d he declined to answer. Later, in an interview with the WaPo, Mr. Pichai appeared to broaden his options. \u201cCan we explore and serve users in China, in areas like education and health care?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand a market.\u201d\nIt may be time for a shake-up. \u201cThis three-and-half-hour hearing was not as worthwhile as it should have been for Congress, the company and the public,\u201d writes Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion. \u201cWhat if, instead of accusations, members of Congress and Google offered solutions?\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s charm offensive\nAmazon is trying to quell rising opposition to its plan for New York offices by hiring lobbyists, reports J. David Goodman of the NYT:\n\u2022 Critics object to the lack of a public review, the potential impact on low-income areas and, most of all, the incentives that could total $3 billion.\n\u2022 Amazon has hired two former city councilmen \u2014 Mark Weprin and Ed Wallace \u2014 to make its case.\n\u2022 Company executives have set up shop in a hotel in Long Island City, the neighborhood where Amazon plans to build a new campus. They have been walking the streets, sometimes accompanied by city officials, to sound out residents.\n\u2022 Opponents can ratchet up the rhetoric, but the deal does not need City Council approval.\nDespite everything, the markets are calm\nGlobal markets were calm and mostly in positive territory today despite the threat of a government shutdown in the United States, potential trouble for U.S.-China trade talks and accelerating political chaos in Britain.\nThere\u2019s one big exception: The pound whipsawed after Conservative lawmakers announced the no-confidence vote, initially dropping below $1.248 before edging up to near $1.255. (The FTSE 100 was up 0.4 percent in early trading.)\nCan a Michigan accelerator spin up Midwestern start-ups?\nRemember how a dozen or so venture capitalists hopped on to a bus for a three-day tour of the Midwest? The idea was for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start-ups in overlooked parts of the country.\nIt seems to have had some effect. A new accelerator group, 100K Ventures, announced today that it planned to invest in early-stage companies in Flint, Mich. Created by the 32 Ventures founder Robert Wolf in partnership with Phil Hagerman, the founder of the investment firm Skypoint Ventures in Flint, the organization hopes to demonstrate that investing in underserved American communities makes enough sense to expand the scheme nationally.\nAmong the investors in 100K Ventures: the N.B.A. player Draymond Green, the minority owner of the Philadelphia Eagles Christina Weiss Lurie, the former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter, the Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, and the journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien.\nFortune 500 companies aren\u2019t great with email security\nA new study by the cybersecurity company Rapid7 peers into the digital defenses of Fortune 500 companies, with two big tests yielding mixed results.\n\u2022 About 330 companies were found to have weak or nonexistent email defenses to prevent phishing attacks that seek to gather personal information.\n\u2022 On average, the companies each exposed 500 servers or devices to potential hackers. That may sound like a lot, but Tod Beardsley of Rapid7 told Axios that it was \u201clower than I was expecting\u201d given the size of the companies.\nThe bottom line: \u201cCybersecurity basics are being missed or insufficiently deployed even among very large, mature, and well-resourced organizations,\u201d Rapid7 concluded.\nRevolving door\nThe food and agriculture company Bunge ousted its C.E.O., Soren Schroder, and chairman, Patrick Lupo. Mr. Schroder will remain in place until a successor is found. (FT)\nKathie Lee Gifford is to leave NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d in April.

(TechCrunch)\n\u2022 SoftBank reportedly plans to shed its stake in Nvidia next year. (Bloomberg)\nPolitics and policy\n\u2022 President Trump met with Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and vowed to shut down the federal government if they refused to approve financing for his proposed border wall. Ms. Pelosi later called the project \u201ca manhood thing.\u201d\n\u2022 John Kelly\u2019s departure as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff may be part of a larger shake-up. The president said he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to replace Mr. Kelly.\n\u2022 Some Democrats considering a presidential run may forgo or disavow money from super PACs. (NYT)\n\u2022 The E.U. hoped to put its house in order this year. That didn\u2019t work. (NYT)\n\u2022 Mr. Trump called payments to two women to keep them about quiet about sexual relationships they said they had with him \u201ca simple private transaction.\u201d (NYT)\n\u2022 One of those women, Stormy Daniels, has been ordered to pay Mr. Trump $292,000 in legal fees. (Bloomberg)\nTech\n\u2022 Super Micro, which Bloomberg claims had Chinese spy chips installed on its hardware, said it had found no evidence of such devices. (Reuters)\n\u2022 Mobile ad tech is struggling. TV ad tech, on the other hand, appears to be having a moment. (Axios)\n\u2022 A Facebook building in Menlo Park was evacuated after a bomb threat. No explosive device was found. (Bloomberg)\nBest of the rest\n\u2022 Verizon booked a $4.5 billion accounting charge related to its Oath online media business. (WSJ)\n\u2022 The CBS board didn\u2019t mention Les Moonves at its annual meeting. Separately, the company settled with three women who accused it of not doing enough to stop Charlie Rose from sexually harassing them.\n\u2022 President Trump said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d of the Fed to continue raising interest rates. But tepid inflation could allow the Fed to slow them.\n\u2022 Malaysian prosecutors issued new corruption charges against the former prime minister Najib Razak and the former C.E.O. of 1MDB. (Reuters)\n\u2022 A Tokyo court rejected Carlos Ghosn\u2019s appeal to be released from detention. Nissan has shared the allegations made against Mr. Ghosn with Renault, suggesting that relations between the two companies are improving.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s what the first steak grown in a lab tastes like.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.\nDavid Byrne, \u2018Everybody\u2019s Coming to My House\u2019\nDavid Byrne\u2019s 2018 tour put his whole band in choreographed motion, a spectacle that rivaled the Talking Heads\u2019 1983 extravaganza filmed as \u201cStop Making Sense.\u201d One rave review \u2014 \u201c\u2018 \u2026 The Best Live Show of All Time\u2019 \u2014 NME\u201d \u2014 supplies the title for an EP recorded live in Brooklyn. Even without visuals, \u201cEverybody\u2019s Coming to My House\u201d sheds the nervous, paranoid overtone of the studio version on Byrne\u2019s 2018 album, \u201cAmerican Utopia.\u201d While the lyrics envision ceaseless surveillance and interaction, the sheer funkiness makes it sound like one big house party. JON PARELES\nAmerican Football, \u2018Silhouettes\u2019\nAn arrestingly beautiful lead single from the forthcoming third album by American Football, lonely titans of 1990s emo. Mike Kinsella sings like a nudge, a suggestion: \u201cWhat\u2019s the allure of inconsequential love?\u201d he wonders, at a low enough volume that you know he doesn\u2019t know the answer. All around him, bells peal and guitars swarm and the song gets tense, but only in an internal way. From the outside, there\u2019s no sweat at all. JON CARAMANICA\nRobin Thicke, \u2018Testify\u2019\nIt\u2019s been a challenging \u2026 five(?) years for Robin Thicke: that Miley performance, the dissolution of his marriage, the death of his father, the crumbling of his claim to celebrity. Just this week, he was ordered to pay restitution to the family of Marvin Gaye as part of the final resolution of the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit that accused him and Pharrell Williams of pilfering the key elements of that song from Gaye\u2019s \u201cGot to Give It Up.\u201d After all that, a retreat from the spotlight for good would be understandable, and perhaps advisable. But now comes \u201cTestify\u201d: gentle, self-lacerating, studiously vulnerable. A rather lovely acoustic guitar ballad \u2014 one that moves him toward adult-contemporary R&B, a natural new home \u2014 \u201cTestify\u201d is essentially a litany of failures, shortcomings, disappointments. He lists them sweetly, not defiantly. They are who he is now. These are his confessions. CARAMANICA\nAvril Lavigne, \u2018Tell Me It\u2019s Over\u2019\n\u201cTell Me It\u2019s Over\u201d is a nearly pure retro move for Avril Lavigne. It\u2019s a can\u2019t-leave-you song \u2014 \u201cEvery time you touch me/I forget what we\u2019re fighting about\u201d \u2014 that harks back to early 1960s soul and girl groups, with a slow-rolling 12/8 beat, wall-of-sound orchestration and a fully belted chorus. The 21st-century tipoff, and spoiler, is the ratchety trap high-hat sound that\u2019s likely to make it sound dated rather than classic. PARELES\nEgo Ella May, \u2018Table for One\u2019\nNot to be confused with Ella Mai, Ego Ella May is a singer and songwriter from London who\u2019s on the jazzy side of the neo-soul spectrum, with a fine-line soprano and a penchant for zigzag chromatic melodies. In \u201cTable for One,\u201d she works through the loneliness and disorientation of a breakup \u2014 \u201cI try to reprogram my mind/there\u2019s no change\u201d \u2014 to eventually decide \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all/I\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u201d Her backup band is live and improvisational in the studio, suddenly stirring up gusty, slightly cluttered crescendos and then settling back down, turning the song into an unfinished narrative. PARELES\nTemptation, \u2018All Hail the Silence\u2019\nKnobs, keyboards, monochrome monitors galore. Analog synthesizer geeks should thrill to this video of \u201cAll Hail the Silence\u201d by the duo of the keyboardist and producer BT (Brian Transeau) and the singer and songwriter Christian Burns, whose mission is to record electronic pop without computers. This is the synthesizer version of recording with vintage guitars and tube amps; what once was futuristic now seems homey. PARELES\nFilmore, \u2018Heart\u2019s Having a Hard Time\u2019\nA sturdy and concise pop-soul number masking as a country song, \u201cHeart\u2019s Having a Hard Time\u201d is a sharp introduction to Filmore, a rising country singer with a voice that never flirts with tension. Instead, he\u2019s a gentle mope, peaceful in his resignation to hurt, even though his words capture a sadness that\u2019s potent and pained:\nIt shouldn\u2019t be so tough for me\nto change my lock screen\nbut it\u2019s sinking in\nthat I don\u2019t get to kiss that smile no more\nCARAMANICA\nJason Palmer, \u2018Moonlight Becomes You\u2019\nJason Palmer is one of the great, fine-tuned improvisers of his generation, but the 39-year-old trumpeter, who lives in Boston, remains underrecognized by the jazz public. His newest album, \u201cFair Weather,\u201d probably won\u2019t correct the issue: It\u2019s out on Newvelle Records, a label that operates entirely on a subscription model, requiring buyers to purchase a full year\u2019s worth of records in order to receive anything. But this video for the title track \u2014 a skating, five-beat retrofit of the old ballad \u201cMoonlight Becomes You\u201d \u2014 offers a sense of Palmer\u2019s powers: his way of quietly recasting the harmonies of a tune, and gently pulling a rhythm section together around him as he improvises. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\nYves Jarvis, \u2018Fruits of Disillusion\u2019\nThe Canadian songwriter Jean-Sebastian Audet released a 2017 album under the name Un Blonde; now he\u2019s recording as Yves Jarvis. The disorientation only begins there in \u201cFruits of Disillusion,\u201d a wispy, wavery, deliberately ambling three minutes of low-fi psychedelia. The track begins as a gentle drone with feedback woven in, offers a spoke-sung verse that suddenly sprouts harmonies and wanders off to an unsteady beat. It\u2019s a rumination on \u201cconstant change\u201d that\u2019s secure in its own fragility. PARELES\nKid Koala featuring Trixie Whitley, \u2018All for You\u2019\nThe DJ and producer Kid Koala dissolves the beat in the series of recordings he calls \u201cMusic to Draw To.\u201d His second installment is \u201cIo,\u201d based on the Greek myth of a mortal priestess who attracted the ardor of Zeus and the wrath of his wife, Hera. \u201cAll for You\u201d is a serenely awe-struck lullaby, with Trixie Whitley\u2019s hushed, hazy voice sounding just earthy enough amid shimmering, cyclical chords. PARELES\nCale Brandley with Triptych Myth, \u2018Sunset Park, After the Sun Sets\u2019\nTriptych Myth was a trio led by Cooper-Moore, a lion of the downtown music scene, in the early 2000s, when he\u2019d just ended a yearslong hiatus from playing the piano. \u201cFinding Fire,\u201d recorded in 2005 but not released until this week, is the band\u2019s third and ostensibly final album, and it is a continental statement: widely varied in terms of textures and tones, unfolding like an epic novel, with various stories converging into one. The album finds Triptych Myth \u2014 featuring Tom Abbs and bass and the ever-potent Chad Taylor on drums \u2014 in tender, slowly mutating dialogue with Cale Brandley, a reeds player and vocalist. On \u201cSunset Park, After the Sun Sets,\u201d Brandley starts on the ney, a Middle Eastern flute with a chalky tone, and moves to the alto clarinet, improvising in miniature filigrees and small, tumbling phrases as the trio creates a pebbly path below him.

It said that Israel\u2019s Military Advocate General was examining that failure.\nBut it defended the roof-knocking tactic, insisting it \u201ccoincides entirely with international law\u201d and had been proved \u201ccountless times\u201d to \u201creduce harm to civilians located in or near structures that are military objectives.\u201d\nAnd it denied any effort to distort news coverage of the attack on what Israel called an urban-warfare training center of Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.\nThe report was published as a video on Monday by B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, and Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group that investigates state violence and human rights violations.\nIt pinpointed the moment on July 14, during a daylong exchange of rockets and airstrikes between Israel and Gaza, when Amir al-Nimrah and Luai Kahil were killed: at 5:45 p.m., as they sat with their legs dangling over the edge of an unfinished tower overlooking Al Katiba Square, having just taken a selfie.\n(Amir was widely reported to be 15 years old and Luai a year older, but B\u2019Tselem said on Tuesday that it had obtained documents that put the age of both boys at 14.)\nIn an English-language publication during the 2014 war with Gaza, the Israeli military said it used \u201cloud but nonlethal\u201d bombs for roof-knocking.\nBut videos recorded in July by people who rushed to the rooftop to try to help the two boys showed pockmarks in the concrete surface that the report said matched the shrapnel pattern of an antipersonnel missile.\nThat would be consistent with the Israeli practice of using munitions for roof-knocking strikes that would explode on the surface of a building, rather than pierce it and endanger those inside.\nA government report on the 2014 Gaza war acknowledged that the tactic was \u201cimperfect,\u201d but said that it prevented many civilian deaths and injuries.\nThe boys, however, were seated only about 30 feet from where the missile struck, according to the report.\n\u201cWarning strikes are an essential part of the Israeli military\u2019s claims to high ethical standards,\u201d said Eyal Weizman, director of Forensic Architecture, which has also collaborated with The New York Times. \u201cBut such warnings are sometimes delivered with the same missiles that are used elsewhere to kill,\u201d he said.\nTo support its conclusion that the Israeli military had selectively chosen images used to publicize the attack, the report analyzed video posted online by the military spokesman\u2019s office.\nAll told, four roof-knocking strikes hit the building between 5:45 p.m. and 5:58 p.m., the report found. Four tremendous blasts then quickly destroyed it at 6:02 p.m.\nAbout an hour later, the Israel Defense Forces spokesman\u2019s office issued a Twitter post with a video of the attack, with clips of what looked like four roof-knocking strikes on the building followed by the major explosions. The two teenagers could not be seen on the roof in the first clip.\nBut the report found that the first roof-knocking strike, at 5:45 p.m., was actually missing from the military\u2019s Twitter post.\nIn its place was an additional angle on the third strike, at 5:54 p.m. \u2014 recorded after the boys\u2019 bodies had already been carried away by people who rushed to the roof to try to help them.\nThat prompted the human rights groups to ask whether the Israeli military had suppressed video that might have shown the boys on the roof when the first missile was fired \u2014 or whether it was incapable of conducting airstrikes in populated areas while still meeting its legal obligations to spare civilians.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the boys were visible to the military before the first strike,\u201d said Amit Gilutz, a B\u2019Tselem spokesman. \u201cIf so, they should have aborted. If not, that raises grave concerns as to the military\u2019s surveillance capabilities.\u201d\nThe military spokesman\u2019s office denied any attempt to manipulate coverage of the airstrike. It said that the first visual evidence the military had seen of the two teenagers\u2019 presence on the rooftop \u2014 despite a review conducted in response to news reports of their deaths \u2014 was in the video published on Monday by B\u2019Tselem and Forensic Architecture.\n\u201cAny allegations that the I.D.F. knowingly distorted or edited video footage are totally baseless and false,\u201d it said.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-roof-knocking.html", "tags": [{"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.92755"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.32694"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.27032"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.09472"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.09032"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.06412"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.06235"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.06176"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.06031"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.04691"}, {"label": "violence", "score": "0.04073"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.04025"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.03650"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.03372"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.02684"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.02425"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.02207"}, {"label": "missiles and missile defense systems", "score": "0.02162"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.01336"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.01234"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.01037"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00935"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00851"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.00797"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.00783"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.00779"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00637"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.00621"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.00606"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00600"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Gaza", "Israel", "Gaza City", "Israel", "Israel", "Gaza", "London", "Israel", "Gaza", "Gaza", "Gaza"], "ORG": ["the Israel Defense Forces\u2019", "the Israeli Air Force", "Hamas", "Forensic Architecture", "Forensic Architecture", "The New York Times", "the Israel Defense Forces", "B\u2019Tselem and Forensic Architecture", "I.D.F."], "PERSON": ["Amir al-Nimrah", "Luai Kahil", "Amir", "Luai", "Eyal Weizman", "Amit Gilutz"]}}, {"index": 27, "year": 2018, "title": "F.B.I.

Wiretap Recorded Suspect on Eve of Bike Path Terror Attack\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe Uzbek man charged with using a truck to kill eight people on a Manhattan bike path last year was recorded on an F.B.I. wiretap the day before the attack and was heard on other calls going back three years, according to two court filings by defense lawyers.\nThe filings do not reveal the contents of the conversations or whether the man, Sayfullo Saipov, 30, was overheard making threats or talking about an impending attack. Still, the filings suggested that Mr. Saipov was in touch with other people under F.B.I. surveillance.\nThe attack on Halloween last year was the deadliest terrorist attack in New York since Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Saipov is accused of driving a pickup truck down a bike path along the Hudson River, killing eight people and injuring others. He then crashed into a school bus, ran down the highway waving a pellet gun and a paintball gun and shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic.\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers said in court papers that they had received a trove of materials from the government concerning \u201csurreptitious F.B.I. surveillance of Mr. Saipov\u2019s communications.\u201d Those materials included \u201cnumerous audio recordings of conversations between Mr. Saipov and various targets of F.B.I. surveillance,\u201d along with about 1,000 pages of translated summaries of the calls, which were largely in Uzbek, the lawyers said.\nThe lawyers\u2019 filing left open the possibility that Mr. Saipov was not the actual target of F.B.I. surveillance and might have been overheard in conversations with others that the F.B.I. had interest in.\nMr. Saipov was apprehended after a police officer shot him in the abdomen and was charged with eight counts of murder and other crimes. Two F.B.I. agents questioned him through the night as he recovered in the intensive care unit at Bellevue Hospital Center.\nMr. Saipov told the agents he had been inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State videos that he had watched on his phone, according to a criminal complaint. He also said he began planning the attack about a year earlier and used a truck to inflict maximum damage. He told the agents \u201che felt good about what he had done,\u201d the complaint said.\nThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has not yet responded to the defense\u2019s filings. That office, the F.B.I. and Mr. Saipov\u2019s federal public defenders all declined to comment on the defense\u2019s new filings.\nTerrorism experts said the existence of such intercepted telephone calls \u2014 even where their content and significance are unknown \u2014 underscored the challenge for law enforcement in predicting so-called lone-wolf attacks. Little is known about Mr. Saipov\u2019s comments on the calls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the picture they paint of Saipov is just not that alarming,\u201d said Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and co-founder of Lawfare, a national security blog. \u201cBut it could turn out otherwise, and that would raise serious questions about why they didn\u2019t make him a priority, including the possibility of arresting him if grounds existed to do so.\u201d\nKaren J. Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law, said, \u201cThe question it raises in my mind is no matter how much surveillance there is, even right up to the eve of an attack, we still have not figured out exactly what it is that we\u2019re looking for as a sign of immediate danger beyond \u2018I have a gun in my pocket\u2019 or \u2018a bomb strapped to my chest.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers revealed the existence of the covert recordings as part of a request to the judge, Vernon S. Broderick, to suppress Mr. Saipov\u2019s statements after his arrest. They said prosecutors have told the defense that they do not intend to use the intercepted conversations during Mr. Saipov\u2019s trial or any potential death-penalty phase. But in reviewing the F.B.I.\u2019s summaries of Mr. Saipov\u2019s questioning, his lawyers wrote, \u201cit is clear they interrogated Mr. Saipov about matters and contacts that overlap\u201d with the covert surveillance of his communications.\nThe federal government has said it will seek the death penalty for Mr. Saipov if he is convicted at his trial, scheduled for next October in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Saipov was denounced immediately after the attack by President Trump, who wrote on Twitter that he \u201cshould get death penalty.\u201d\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers have asked Judge Broderick to block the government from seeking capital punishment, arguing the comments posted on Twitter and other statements by Mr. Trump had politicized the decision.\nFollow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter: BenWeiserNYT", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/nyregion/terror-attack-wiretap-saipov.html", "tags": [{"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.55055"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.48372"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.29316"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.23871"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.17157"}, {"label": "serial murders", "score": "0.16261"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.14645"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.13553"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.13147"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.11763"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.11406"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.10909"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.08794"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.07862"}, {"label": "holidays and special occasions", "score": "0.06204"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.05417"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.04419"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.04320"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.04298"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.04266"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.04018"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.02835"}, {"label": "pentagon building", "score": "0.02664"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.02293"}, {"label": "buses", "score": "0.02250"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02229"}, {"label": "firearms", "score": "0.02033"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01978"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.01974"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.01967"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "Manhattan", "New York", "United States", "Manhattan", "Saipov", "Manhattan"], "ORG": ["F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "Islamic State", "F.B.I.", "the University of Texas School of Law", "Lawfare", "the Center on National Security", "Fordham University School of Law", "F.B.I.", "Federal District Court", "Twitter"], "PERSON": ["Sayfullo Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Saipov", "Bobby Chesney", "Karen J.

The confidential plan, reviewed by The New York Times, would also deepen the cooperation between China and Pakistan in space, a frontier the Pentagon recently said Beijing was trying to militarize after decades of playing catch-up.\nAll those military projects were designated as part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion chain of infrastructure development programs stretching across some 70 countries, built and financed by Beijing.\nChinese officials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent. But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions \u2014 and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure initiative is really about helping China project armed might.\nAs China\u2019s strategically located and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan has been the leading example of how the Chinese projects are being used to give Beijing both favor and leverage among its clients.\nSince the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Pakistan has been the program\u2019s flagship site, with some $62 billion in projects planned in the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In the process, China has lent more and more money to Pakistan at a time of economic desperation there, binding the two countries ever closer.\nFor the most part, Pakistan has eagerly turned more toward China as the chill with the United States has deepened. Some Pakistani officials are growing concerned about losing sovereignty to their deep-pocketed Asian ally, but the host of ways the two countries are now bound together may leave Pakistan with little choice but to go along.\nEven before the revelation of the new Chinese-Pakistani military cooperation, some of China\u2019s biggest projects in Pakistan had clear strategic implications.\nUzbekistan\nKashgar\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nIran\nPakistan\nIndia\nChinese road projects\nChinese port projects\nKarachi\nGwadar Port\n200 miles\nArabian Sea\nUzbekistan\nKashgar\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nPakistan\nIndia\nIran\nChinese road projects\nChinese port projects\nKarachi\nGwadar Port\n200 miles\nArabian Sea\nKashgar\nUzbekistan\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nPakistan\nIran\nIndia\nGwadar\nPort\nKarachi\nChinese road projects\n200 miles\nChinese port projects\nA Chinese-built seaport and special economic zone in the Pakistani town of Gwadar is rooted in trade, giving China a quicker route to get goods to the Arabian Sea. But it also gives Beijing a strategic card to play against India and the United States if tensions worsen to the point of naval blockades as the two powers increasingly confront each other at sea.\nA less scrutinized component of Belt and Road is the central role Pakistan plays in China\u2019s Beidou satellite navigation system. Pakistan is the only other country that has been granted access to the system\u2019s military service, allowing more precise guidance for missiles, ships and aircraft.\nThe cooperation is meant to be a blueprint for Beidou\u2019s expansion to other Belt and Road nations, however, ostensibly ending its clients\u2019 reliance on the American military-run GPS network that Chinese officials fear is monitored and manipulated by the United States.\n[Read The Times\u2019s series \u201cChina Rules,\u201d about how China wrote its playbook to counter the West.]\nIn Pakistan, China has found an amenable ally with much to recommend it: shared borders and a long history of cooperation; a hedge in South Asia against India; a large market for arms sales and trade with potential for growth; a wealth of natural resources.\nNow, China is also finding a better showcase for its security and surveillance technology in a place once defined by its close military relationship with the United States.\n\u201cThe focus of Belt and Road is on roads and bridges and ports, because those are the concrete construction projects that people can easily see. But it\u2019s the technologies of the future and technologies of future security systems that could be the biggest security threat in the Belt and Road project,\u201d said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a cyberthreat intelligence monitoring company based in Massachusetts.\nAn Asset on the Sea\nThe tightening China-Pakistan security alliance has gained momentum on a long road to the Arabian Sea.\nIn 2015, under Belt and Road, China took a nascent port in the Pakistani coastal town of Gwadar and supercharged the project with an estimated $800 million development plan that included a large special economic zone for Chinese companies.\nLinking the port to western China would be a new 2,000-mile network of highways and rails through the most forbidding stretch of Pakistan: Baluchistan Province, a resource-rich region plagued by militancy.\nThe public vision for the project was that it would allow Chinese goods to bypass much longer and more expensive shipping routes through the Indian Ocean and avoid the territorial waters of several American allies in Asia.\nFrom the beginning, though, key details of the project were kept from the public and lawmakers, officials say, including the terms of its loan structure and the length of the lease, more than 40 years, that a Chinese state-owned company secured to operate the port.\nIf there was concern within Pakistan about the hidden costs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, also known as CPEC, there was growing suspicion abroad about a hidden military aspect, as well.\nIn recent years, Chinese state-owned companies have built or begun constructing seaports at strategic spots around the Indian Ocean, including places in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Malaysia.\nChinese officials insisted that the ports would not be militarized. But analysts began wondering whether China\u2019s endgame was to muscle its way onto coastal territories that could become prime military assets \u2014 much as it did when it started militarizing contested islands in the South China Sea.\nThen, Sri Lanka, unable to repay its ballooning debt with China, handed over the Chinese-built port at Hambantota in a 99-year lease agreement last year. Indian and American officials expressed a growing conviction that taking control of the port had been China\u2019s intent all along.\nIn October, Vice President Mike Pence said Sri Lanka was a warning for all Belt and Road countries that China was luring them into debt traps.\n\u201cChina uses so-called debt diplomacy to expand its influence,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a speech.\n\u201cJust ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of questionable commercial value,\u201d Mr. Pence added. \u201cIt may soon become a forward military base for China\u2019s growing blue-water navy.\u201d\nMilitary analysts predict that China could use Gwadar to expand the naval footprint of its attack submarines, after agreeing in 2015 to sell eight submarines to Pakistan in a deal worth up to $6 billion. China could use the equipment it sells to the South Asian country to refuel its own submarines, extending its navy\u2019s global reach.\nDeepening Debt\nWhen China inaugurated Belt and Road, in 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s new government in Pakistan saw it as the answer for a host of problems.\nForeign investment in Pakistan was scant, driven away by terrorist attacks and the country\u2019s enduring reputation for corruption. And Pakistan desperately needed a modern power grid to help ease persistent electricity shortages.\nPakistani officials say that Beijing first proposed the highway from China\u2019s western Xinjiang region through Pakistan that connected to Gwadar port. But Pakistani officials insisted that new coal power plants be built. China agreed.\nWith CPEC under fresh scrutiny, Chinese and Pakistani officials in recent weeks have contended that Pakistan has a debt problem, but not a Chinese debt problem. In October, the country\u2019s central bank revealed an overall debt and liability burden of about $215 billion, with $95 billion externally held. With nearly half of CPEC\u2019s projects completed \u2014 in terms of worth \u2014 Pakistan currently owes China $23 billion.\nBut the country stands to owe $62 billion to China \u2014 before interest balloons the figure to some $90 billion \u2014 under the plan for Belt and Road\u2019s expansion there in coming years.\nPakistan\u2019s central bank governor, Ashraf Wathra, said publicly in 2015 that he had no clarity on Chinese investments in Pakistan and was concerned about rising debt levels. It still took him months after that to secure a briefing from cabinet officials.\n\u201cMy main question was, \u2018Do we have any feasibility studies of these projects and a cost-benefit analysis?\u2019 Their answers were all evasive,\u201d recalled Mr. Wathra, who has since retired.\nAhsan Iqbal, a cabinet minister and the main architect for CPEC in the previous government, said the project was well thought-through and dismissed Mr. Wathra\u2019s account.\n\u201cNo one wanted to invest here \u2014 the Chinese took a chance,\u201d Mr. Iqbal said in an interview.\nBut the bill is coming due. Pakistan\u2019s first debt repayments to China are set for next year, starting at about $300 million and gradually increasing to reach about $3.2 billion by 2026, according to officials. And Pakistan is already having trouble paying what it owes to Chinese companies.\nFighter Jets and Satellites\nAccording to the undisclosed proposal drawn up by the Pakistani Air Force and Chinese officials at the start of the year, a special economic zone under CPEC would be created in Pakistan to produce a new generation of fighter jets. For the first time, navigation systems, radar systems and onboard weapons would be built jointly by the countries at factories in Pakistan.\nThe proposal, confirmed by officials at the Ministry of Planning and Development, would expand China and Pakistan\u2019s current cooperation on the JF-17 fighter jet, which is assembled at Pakistan\u2019s military-run Kamra Aeronautical Complex in Punjab Province. The Chinese-designed jets have given Pakistan an alternative to the American-built F-16 fighters that have become more difficult to obtain as Islamabad\u2019s relationship with Washington frays.\nThe plans are in the final stages of approval, but the current government is expected to rubber stamp the project, officials in Islamabad say.\nFor China, Pakistan could become a showcase for other countries seeking to shift their militaries away from American equipment and toward Chinese arms, Western diplomats said. And because China is not averse to selling such advanced weaponry as ballistic missiles \u2014 which the United States will not sell to allies like Saudi Arabia \u2014 the deal with Pakistan could be a steppingstone to a bigger market for Chinese weapons in the Muslim world.\nFor years, some of the most important military coordination between China and Pakistan has been going on in space.\nJust months before Beijing unveiled the Belt and Road project in 2013, it signed an agreement with Pakistan to build a network of satellite stations inside the South Asian country to establish the Beidou Navigation System as an alternative to the American GPS network.\nBeidou quickly became a core component of Belt and Road, with the Chinese government calling the satellite network part of an \u201cinformation Silk Road\u201d in a 2015 white paper.\nLike GPS, Beidou has a civilian function and a military one. If its trial with Pakistan goes well, Beijing could offer Beidou\u2019s military service to other countries, creating a bloc of nations whose military actions would be more difficult for the United States to monitor.\nBy 2020, all 35 satellites for the system will be launched in collaboration with other Belt and Road countries, completing Beidou.\n\u201cBeidou, whatever any users use it for \u2014 whether it\u2019s a civilian navigating their way to the grocery store or a government using it to coordinate their rocket launches \u2014 those are all things that China can track,\u201d said Ms. Moriuchi, of the research group Recorded Future. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what is most striking: that this authoritarian government will be a major technology provider for numerous countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.\u201d\nFor the Pentagon, China\u2019s satellite launches are ominous.\nChina\u2019s military \u201ccontinues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space,\u201d including developing Beidou and new weaponry, according to a Pentagon report issued to Congress in May.\nIn October, Pakistan\u2019s information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said that by 2022, Pakistan would send its own astronaut into space with China\u2019s help.\n\u201cWe are close to China, and we are getting more close,\u201d he said in a later interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the West to wake up and recognize our importance.\u201d\nWooing Pakistan\u2019s Military\nThough the relationship between China and Pakistan has clearly grown closer, it has not been without tension. CPEC could still be vulnerable to political shifts in Pakistan \u2014 as happened this year in Malaysia, which shelved three big projects by Chinese companies.\nCampaigning during the parliamentary elections that made him prime minister in July, Imran Khan vowed to review CPEC projects and renegotiate them if he won. In September, after meeting in Saudi Arabia with the crown prince, Mr. Khan said that the kingdom had agreed to invest in CPEC too.\nPakistan\u2019s new commerce minister then proposed pausing all CPEC projects while the government assessed them.\nThe moves by Pakistan\u2019s new government angered Beijing, which was concerned they could set back Belt and Road globally.\nBut in Pakistan, China has a steady ally it can approach to smooth things over: the country\u2019s powerful military establishment, which stands to fill its coffers with millions of dollars through CPEC as the military\u2019s construction companies win infrastructure bids.\nShortly after the commerce minister\u2019s comments, the Pakistani Army\u2019s top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, hurried to Beijing for an unannounced visit with President Xi Jinping. The meeting came six weeks before Mr. Khan made his first official visit with the Chinese president, a trip he had listed as a priority.\nStatements from the military said General Bajwa and Mr. Xi spoke extensively about Belt and Road projects.\nGeneral Bajwa \u201csaid that the Belt and Road initiative with CPEC as its flagship is destined to succeed despite all odds, and Pakistan\u2019s army shall ensure security of CPEC at all costs,\u201d read a statement from the Pakistani military.\nShortly after the Beijing meeting, Pakistan\u2019s government rolled back its invitation to Saudi Arabia to join CPEC and all talk of pausing or canceling Chinese projects has stopped.\nBut China could face another challenge to its investments: a Pakistani financial crisis that has forced Mr. Khan\u2019s government to seek loans from international lenders that require transparency.\nThroughout September, international delegations traveled to Islamabad carrying the same message: Reveal the extent of Chinese loans if you want financial assistance.\nIn a late September meeting with visiting officials from the International Monetary Fund, Pakistan\u2019s government asked for a bailout of up to $12 billion. The fund\u2019s representatives pressed Pakistan to share all existing agreements with the Chinese government and demanded I.M.F. input during any future CPEC negotiations \u2014 a previously undisclosed facet of the negotiations, according to communications seen by the Fund and a Pakistani official. The fund also sought assurances that Pakistan would not use a bailout to repay CPEC loans.\nBut the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad stepped up its engagement as well, demanding that CPEC deals be kept secret and promising to shore up Pakistan\u2019s finances with bilateral loans, Pakistani officials say.\nThree months after taking office, Mr. Khan still has not made good on his campaign promises to reveal the nature of the $62 billion investment Beijing has committed to Pakistan, and his government has backtracked on an I.M.F. deal.\nIn early November, Mr. Khan visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, a trip during which he was expected to clinch bilateral loans and grants to ease Pakistan\u2019s financial crisis.\nInstead, his government walked away with vague promises of a deal \u201cin principle,\u201d but refused to disclose any details.\nLuz Ding contributed reporting from Beijing.\nAdvertisement", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/world/asia/pakistan-china-belt-road-military.html",

Out in Video\nFor the second time in a month, the entertainment news website TMZ has obtained and released video apparently showing an N.F.L. player engaged in off-field violence, this time Washington Redskins safety Montae Nicholson, who seems to knock a man out cold during a late-night brawl in Virginia.\nTMZ has not said how it obtained the video, but it is open about its willingness to pay for valuable videos and information. Last week the N.F.L. insisted that it would not pay for video evidence of player involvement in off-field incidents.\nThe newest video appears to show Nicholson, 23, throw one man to the ground and punch another man several times, including a hit that seems to render the man unconscious as he falls to the ground. TMZ published the video a day after Nicholson was accused of assault and arrested by sheriffs in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nHe was later released after posting a $2,500 bond.\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s daily crime report, the incident happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday in Ashburn, Virginia. The Loudon County Sheriff\u2019s Office said that Nicholson assaulted a man while a woman he was with struck another woman with a bottle. One of the victims said Nicholson and the woman pulled up in a car and honked the horn. An argument followed, then punches were thrown.\nNicholson was charged with assault and battery, and public drunkenness, while the woman was charged with malicious wounding and assault and battery.\nThe victims, unnamed in the report, were taken to a hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.\nOn Tuesday, league and Washington officials said they were looking into the incident. Washington later moved Nicholson, a second-year player out of Michigan State, to the reserve/non-football injury list, ruling him out of the next two games and thus ending his season.\nThe investigation may speed up now that video of the fight, which looks like it was taken with a cellphone camera, has been made public. It was only last month, after TMZ published video of former Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt shoving and kicking a woman in a Cleveland hotel lobby, that the league chose to suspend Hunt.\nThe league said it tried unsuccessfully to obtain surveillance video of the incident involving Hunt, which raised questions about whether the N.F.L. was taking investigations into player off-field behavior seriously enough. The league insists that paying for video would lead to bidding wars, and prompt people to use their cellphones to film players in hopes of selling the recording.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/sports/montae-nicholson-video-washington-redskins.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "football", "score": "0.62132"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.27821"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.18447"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.09483"}, {"label": "assaults", "score": "0.09256"}, {"label": "violence", "score": "0.08480"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.08473"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.07298"}, {"label": "games", "score": "0.04791"}, {"label": "sex crimes", "score": "0.03479"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02398"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02336"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.01746"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01653"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.01451"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01385"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01343"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.01226"}, {"label": "rewards", "score": "0.01205"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.01000"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.00975"}, {"label": "privacy", "score": "0.00955"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.00950"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00872"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00861"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.00833"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00756"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.00729"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00568"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00553"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Washington", "Virginia", "Loudoun County", "Virginia", "Ashburn", "Virginia", "Loudon County", "Washington", "Washington", "Michigan", "Kansas City", "Cleveland"], "ORG": ["TMZ", "N.F.L.", "Washington Redskins", "TMZ", "N.F.L.", "TMZ", "Nicholson", "TMZ", "N.F.L."], "PERSON": ["Montae Nicholson", "Montae Nicholson", "Nicholson", "Nicholson", "Nicholson", "Nicholson", "Nicholson", "Kareem Hunt", "Hunt", "Hunt"]}}, {"index": 31, "year": 2018, "title": "Gatwick Airport Shut Down by \u2018Deliberate\u2019 Drone Incursions", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/europe/gatwick-airport-drones.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "Supported by\nGatwick Airport Shut Down by \u2018Deliberate\u2019 Drone Incursions\nLONDON \u2014 It is one of the busiest airports in Europe. It survived World War II, when it served as a base for R.A.F. night fighters flying missions against Nazi Germany. It has just been brought to a standstill by the humble drone.\n\u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened anywhere in the world before,\u201d said Richard Gill, the founder and chief executive of Drone Defence, which helps institutions guard their perimeters against drones.\nThe Gatwick shutdown scrambled hundreds of flights, stranded tens of thousands of passengers and reduced the British government to playing cat-and-mouse with the drones. Controlled, perhaps, by little more than an iPad, they were repeatedly sent over the runway of the country\u2019s second-largest airport in what officials called a \u201cdeliberate act.\u201d\nOn Thursday, about 20 police units searched the perimeter of the airfield for the drones\u2019 operators. By nightfall, the government said it would deploy the military in a bid to reopen the airport, though it was not clear what its role would be.\nPolice sharpshooters were spotted at Gatwick, though officials at one point had precluded that option, citing the risk of a stray bullet hitting someone.\nThe airport finally reopened around 6 a.m. on Friday, more than 24 hours after a drone was first sighted, and the Gatwick website warned passengers who were hoping to travel that flights would still be subject to delays and cancellations.\nThe episode was proving not only a humiliation for aviation officials but also the starkest evidence to date of how vulnerable airports across the world are to the readily available flying devices.\n\u201cOver 90 percent of airports in the world are unprepared for drones,\u201d said Tim Bean, the founder and chief executive of Fortem Technologies, which is testing a drone defense system on several American runways. \u201cAirports, stadiums, borders, oil and gas refineries \u2014 they spend a lot of money on ground security, but I think they now need to think about their airspace security.\u201d\nAs hobbyists and malfeasants alike turn neighborhood parks into airports, the newly democratized skies are becoming increasingly crowded.\nThe number of aircraft scares involving drones recorded by the British government has shot up to more than 100 this year; there were none in 2013. In Mexico and Canada, planes recently survived collisions with what appeared to be drones.\nThe authorities have so far released little information about the type of drones that were buzzing Gatwick, though airport officials said they captured surveillance footage of them. \u201cAs yet, the drone has not been identified,\u201d the Sussex Police said in a statement.\nAirport staff members first spotted a pair of drones flying over the perimeter fence and into the runway area around 9 p.m. Wednesday.\nOfficials shut the runway, then reopened it around 3 a.m. on Thursday before closing it again about 45 minutes later when there was another sighting. Yet another drone was spotted late Thursday morning, and people kept spotting drones through Thursday night. In all, the police said there were 50 reports of drone sightings, though some were duplicates or unconfirmed.\nPolice officials said there were \u201cno indications to suggest this is terror related.\u201d\nAt least 800 flights were canceled, disrupting traffic throughout Europe and affecting upward of 100,000 passengers. Arriving flights carrying 10,000 passengers were diverted, with some travelers forced to land at airports as far away as Paris.\nThe shutdown created bedlam at the south terminal of Gatwick, which is about 25 miles south of central London and is regularly rated Europe\u2019s worst airport and one of the worst in the world. Long lines of weary passengers stretched from the check-in counters to the arrivals area of an adjacent building.\nPassengers slumped over their luggage, refreshing their smartphone screens every few minutes for updates. Others sat staring into space, looking utterly defeated.\n\u201cWho around here can give me some information?\u201d Gary Hornby, 47, shouted after cursing at an airport staff member.\n\u201cWhen the hell are we getting out of here?\u201d he went on, kicking his suitcase.\nSome passengers were baffled at how poorly prepared the airport seemed.\n\u201cThis is a huge security risk,\u201d said Alison Carter, 44, a teacher of German. \u201cHow does the airport not have the resources to down the drone? What kind of message does this give to terrorists and criminals?\u201d\nTechnology companies have invented several drone defense systems, but they are relatively new, and airports and government officials are still weighing which to invest in. One system that was recently deployed to stop drug smuggling at an English prison acts as an electronic fence, blocking radio signals around a prison whenever drones are detected.\nMr. Gill, the founder of Drone Defence \u2014 which made the electronic fence \u2014 said that airports were technologically complex landscapes and that officials were studying all the available options. He said the mishap at Gatwick would concentrate people\u2019s minds on the potential dangers.\nThe system developed by Fortem Technologies uses a sophisticated radar system to detect intruder drones, and then sends a drone hunter to pluck them out of the sky, dog-fighting with them, if necessary. The system is already being used to monitor two runways at Salt Lake City International Airport and others, he said.\nBut, Mr. Bean said, as airports focus on building tools to intercept drones that emit radio frequency signals, they are finding that drones have evolved far beyond that technology. That renders many of the current security systems obsolete.\nBritish laws make it illegal to fly a drone within a kilometer \u2014 about three-fifths of a mile \u2014 of airport boundaries. Violators are subject to five years in prison.\nAnd as of next Nov. 30, owners of drones weighing more than 250 grams, or a bit more than half a pound, will have to register them with the Civil Aviation Authority, and those who fly them will have to pass an online safety test. Not following these steps could result in fines of as much as $1,270.\nAirports have been shut down before over drone sightings \u2014 including Gatwick, which was closed after sightings in July 2017. Airports in Chengdu, China; Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and Ottawa have also had to shut down.\nMany drones have internal GPS software that prevents pilots from flying them into restricted areas like airports. But Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in drones, said the systems were imperfect and could be subverted by people who understood their workings.\nAnd they can do a lot of damage.\n\u201cThe danger is pretty much the same as with birds: A drone may get caught in an engine during takeoff and landing,\u201d Ms. Franke said. \u201cIt\u2019s plastic, metal and lithium batteries that can explode.\u201d\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when certain drone owners must begin registering and passing a safety test. The date is Nov. 30, 2019, not this past Nov. 30.\nHow we handle corrections\nAdam Satariano and Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from London, and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/europe/gatwick-airport-drones.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.76541"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.35387"}, {"label": "airports", "score": "0.32753"}, {"label": "military aircraft", "score": "0.11493"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.09639"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.09203"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.04876"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.04690"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.04211"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.04169"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.03816"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.03808"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.03127"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.02655"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.02469"}, {"label": "pentagon building", "score": "0.02195"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.02193"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.02070"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01663"}, {"label": "shutdowns (institutional)", "score": "0.01535"}, {"label": "world war ii (1939-45)", "score": "0.01509"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01389"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.01360"}, {"label": "air forces", "score": "0.01332"}, {"label": "missing persons", "score": "0.01315"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.01258"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01072"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.00995"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.00932"}, {"label": "christians and christianity", "score": "0.00921"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["LONDON", "Nazi Germany", "Mexico", "Canada", "Paris", "London", "Chengdu", "China", "Dubai", "the United Arab Emirates", "Ottawa", "London", "Hong Kong"], "ORG": ["R.A.F.", "Drone Defence", "iPad", "Gatwick", "Fortem Technologies", "malfeasants", "the Sussex Police", "Drone Defence", "Gatwick", "Fortem Technologies", "the Civil Aviation Authority", "the European Council on Foreign Relations"], "PERSON": ["Richard Gill", "Tim Bean", "Gary Hornby", "Alison Carter", "Gill", "Bean", "Ulrike Franke", "Franke", "Adam Satariano", "Ceylan Yeginsu", "Daniel Victor"]}}, {"index": 32, "year": 2018, "title": "4 Men Held in Tourist Killings in Morocco.

Denmark Calls It \u2018Act of Terror.\u2019\nMartin Selsoe Sorensen and\nCOPENHAGEN \u2014 The authorities in Morocco said on Thursday that three more suspects had been arrested in the killings of two Scandinavian tourists in the Atlas Mountains, in what Danish officials suggested was an act of terror linked to the Islamic State.\nThe Central Office of Judicial Research in Morocco said in a statement that the three suspects had been detained in Marrakesh. Another suspect arrested on Tuesday was thought to have extremist ties, Moroccan prosecutors told local news outlets without providing further details. The names of those arrested were not immediately released.\nThe authorities said that the bodies of the victims, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway, were found on Monday by other tourists in an isolated area of the High Atlas Mountains, an area popular with hikers and six miles from the village of Imlil. Both women had been studying at the same school in Norway to become tour guides.\nPrime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of Denmark said on Thursday that the killings might be \u201cpolitically motivated, and thereby an act of terror.\u201d He added that \u201cthere are still dark forces that want to fight our values\u201d and that \u201cwe must not give in.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. He vowed to do everything possible to solve the crime.\nA video posted on social media purported to show one of the victims screaming while a man cut her neck with a knife. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said it was working to authenticate the video.\nIn the statement, the intelligence service said it was an \u201cunusually gruesome\u201d case: \u201cThe video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s National Criminal Investigation Service, the special unit of the Norwegian police known as Kripos, said it was trying to have the video removed from websites, according to local news reports.\nThe affiliation of the suspects was unclear, but the four had recorded a video a week before the killings, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, according to Morocco\u2019s general prosecutor.\nThe video, which was shared on Twitter, showed the men vowing fealty to the group\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and saying that they \u201ccannot remain seated, witnessing the destruction caused by Crusader planes,\u201d terminology typically used by the group to refer to Western airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.\nPrime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway called the killings \u201ca senseless attack,\u201d adding that the case \u201cemphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.\u201d She said that Norway would assist the Moroccan authorities in their investigation.\nThe deaths have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. But the country has battled Islamic extremism for years, and thousands of Moroccans have joined the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The last terrorist attack happened in Marrakesh in 2011, when a bomb attack in a cafe killed 17 people, including 11 Europeans.\nThe foreign ministries in Norway and Demark issued travel advisories on Thursday warning their citizens to exercise extreme caution when visiting Morocco.\nAbdellah Rami, a Moroccan expert on Islamist movements, said that if the terrorism link were to be verified, it would be the first terrorist attack outside Morocco\u2019s urban areas.\n\u201cThe ideological identity is clear, but the organization they\u2019re affiliated to isn\u2019t,\u201d he said on Thursday of the suspects. \u201cSo the question is, did they commit this independently or was it a sleeper cell?\u201d\nHe noted that the attack \u201ctargets very sensitive matters like tourism, which is an essential component of the Moroccan economy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is hard for the authorities to protect these areas and easier for organizations like ISIS to start operating in these places.\u201d\nMs. Ueland\u2019s mother, Irene Ueland, was quoted in a regional newspaper as describing the killings as \u201cpure madness.\u201d\nMs. Jespersen wrote a post on Nov. 21 on Facebook about her coming trip: \u201cDear friends, I\u2019m going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys who\u2019s around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?\u201d\nThe site where the bodies were found is often the starting point for treks to Mount Toubkal, North Africa\u2019s highest peak.\nMs. Jespersen\u2019s family told Danish news media that she had traveled to Morocco on Dec. 8 to celebrate Christmas and to practice climbing with her Norwegian friend. Since the age of 18, her relatives said, she had a habit of traveling for the holiday.\nOn their last phone call before the trip, Ms. Jespersen told her mother, Helle Jespersen, who lives in Grindsted, west of Copenhagen, that she was excited and busy with exams at the Norwegian school where she was studying to become a tour guide.\n\u201cShe was always happy and positive,\u201d he mother said in interviews with Danish news outlets. \u201cEverybody got along with her and she made everybody their best.\u201d She added, \u201cYou would have to prove it to her if she was to believe in evil.\u201d\nAccording to Moroccan news reports, investigators recovered surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims\u2019 tent and leaving the area after their deaths.\nMartin Selsoe Sorensen reported from Copenhagen, and Aida Alami from Paris.

They went breezing by, lightheartedly addressing large ideas while alluding to decades of R&B and hip-hop. Her music was often skeletal \u2014 a handful of looped instruments \u2014 but most of the songs sounded complete, not truncated.\nIt was a miniature tour de force, and enough to get Whack noticed by the Grammys (which, with typical befuddlement, nominated an earlier, more conventional track, \u201cMumbo Jumbo,\u201d for best music video). In its deceptively casual ambition and ruthless brevity, \u201cWhack World\u201d had a brilliant strategy for combat in the attention economy: keep things short and visual.\nBecause, really, who has time for music?\nListeners have work, or school, or both, and work in the internet era has grown infinitely expandable past 9 to 5. Because so much music now arrives via streaming, controlled on a screen, music also has to share attention with everything else on that screen: texts, social media, videos, alerts, news feeds, games, searches, maps, maybe one more check on that work email. Perhaps some single-minded listeners can set all those distractions aside, but they\u2019re a minority.\n[Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\nMusicians face countless distractions of their own. The internet shattered the old album cycle of studio seclusion (for audio recording, and then for audio plus video) followed by promotion and touring. That prospect seemed freeing at first, since music could appear when inspiration struck, in any grouping or length.\nAlong came the unintended consequences. Without the routine expectation of, say, a 12-song album every two or three years, the internet looms as a giant, insatiable maw, constantly demanding more content with less payback. YouTube and streaming have made each song a click rather than a purchase \u2014 and not even a click with autoplay, prefab playlists and algorithmic \u201cdiscovery\u201d (which actually pushes toward more of the same niche) guiding the way. In that endless stream, the idea that a song is a thought-out, carefully distilled utterance was bound to erode.\nAdd another factor: social media. The initial promise was increased connectivity, a way to reach and respond to fans quickly and candidly: no gatekeepers, no filters. But for most pop aspirants, the result has been the end of creative seclusion. There\u2019s pressure to keep offering new material, musical and nonmusical, making the promotional cycle as endless as the internet workday. Maybe it\u2019s a song snippet or a glimpse of a video shoot. Or maybe it\u2019s a Twitter feud, a media-ready screed on Facebook or a fashion experiment on Instagram.\nAs marketing, it\u2019s relatively low-budget \u2014 and democratizing \u2014 but the potential for distraction is boundless. Billie Eilish, a 17-year-old songwriter who has been releasing ominously compelling songs about desire and intimate betrayal since 2016, tabulates 24 million listeners monthly on Spotify and tours internationally as a headliner. But she will be just getting around to releasing her debut album in 2019. In the meantime, she gathers about two million likes each time she posts a pouty photo on Instagram. Musicians aren\u2019t exempt from the gamified, instant-gratification metrics that keep users on social media, and the narcissism that often goes with being a performer might make them even more susceptible.\nTechnology and distribution mechanisms \u2014 the guitar, the microphone, the LP, radio \u2014 have always shaped music. Now, social media and streaming are rewarding a rapidly changing skill set. It\u2019s a different kind of career that makes music just one part of a pool of cultural content: aural, visual, textual, entrepreneurial. That model grew out of hip-hop. But in the social media age, the career path is different. Cardi B was a stripper turned sassy social-media figure who made her public pivot into hip-hop on a reality-TV series. She has been rapidly and diligently improving her singing, rapping and writing, but at the same time, she has kept her snappy social-media presence in full force. Together they multiply her cultural leverage; the impact is more important than the means.\nPop celebrity has always demanded a certain amount of spectacle, from magazine photo sessions to video clips. But now, social media is pushing that spectacle to become continuous, intimate and hyperactive on multiple fronts. Performers gather shards of attention into a multimedia mosaic that\u2019s presented like a soap opera coupled with a surveillance log: evidence of authenticity that can turn forensic. Daniel Hernandez, the rapper known as 6ix9ine, flaunted a gun-toting tough-guy image in raps and on social media \u2014 he has nearly 16 million Instagram followers \u2014 but has ended up charged with real-world gang activities, with prosecutors citing his social-media postings.\nFor the 21st-century pop figure, songs are part of the mix, but so are romances and breakups, professional rivalries and reconciliations and countless rumors and memes that might be generated by the stars themselves, their fans or their trolls. Which in turn feed back into the next round of songs.\nAriana Grande\u2019s 2018 album, \u201cSweetener,\u201d exulted in a blissful, erotic romance, including a track, \u201cPete Davidson,\u201d named after her boyfriend. Soon after they broke up came a self-healing single, \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d that listed exes\u2019 names and promised that she was now in love with herself. Its video clip, with more than 200 million YouTube views, mocked social-media misinformation. It\u2019s a full-fledged, old-school pop song, complete with song-and-dance video extravaganza, but it\u2019s also the latest episode in her continuing personal saga.\nPerhaps, in a culture that\u2019s constantly staring at a small screen, music was bound to be pushed aside. Songs that become massive streaming hits often sound unfinished, a looped riff and a vocal with a few tweaks. They fit into playlists that go by unobtrusively as background music; they are the ticktock of a soundtrack to everyday life. But songs can also have a higher profile. They can astound us with timbres never heard before and rhythms that kick and shake; they can tell us things we weren\u2019t sure we knew.\nAnd there is an audience for them. As the perceived value of recorded music has dropped nearly to zero, people have been willing to pay more and more each year for live concerts \u2014 where the music is the main thing in the room, where distractions are minimized. According to figures from the concert-promotion magazine Pollstar, for the top 100 tours of 2018 alone, gross revenues worldwide were $5.6 billion and average ticket prices rose from $84.63 in 2017 to $93.65 this year. In North America, the leap was even greater, from $78.91 to $92.50. Music can still be a central, overwhelming experience. We just have to put away the phones.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/arts/music/pop-music-social-media-distraction.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "music", "score": "0.93104"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.60567"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.25352"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.24341"}, {"label": "rock music", "score": "0.02793"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02778"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.02090"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.02043"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.01462"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01457"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01105"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.00932"}, {"label": "recordings and downloads (audio)", "score": "0.00726"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.00564"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.00535"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.00533"}, {"label": "classical music", "score": "0.00489"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.00464"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.00451"}, {"label": "concerts and recitals", "score": "0.00428"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.00393"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00386"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.00329"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00282"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00266"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00241"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00234"}, {"label": "internet and world wide web", "score": "0.00211"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.00198"}, {"label": "rap music", "score": "0.00197"}], "NER": {"GPE": [], "ORG": ["the Era of Distraction", "Grammys", "YouTube", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Spotify", "Instagram", "Instagram", "Pollstar"], "PERSON": ["Mumbo Jumbo", "Billie Eilish", "Cardi", "Daniel Hernandez", "Ariana Grande", "Pete Davidson"]}}, {"index": 34, "year": 2018, "title": "Marburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/health/marburg-virus-fruit-bats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "Supported by\nGlobal health\nMarburg Virus, Related to Ebola, Is Found in Bats in West Africa\nThe discovery was part of a U.S.-led effort to spot dangerous pathogens in animals before humans are endangered.\nThe Marburg virus, a deadly cousin of Ebola, has been isolated in fruit bats in Sierra Leone, marking the first time it has been found in West Africa.\nFive bats caught in three health districts tested positive for the virus, according to two teams of scientists. One was led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Sierra Leone\u2019s Njala University, and the second by the University of California, Davis, and Sierra Leone\u2019s University of Makeni.\nEgyptian rousette fruit bats are known to harbor the virus elsewhere in Africa, \u201cso it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019d find the virus in bats there\u201d in West Africa, said Jonathan S. Towner, an ecological diseases specialist who led the C.D.C. team.\nThe testing was done as part of a relatively new American-led effort to spot dangerous pathogens lurking in animals and take steps to prevent them from crossing over into humans and triggering lethal outbreaks.\nKnown as Predict, it is paid for by the United States Agency for International Development.\nDiscoveries like the one in Sierra Leone are \u201cexactly what Predict\u2019s \u2018one health\u2019 approach to disease surveillance and capacity building are designed to do,\u201d said Dr. Brian Bird, leader of the U.C. Davis team.\nA \u201cone health\u201d approach means uniting the work of medical doctors and veterinarians \u2014 and occasionally plant biologists \u2014 to search for threats to humans that lurk in other species.\nPredict projects also train local scientists to carry on the work after its teams move on.\nEgyptian fruit bats \u2014 also called \u201cflying foxes,\u201d because of their dog-like faces \u2014 are found as far south as South Africa and as far east as Pakistan and northern India. They are not migratory, but it is not known how far individuals or groups normally range.\nGenetic testing found multiple strains of the virus in each bat, suggesting it had circulated in West African colonies for many years.\nThere have been no known human Marburg outbreaks in West Africa, but the potential for one exists.\nFrom 2013 to 2016, West Africa endured the biggest Ebola outbreak in history, which killed more than 11,000 people. The first patient was thought to have been a child who often played in a bat-infested tree.\nThe virus was named for the German city where it was first detected in 1967, nine years before the discovery of Ebola. A mysterious disease that included hemorrhagic fevers struck workers at a vaccine factory who had handled a shipment of green monkeys from Uganda. The virus also infected people in Frankfurt and Belgrade; 31 people fell ill, and seven died.\nThe bats are about six inches long with wings two feet wide; they roost in caves or in the deep forest, and come out at night to eat fruit \u2014 a habit that leads fruit farmers to poison large numbers of them.\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\nThe bats shed the virus in their feces, urine and saliva. Scientists believe animals, including monkeys, may pick up Marburg virus by eating fruit that bats have gnawed.\nHumans may get it from being bitten when they capture bats to eat, from cuts during food preparation or from infectious bat guano. Most human outbreaks have begun in people who visited bat-infested caves or mines.\nThe largest known outbreak of Marburg virus, which began in Angola in 2004, sickened over 250 people and had a 90 percent fatality rate. Two of the strains found in Sierra Leone bats were similar to the Angolan ones.\nDonald G. McNeil Jr. is a science reporter covering epidemics and diseases of the world\u2019s poor.

He loved decorating trees, singing songs like \u201cSilent Night\u201d and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.\nBut in early December, the police shut down Mr. Gu\u2019s usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu, as part of what activists say is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated Bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain\u2019s outspoken pastor on charges of \u201cinciting subversion,\u201d punishable in serious cases by at least five years in prison.\nOn Christmas Eve, Mr. Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend\u2019s home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Mr. Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.\n\u201cWe will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,\u201d Mr. Gu said.\nAs millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.\nMr. Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party\u2019s dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party\u2019s control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.\nThe campaign comes as Mr. Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.\nRUSSIA\nMONGOLIA\nXINJIANG\nBeijing\nCHINA\nChengdu\nSICHUAN\nGuangzhou\nINDIA\nMYANMAR\n500 Miles\nRenee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the \u201cheart of the underground Christian resistance.\u201d The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party\u2019s grip on society.\n\u201cThe message,\u201d Ms. Xia said, \u201cis that Xi can\u2019t be messed with.\u201d\nThe crackdown escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshipers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closing of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.\nThe government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.\nMany in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China\u2019s fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China\u2019s authoritarian government and Mr. Xi\u2019s embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.\nBut the government\u2019s heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.\nOn Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain\u2019s former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.\nLi Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. \u201cWe have moved underground,\u201d he said.\nMembers have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church\u2019s former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.\nMr. Wang, in a prewritten message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.\n\u201cThe Communist regime\u2019s persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.\u201d\nMr. Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled \u201cThe God Who Bestows Peace.\u201d Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.\nAt Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.\nA children\u2019s choir sang \u201cSilent Night,\u201d and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.\nThe anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.\n\u201cIf you see the police, national security or community workers, greet them with gentleness,\u201d Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. \u201cIf they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.\u201d\nWhile he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Mr. Wen asked those in attendance to remember \u201cthose who are criminally detained.\u201d Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.\nSince Mr. Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches from 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.\nThis year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d plays in the background at malls.\nOfficials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.\n\u201cChina\u2019s Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.\nBut China\u2019s growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.\nOne notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.\nDespite Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to expand the officially atheist party\u2019s control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing.\nWhile official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshiping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.\nIndependent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.\nWhile sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.\nEarly Rain, which Mr. Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Mr. Wang called Mr. Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.\nMr. Gu, the rice seller, began attending services two years ago after finding videos of Mr. Wang\u2019s fiery sermons online. He felt Mr. Wang\u2019s concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Mr. Gu was baptized last year.\n\u201cI saw injustices in society,\u201d Mr. Gu said. \u201cI saw that the government\u2019s promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.\u201d\nWorried for his own safety, Mr. Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.\nMr. Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: \u201cThe path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.\u201d\nFollow Javier C.

For This Reporter, Too.\nWhen the investigative journalist Matt Apuzzo moved from Washington to Brussels, he noticed that distrust had a different focus. And he adjusted some of his own tech tools.\nHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Matt Apuzzo, an investigative correspondent in Brussels, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nWhat are the most important tech tools for you as an investigative journalist?\nAs with most people these days, my go-to device is my phone, which in my case is an iPhone X. I don\u2019t use it for anything particularly unique to journalism, except maybe document scanning. Sometimes, I might have only a minute to see a key document, and having it can mean the difference between breaking a story and not. For years I have used an app called TurboScan Pro, and I love it.\nTech is great, but there\u2019s no substitute for personal relationships. I prefer face-to-face conversations whenever possible, and I almost never record them. I use small, discreet notebooks like the Moleskine pocket journal. A lot of my interviews are over coffee, drinks or meals, and I want something as unobtrusive as possible at the table. I love the feel of the Rhodia pocket webnotebook, but let\u2019s be honest: I\u2019m not picky. Some of the best, most surprising nuggets of information have been scribbled on napkins or the backs of envelopes or tapped in text messages to myself.\nI try to transcribe long interviews immediately. I have been a longtime devotee of the web-based app Workflowy for taking notes, at the recommendation of my colleague Farhad Manjoo. It\u2019s particularly great for long-term projects and collaborations. I recently downloaded and am trying out the app Bear at the recommendation of another colleague, Kate Conger. My dream piece of note-taking software has a lightweight, fast interface that supports tagging and annotation of PDFs. I\u2019ve tried Evernote and OneNote but found both to be too bloated for my purposes. The quest continues.\nI use a MacBook Pro, which I like for its full-disk encryption. But it devours battery life. Maybe it\u2019s just my device, but it loses 50 percent of its charge while sleeping overnight, and Apple says there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. So I followed the lead of another colleague, Eric Lipton, and invested in a power pack that can recharge both my Mac and my phone. I picked a unit from ZDI because Wirecutter recommended it, and I\u2019m quite happy with it.\nWhen I travel, it all gets tossed into an Everyday Max Backpack, which opens and packs like a roll aboard but carries like a slim backpack and includes a separate laptop compartment. All the cables are kept in check with the Grid-It organization system.\nHow do you keep communications with sources secure?\nBefore moving to Europe this summer, I spent about a decade covering national security and intelligence in cities like Washington, so I\u2019m pretty security conscious. Before I left, a friend who works in intelligence offered a gentle reminder that most countries would probably consider me fair game for intelligence collection.\nSo I use a cheap Chromebook when traveling to places where curious eyes might be tempted to sneak a peek. I set it up with a burner account, and I never connect it to any personal or business accounts.\nAnd all those note-taking apps? If I\u2019m working on something particularly sensitive or talking to someone who is sticking his neck out by meeting with me, those notes often don\u2019t get saved digitally. When the story is done, the notebook gets tossed and that\u2019s the end of it.\nFor my phone, I appreciate Apple\u2019s encryption standards. I don\u2019t appreciate having to turn off all the location-based corporate surveillance on my iPhone, but nothing is perfect.\nFor text-based conversations, I use mostly Signal and WhatsApp. But as President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort reminded us all: End-to-end encryption is useless if you\u2019re backing up chats to the cloud. So I don\u2019t.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest difference you\u2019ve noticed in how Europeans use tech versus Americans?\nThe biggest difference seems to be one of trust. Speaking generally, Europeans seem far more suspicious of private companies and far more trusting of their governments. Americans don\u2019t trust the government with their data, but will click \u201cO.K.\u201d to allow companies to mine their personal lives and sell their information to any number of unsavory buyers. Again this is a generalization, but the idea that companies can secretly use your personal information to manipulate you seems much more unsettling to Europeans than the knowledge that the government is tracking subway rides and videotaping city streets.\nAnd tech-savvy countries like Estonia are innovating in ways that make government more efficient. When you see Estonia\u2019s \u201conly once\u201d policy \u2014 the promise that you\u2019ll never have to give the government a piece of information more than once \u2014 it\u2019s hard not to view the United States and all of its paper as slow and outdated. Age, sex, address, date of birth, employer, phone number: How many times have you scratched them on a piece of paper for a different bureaucrat in a different office in a different wing of the American bureaucracy?\nWhat are the most important tech tools now for you and your family in keeping touch with folks back home?\nThe move has been pretty seamless, techwise. I\u2019m on WhatsApp with my family and friends and Signal with my colleagues, just as before. I ported my Washington cell number to Tossable Digits, a service that forwards calls to my Brussels number and forwards text messages to my email address. It\u2019s nice to keep an American number handy.\nYou won\u2019t find me on Facebook. I pulled the plug and don\u2019t miss it at all.\nAnd I\u2019m almost three years clean on Twitter, which was a much harder break. But I noticed it was really hurting my attention span. Plus, it just felt like an endless version of the worst kind of cocktail party. Only with Nazis. So many Nazis. I\u2019m still there as @mattapuzzo, though, because a colleague told me that if I deleted the account it would be taken over by sex bots.\nAnd nobody wants that.\nMatt Apuzzo is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter based in Washington.

In a blaze of propaganda, the police accused him and other combative attorneys of disrupting trials, fanning discontent, and plotting to overthrow the Communist Party.\nBut while others detained in the crackdown were released with warnings, put on bail after making rehearsed confessions on television, or tried and sentenced, Mr. Wang remained held in secrecy. His trial was also swaddled in security to ward off protests.\n\u201cThis whole process has been illegal, so how could I expect an open and fair trial?\u201d Mr. Wang\u2019s wife, Li Wenzu, said in a telephone interview before the hearing. \u201cBut my demand is still that he be freed as not guilty, because that\u2019s what he is.\u201d\nThe police and guards kept Ms. Li from leaving her apartment in Beijing to attend the trial in Tianjin, a port city about 65 miles southeast from her home in the capital. During Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, the authorities rejected repeated attempts by her and a succession of attorneys to visit him or find out more about his status and health.\nThe mobile phone of Liu Weiguo, the lawyer who represented Mr. Wang at the trial was turned off on Wednesday evening, and it was unclear when the trial ended. But the Tianjin Second Intermediate People\u2019s Court that heard the case said on its website that a verdict would be announced at a later date. \u201cBecause state secrets were involved, the court decided under the law not to hold a public trial,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cThis will be a show trial, carefully censored and tightly controlled,\u201d said Terence Halliday, a research professor at the American Bar Foundation in Chicago who studies Chinese defense lawyers. \u201cThrough Wang Quanzhang\u2019s protracted disappearance, China\u2019s state security and public security have been sending a chilling message to activist lawyers \u2014 keep silent or this could be your fate too.\u201d\nStill, one detail slipped out from the secret proceedings that suggested Mr. Wang remained unbowed. While in the courtroom, he dismissed his lawyer, Mr. Liu, who was not chosen by his family, Ms. Li said, citing a message from Mr. Liu. That step may have forced an adjournment in the trial, but Ms. Li had no further details.\nMr. Wang\u2019s case, though, has been overshadowed this year by other controversies in China as Xi Jinping, the party leader and president, has sought to extinguish potential threats to party rule.\nHundreds of thousands of Muslims in Xinjiang, a northwest region, have been detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to renounce their religious beliefs and pledge loyalty to the party. Several independent Protestant churches have been shut down, and an outspoken pastor of one was detained. Two Canadians have been detained and accused of threatening national security in what supporters say was reprisal for a Chinese telecommunications executive\u2019s arrest in Canada.\nThe detentions of lawyers and advocates in 2015 were a turning point on the way to more hard-line policies, said experts and friends of Mr. Wang. His prolonged detention came to symbolize the Communist Party\u2019s growing readiness to override promised legal protections if they got in the way of silencing perceived threats, they said.\n\u201cThe mass detention and surveillance campaign and other persecution in Xinjiang are the worst examples we know of at the moment, but they are connected to what is going on more widely in China,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London who studies China\u2019s human rights lawyers and knows Mr. Wang. \u201cHuman rights defenders are very openly characterized as enemies of the people, connected to other, outside enemies.\u201d\nIn the face of official pressure and rebuffs, Ms. Li and the families of other detained lawyers coalesced into a determined and creative resistance.\nThey have protested using red buckets, attempted walking to the detention center where Mr. Wang was held, and this month they shaved their heads to protest what they said was judges\u2019 failure to enforce Mr. Wang\u2019s rights under Chinese law. (The Mandarin Chinese word for hair (fa) sounds similar to the word for law.)\n\u201cIn Chinese, having no hair sounds like having no law,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cWe meant that we can do without our hair, but we can\u2019t do without law.\u201d\nThe prosecutors\u2019 allegations against Mr. Wang appeared to distill several themes that the government has used to attack China\u2019s human rights lawyers as a whole.\nThey accused him of \u201cstirring up trouble\u201d by calling together lawyers and supporters to demand that detainees be freed; of maligning China\u2019s legal system online while representing members of a banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong; and colluding with a foreign-funded group to \u201cpropagate methods and tricks for resisting the government,\u201d according to a 2017 prosecutors\u2019 document shared by Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights advocate named in the allegations.\nMr. Dahlin, who was detained in Beijing for 23 days in 2016 and deported from China for his work helping rights activists, said he was sure the document was authentic and rejected the claim that Mr. Wang\u2019s activities amounted to \u201csubversion of state power.\u201d\nMr. Wang was born in Shandong Province, east China, and was drawn to activism even before he had graduated from law school. Like many other Chinese attorneys who take on contentious cases, his clients were mostly ordinary citizens in disputes with officials over land seizures, detentions and police abuses.\nEven more than most rights lawyers, he has a stubborn streak, his wife and friends said.\nHis unbending personality probably \u201ckept him going through years of abusive, incommunicado detention and given him the strength to refuse a forced confession,\u201d Michael Caster, a human rights advocate who formerly worked in Beijing with Mr. Wang, said by email. \u201cHe was never one to be intimidated by threats from judges or by the physical abuse of police.\u201d\nWhen asked about Mr. Wang and others detained in the 2015 crackdown, Chinese officials have said that they have been given all their legal rights. But legal experts have said that his long, secretive confinement and lack of access to his own lawyers flouted China\u2019s laws. In October, a United Nations Human Rights Council group condemned the secretive detention of Mr. Wang and two other Chinese advocates as a violation of international laws.\nChinese courts come under the guidance of the Communist Party and rarely, if ever, find defendants innocent in politically charged cases. Some of his supporters said Mr. Wang could be given a suspended prison sentence like other some lawyers who were detained in 2015. But others were less hopeful of early release.\n\u201cEven though Quanzhang is innocent, the outlook is bleak,\u201d said Xie Yanyi, a recently disbarred Chinese rights attorney who tried to attend Mr. Wang\u2019s trial. \u201cWang Quanzhang\u2019s wife and loved ones need to be mentally prepared.\u201d\nMr. Xie said he was blocked by plain clothes officers from trying to reach the court in Tianjin and supporters who got near the courthouse were bundled away by the police, said reporters there.\nMr. Wang\u2019s wife, Ms. Li, said that until he was detained she knew little about his work. But she has since become a savvy advocate for her husband while trying to protect their 6-year old son. In a public letter in July addressed to Mr. Wang, she said she told their son that his father had gone off to battle monsters.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go help dad fight the monsters,\u201d the son told a friend, Ms. Li wrote. \u201cAfter they\u2019re beaten, dad can come home.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/world/asia/china-wang-quanzhang-lawyer-trial.html", "tags": [{"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.92548"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.45524"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.15585"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.12311"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.09942"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.08713"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.08209"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.08174"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.07703"}, {"label": "political prisoners", "score": "0.06835"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.05661"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.05478"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.04928"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.04722"}, {"label": "arson", "score": "0.04148"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.04086"}, {"label": "sentences (criminal)", "score": "0.03809"}, {"label": "trials", "score": "0.03550"}, {"label": "bail", "score": "0.03521"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.03371"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.03369"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.03158"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.02990"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.02811"}, {"label": "torture", "score": "0.02726"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.02551"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02551"}, {"label": "fires and firefighters", "score": "0.02531"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.02473"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02227"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["China", "Beijing", "Tianjin", "Chicago", "China", "China", "Xinjiang", "Canada", "Xinjiang", "China", "China", "China", "China", "Beijing", "China", "Shandong Province", "China", "Beijing", "China", "Quanzhang", "Tianjin"], "ORG": ["China Holds Secret Trial for Rights Lawyer", "the Communist Party", "the Communist Party", "the Tianjin Second Intermediate People\u2019s Court", "the American Bar Foundation", "the Communist Party\u2019s", "King\u2019s College London", "United Nations Human Rights Council", "the Communist Party"], "PERSON": ["Wang Quanzhang", "Wang", "Wang", "Wang", "Li Wenzu", "Li", "Wang", "Liu Weiguo", "Wang", "Terence Halliday", "Wang Quanzhang\u2019s", "Wang", "Liu", "Li", "Liu", "Li", "Wang", "Xi Jinping", "Wang", "Eva Pils", "Wang", "Li", "Wang", "Wang", "fa", "Li", "Wang", "Falun Gong", "Peter Dahlin", "Dahlin", "Wang", "Wang", "Michael Caster", "Wang", "Wang", "Wang", "Wang", "Xie Yanyi", "Wang", "Wang Quanzhang\u2019s", "Xie", "Wang", "Li", "Wang", "Li"]}}, {"index": 38, "year": 2018, "title": "\u2018It\u2019s an Act of Murder\u2019: How Europe Outsources Suffering as Migrants Drown", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/26/opinion/europe-migrant-crisis-mediterranean-libya.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "On Nov. 6, 2017, at least 20 people trying to reach Europe from Libya drowned in the Mediterranean, foundering next to a sinking raft.\nNot far from the raft was a ship belonging to Sea-Watch, a German humanitarian organization. That ship had enough space on it for everyone who had been aboard the raft. It could have brought them all to the safety of Europe, where they might have had a chance at being granted asylum.\nInstead, 20 people drowned and 47 more were captured by the Libyan Coast Guard, which brought the migrants back to Libya, where they suffered abuse \u2014 including rape and torture.\nThis confrontation at sea was not a simplistic case of Europe versus Africa, with human rights and rescue on one side and chaos and danger on the other. Rather it\u2019s a case of Europe versus Europe: of volunteers struggling to save lives being undercut by European Union policies that outsource border control responsibilities to the Libyan Coast Guard \u2014 with the aim of stemming arrivals on European shores.\nWhile funding, equipping and directing the Libyan Coast Guard, European governments have stymied the activities of nongovernmental organizations like Sea-Watch, criminalizing them or impounding their ships, or turning away from ports ships carrying survivors.\nMore than 14,000 people have died or gone missing while trying to cross the central Mediterranean since 2014. But unlike most of those deaths and drownings, the incident on Nov. 6, 2017, was extensively documented.\nSea-Watch\u2019s ship and rescue rafts were outfitted with nine cameras, documenting the entire scene in video and audio. The Libyans, too, filmed parts of the incident on their mobile phones.\nThe research groups Forensic Architecture and Forensic Oceanography of Goldsmiths, University of London, of which three of us \u2014 Mr. Heller, Mr. Pezzani and Mr. Weizman \u2014 are a part, combined these video sources with radio recordings, vessel tracking data, witness testimonies and newly obtained official sources to produce a minute-by-minute reconstruction of the facts. Opinion Video at The New York Times built on this work to create the above short documentary, gathering further testimonials by some of the survivors and rescuers who were there.\nThis investigation makes a few things clear: European governments are avoiding their legal and moral responsibilities to protect the human rights of people fleeing violence and economic desperation. More worrying, the Libyan Coast Guard partners that Europe is collaborating with are ready to blatantly violate those rights if it allows them to prevent migrants from crossing the sea.\nStopping Migrants, Whatever the Cost\nTo understand the cynicism of Europe\u2019s policies in the Mediterranean, one must understand the legal context. According to a 2012 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, migrants rescued by European civilian or military vessels must be taken to a safe port. Because of the chaotic political situation in Libya and well-documented human rights abuses in detention camps there, that means a European port, often in Italy or Malta.\nBut when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepts migrants, even outside Libyan territorial waters, as it did on Nov. 6, the Libyans take them back to detention camps in Libya, which is not subject to European Court of Human Rights jurisdiction.\nFor Italy \u2014 and Europe \u2014 this is an ideal situation. Europe is able to stop people from reaching its shores while washing its hands of any responsibility for their safety.\nThis policy can be traced back to February 2017, when Italy and the United Nations-supported Libyan Government of National Accord signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that provided a framework for collaboration on development, to fight against \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d human trafficking and the smuggling of contraband. This agreement defines clearly the aim, \u201cto stem the illegal migrants\u2019 flows,\u201d and committed Italy to provide \u201ctechnical and technological support to the Libyan institutions in charge of the fight against illegal immigration.\u201d\nLibyan Coast Guard members have been trained by the European Union, and the Italian government donated or repaired several patrol boats and supported the establishment of a Libyan search-and-rescue zone. Libyan authorities have since attempted \u2014 in defiance of maritime law \u2014 to make that zone off-limits to nongovernmental organizations\u2019 rescue vessels. Italian Navy ships, based in Tripoli, have coordinated Libyan Coast Guard efforts.\nBefore these arrangements, Libyan actors were able to intercept and return very few migrants leaving from Libyan shores. Now the Libyan Coast Guard is an efficient partner, having intercepted some 20,000 people in 2017 alone.\nThe Libyan Coast Guard is efficient when it comes to stopping migrants from reaching Europe. It\u2019s not as good, however, at saving their lives, as the events of Nov. 6 show.\nA Deadly Policy in Action\nThat morning the migrant raft had encountered worsening conditions after leaving Tripoli, Libya, over night. Someone onboard used a satellite phone to call the Italian Coast Guard for help.\nBecause the Italians were required by law to alert nearby vessels of the sinking raft, they alerted Sea-Watch to its approximate location. But they also requested the intervention of their Libyan counterparts.\nThe Libyan Coast Guard vessel that was sent to intervene on that morning, the Ras Jadir, was one of several that had been repaired by Italy and handed back to the Libyans in May of 2017. Eight of the 13 crew members onboard had received training from the European Union anti-smuggling naval program known as Operation Sophia.\nEven so, the Libyans brought the Ras Jadir next to the migrants\u2019 raft, rather than deploying a smaller rescue vessel, as professional rescuers do. This offered no hope of rescuing those who had already fallen overboard and only caused more chaos, during which at least five people died.\nThese deaths were not merely a result of a lack of professionalism. Some of the migrants who had been brought aboard the Ras Jadir were so afraid of their fate at the hands of the Libyans that they jumped back into the water to try to reach the European rescuers. As can be seen in the footage, members of the Libyan Coast Guard beat the remaining migrants.\nSea-Watch\u2019s crew was also attacked by the Libyan Coast Guard, who threatened them and threw hard objects at them to keep them away. This eruption of violence was the result of a clash between the goals of rescue and interception, with the migrants caught in the middle desperately struggling for their lives.\nApart from those who died during this chaos, more than 15 people had already drowned in the time spent waiting for any rescue vessel to appear.\nThere was, however, no shortage of potential rescuers in the area: A Portuguese surveillance plane had located the migrants\u2019 raft after its distress call. An Italian Navy helicopter and a French frigate were nearby and eventually offered some support during the rescue.\nIt\u2019s possible that this French ship, deployed as part of Operation Sophia, could have reached the sinking vessel earlier, in time to save more lives \u2014 despite our requests, this information has not been disclosed to us. But it remained at a distance throughout the incident and while offering some support, notably refrained from taking migrants onboard who would then have had to have been disembarked on European soil. It\u2019s an example of a hands-off approach that seeks to make Libyan intervention not only possible but also inevitable.\nA Legal Challenge\nOn the basis of the forensic reconstruction, the Global Legal Action Network and the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration, with the support of Yale Law School students, have filed a case against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights representing 17 survivors of this incident.\nThose working on the suit, who include two of us \u2014 Mr. Mann and Ms. Moreno-Lax \u2014 argue that even though Italian or European personnel did not physically intercept the migrants and bring them back to Libya, Italy exercised effective control over the Libyan Coast Guard through mutual agreements, support and on-the-ground coordination. Italy has entrusted the Libyans with a task that Rome knows full well would be illegal if undertaken directly: preventing migrants from seeking protection in Europe by impeding their flight and sending them back to a country where extreme violence and exploitation await.\nWe hope this legal complaint will lead the European court to rule that countries cannot subcontract their legal and humanitarian obligations to dubious partners, and that if they do, they retain responsibility for the resulting violations. Such a precedent would force the entire European Union to make sure its cooperation with partners like Libya does not end up denying refugees the right to seek asylum.\nThis case is especially important right now. In Italy\u2019s elections in March, the far-right Lega party, which campaigned on radical anti-immigrant rhetoric, took nearly 20 percent of the vote. The party is now part of the governing coalition, of which its leader, Matteo Salvini, is the interior minister.\nHis government has doubled down on animosity toward migrants. In June, Italy took the drastic step of turning away a humanitarian vessel from the country\u2019s ports and has been systematically blocking rescued migrants from being disembarked since then, even when they had been assisted by the Italian Coast Guard.\nThe Italian crackdown helps explain why seafarers off the Libyan coast have refrained from assisting migrants in distress, leaving them to drift for days. Under the new Italian government, a new batch of patrol boats has been handed over to the Libyan Coast Guard, and the rate of migrants being intercepted and brought back to Libya has increased. All this has made the crossing even more dangerous than before.\nItaly has been seeking to enact a practice that blatantly violates the spirit of the Geneva Convention on refugees, which enshrines the right to seek asylum and prohibits sending people back to countries in which their lives are at risk. A judgment by the European Court sanctioning Italy for this practice would help prevent the outsourcing of border control and human rights violations that may prevent the world\u2019s most disempowered populations from seeking protection and dignity.\nThe European Court of Human Rights cannot stand alone as a guardian of fundamental rights.

May, Early Advocate of Internet Privacy, Dies at 66\nTimothy C. May, a physicist, polemicist and cantankerous advocate of internet privacy who helped start a movement aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals online, died on Dec. 13 at his home in Corralitos, Calif. He was 66.\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff-Coroner\u2019s office confirmed his death but said that the cause had not yet been determined.\nAs the rabble-rousing leader of a group called the Cypherpunks, Mr. May, in his writings, foreshadowed and influenced many of the concerns about privacy and government control that have come to dominate the internet age.\nIn the one-page Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which he wrote in 1988, Mr. May said, \u201cJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.\u201d\nMuch of Mr. May\u2019s writing, incorporating elements of advanced math, libertarian politics and even science fiction, was circulated by the Cypherpunks, a group he co-founded with John Gilmore and Eric Hughes in 1992. It inspired later online movements like WikiLeaks and cryptocurrency technologies like Bitcoin.\nIn recent years, Mr. May\u2019s legacy had been clouded by his frequent and unapologetically offensive statements in online forums. In 2003 he wrote that he would welcome a nuclear strike on Washington because it would kill \u201ca million criminal politicians and two million inner-city welfare mutants.\u201d\nHis friends said that his troublesome views were an outgrowth of the style that had made him so influential.\n\u201cHe would try to get people\u2019s attention by saying things in a deliberately confrontational way,\u201d said Mr. Gilmore, who later co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.\nOnce he got someone\u2019s attention, Mr. May was interested in having an honest conversation, Mr. Gilmore said. \u201cHe actually cared about the truth and about coming to understand things,\u201d he said.\nTimothy Christopher May was born on Dec. 21, 1951, in Bethesda, Md. His father, Thomas, was in the Navy, and the family moved frequently, to California, Virginia and France. His mother, Hazel (Heden) May, was a homemaker.\nMr. May\u2019s sister, Kathleen Fox, said his unquenchable intellectual curiosity was always combined with a defiant streak. After being accepted into Mensa, the high I.Q. society, and attending its meetings, Mr. May told her that the members were a \u201cbunch of dummies\u201d and that they weren\u2019t worth his time.\nMr. May studied physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. On graduating he took a job at Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of computer chips, which had been founded a few years earlier.\nOnly several years into the job, after the company\u2019s chips had been found to be malfunctioning, Mr. May discovered the source of the problem through a process involving radioactive alpha particles. His discovery earned him his own laboratory and an award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. But calculating that his Intel stock options could sustain him through retirement, he resigned at 34.\nMr. May set out to write a science fiction novel inspired by the evolving science of cryptography and the writings of libertarians like Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. When he struggled to bring off the novel, he turned to writing on early online forums run by groups like the Extropians and his own Cypherpunks.\nAs the Cypherpunks\u2019 most frequent contributor, and at the group\u2019s in-person meetings in the Bay Area, Mr. May advocated using cryptography to spread government secrets, as WikiLeaks later did, and to evade surveillance of individuals, which he believed would become more pervasive with the spread of computers.\nThese ideas brought the Cypherpunks into conflict with the government, which wanted to limit the spread of cryptography. But people who successfully fought to integrate cryptography into the internet in its early days, to protect the privacy of individuals, hailed Mr. May\u2019s writing as an inspiration.\n\u201cHe was ahead of the game and understood what was going to be happening and what these obscure technologies were going to bring about,\u201d said Steven Levy, who wrote about Mr. May extensively in the 1990s for Wired magazine and in the book \u201cCrypto\u201d (2001).\nIn addition to Ms. Fox, Mr. May is survived by his brother, Michael.\nMr. May kept a careful distance from the real world, leading a reclusive life. He often wrote about arming himself and waiting for government agents to show up. After the Cypherpunks faded in the early 2000s, he began expressing racist sentiments to other online groups.\nDespite alienating many of his old allies, some of his ideas have recently come into vogue again with the rise of WikiLeaks and Bitcoin and the growing concerns about government surveillance.\nIn an interview in October with the website CoinDesk, Mr. May accused social media companies of helping to \u201cbuild the machinery of the Dossier Society,\u201d in which private citizens\u2019 personal information can be monitored and sold. He was also critical of the get-rich-quick mentality of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\u201cI cannot give a ringing endorsement to where we are,\u201d he told CoinDesk, \u201cor generate a puff-piece about the great things already done.\u201d\nSusan Beachy contributed reporting.\nSusan Beachy contributed reporting.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/obituaries/timothy-c-may-dead.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.67289"}, {"label": "deaths (obituaries)", "score": "0.44429"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.26056"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.23344"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.07236"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.07011"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.03962"}, {"label": "privacy", "score": "0.03751"}, {"label": "deaths", "score": "0.03406"}, {"label": "internet and world wide web", "score": "0.02264"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.02072"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.01927"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.01721"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.01689"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.01576"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01457"}, {"label": "suicides and suicide attempts", "score": "0.01414"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01413"}, {"label": "writing and writers", "score": "0.01354"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.01164"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01060"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01034"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.00876"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00795"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.00789"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.00749"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.00714"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.00670"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00669"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00659"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Corralitos", "Calif.", "Santa Cruz County", "Washington", "Bethesda", "Md.", "California", "Virginia", "France", "Heden", "I.Q.", "Santa Barbara"], "ORG": ["Cypherpunks", "WikiLeaks", "the Electronic Frontier Foundation", "Navy", "Mensa", "the University of California", "Intel", "the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "Intel", "WikiLeaks", "Wired", "Cypherpunks", "WikiLeaks", "the Dossier Society"], "PERSON": ["Timothy C.

More Like Watching It Go With a Sigh\nThe diapers ad that shows up on your computer when you are expecting a child. The coupon on your smartphone for a fast-food chain you just walked past. The sneaker offer appearing in your mailbox after you sign up to run a race.\nFor years, marketers and technology companies have crept further into the homes and habits of Americans, arguing all the while that there is a fair and voluntary exchange taking place. The more we know about you, the argument goes, the more we can show you products you actually want instead of ads that just annoy you. Consumers, they say, are happily trading very specific information about their lives in order to receive this kind of personalized advertising and marketing \u2014 relevant ads, as the industry calls them.\nJoseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the topic for years and vigorously disagrees with that interpretation. Research by Professor Turow and his colleagues has found that most Americans give up data for relevant ads not because of convenience, but resignation. Rather than participating in a rational exchange, he argues, consumers are giving up their personal information with \u201ca feeling of futility.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are very uncomfortable with surveillance, but they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Professor Turow said about the research, which involved a telephone survey of about 1,500 people across the country this year and in 2015. \u201cIn the real world, not having a frequent shopper card at the supermarket means you\u2019re going to lose 15 to 20 percent on purchases. It\u2019s very difficult for people to give up Facebook if all their friends are on Facebook.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s that calculus people have, rather than, geez, this is a rational decision I\u2019m making because I know this is what I have to do.\u201d\nProfessor Turow is among the academics, privacy advocates and regulators who have long been critical of how companies extricate vast amounts of personal information from consumers in the digital world. In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be.\nThis year has seen a string of revelations about how Facebook mishandled data from its users, even sharing their private messages with large corporations like Spotify and Netflix. Tech executives have regularly appeared before Congress and been grilled about their companies\u2019 practices. European lawmakers passed a sweeping privacy law in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R. That was followed by a California state law on privacy, which its advocates hoped would serve as a model for the nation.\nNew questions emerged around how Google allows outside companies to scan and share data from consumers\u2019 Gmail accounts. Companies were found to be using our smartphones to watch our every step. The rise of internet-connected devices in the home has turned everything from televisions to children\u2019s thermometers into tools for targeted advertising. And that\u2019s just a sampling.\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe topic didn\u2019t suddenly materialize this year \u2014 The Wall Street Journal broke major ground on digital surveillance with its award-winning series \u201cWhat They Know\u201d in 2010.\nBut at that time Facebook was not yet public and Google was a fraction of its current size. Digital tracking has since become far more pervasive and intertwined with peoples\u2019 daily lives \u2014 advertisements follow them from their computers to their phones and even their TVs \u2014 and often, it can feel inescapable. Recently, Facebook told Gizmodo that even if people opt out of location sharing with the social network, it can still determine their location and use it for targeted advertising.\n\u201cThere are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit \u2014 they admit \u2014 that they aren\u2019t written for the public.\u201d\nIn their survey this year, researchers led by Professor Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: \u201cIf a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won\u2019t share user information with other sites or companies without permission.\u201d (The statement is false.)\nThe researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, extends only to children who are 12 and under.\n\u201cI would argue that\u2019s because people can\u2019t imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,\u201d Professor Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and this year, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.\nThe findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze.\nAdvertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.\nStill, little has been said publicly. While some ad agency executives have criticized Facebook in recent weeks, other executives have sought to neutralize those remarks. Last month, Rishad Tobaccowala, the chief growth officer of the advertising firm Publicis Groupe, questioned Facebook\u2019s moral compass in an interview with The New York Times. Shortly afterward, Facebook distributed more conciliatory comments from Arthur Sadoun, the chief executive of Publicis. Mr. Sadoun acknowledged the company\u2019s issues but added, \u201cWe believe that the management is taking the right decisions that are going in the right direction.\u201d\nA similar reaction emerged after the chief executive of the agency Initiative said in a LinkedIn post that he would advise his clients to halt advertising on Facebook based on its \u201cegregious behavior\u201d involving consumer data. Michael Roth, the chief executive of the Interpublic Group, which owns Initiative, quickly told The Wall Street Journal that the company would continue to \u201cwork closely with our media partners,\u201d including Facebook.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cThe question is: What do you do about it?\"", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/business/media/data-sharing-deals-privacy.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.63231"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.59790"}, {"label": "advertising", "score": "0.18577"}, {"label": "marketing and merchandising", "score": "0.14364"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.11411"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.07815"}, {"label": "apparel", "score": "0.04186"}, {"label": "retail stores and trade", "score": "0.03092"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03029"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.02805"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.02591"}, {"label": "consumer behavior", "score": "0.02242"}, {"label": "colleges and universities", "score": "0.02139"}, {"label": "prices (fares, fees and rates)", "score": "0.01945"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.01906"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01852"}, {"label": "animals", "score": "0.01742"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.01710"}, {"label": "age, chronological", "score": "0.01628"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.01511"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01407"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.01399"}, {"label": "design", "score": "0.01294"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01244"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01217"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01173"}, {"label": "data processing (computers)", "score": "0.01162"}, {"label": "housing", "score": "0.01082"}, {"label": "theater", "score": "0.01073"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.01067"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["California"], "ORG": ["the Annenberg School for Communication", "the University of Pennsylvania", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Spotify", "Netflix", "Congress", "the General Data Protection Regulation", "Google", "Gmail", "Facebook", "Google", "The Wall Street Journal", "Facebook", "Google", "Digital", "Facebook", "Gizmodo", "the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Google", "Gmail", "YouTube", "Waze", "Facebook", "Publicis Groupe", "Facebook", "The New York Times", "Facebook", "Publicis", "Initiative", "Facebook", "the Interpublic Group", "Initiative", "The Wall Street Journal", "Facebook"], "PERSON": ["Joseph Turow", "Turow", "Turow", "Turow", "Steve Satterfield", "Turow", "Turow", "Turow", "Rishad Tobaccowala", "Arthur Sadoun", "Sadoun", "Michael Roth", "Turow"]}}, {"index": 41, "year": 2018, "title": "Starting Over by Learning the Language of Dogs", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/neediest-cases/dog-trainer.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "Supported by\nStarting Over by Learning the Language of Dogs\nRoyah Nu\u00f1ez used to sit on the floor of a Barnes & Noble bookstore for hours, reading about dog training.\n\u201cI always did my own research,\u201d she said.\nMs. Nu\u00f1ez, 27, loved animals from a young age and wanted to be a veterinarian.

The complaint accuses him of conspiring with members of the religious group Lev Tahor to kidnap the siblings and take them south of the border.\nMr. Rosner, 45, is the brother of one of the group\u2019s leaders, who was also involved in the kidnapping plan, according to the complaint.\nThe men were part of a group of at least six co-conspirators who worked to bring the children to Lev Tahor\u2019s community in Guatemala, the complaint said.\nOn Friday morning, the children were recovered in Mexico, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, and plans were underway to reunite them with their mother.\nLev Tahor, which translates to \u201cpure heart\u201d in Hebrew, is an offshoot of an anti-Zionist Hasidic sect. Members of the group practice a strict form of Orthodox Judaism. The group reportedly eschews technology and requires its female members to wear black robes from head to toe. Critics call the group a \u201ccult.\u201d\nThe group started in Jerusalem in the 1980s. The rabbi who formed the sect, Shlomo Helbrans, relocated them to a Brooklyn yeshiva in 1990.\nOver the years, children in Lev Tahor have often been subjected to \u201cphysical, sexual and emotional abuse,\u201d according to the complaint. Mr. Helbrans was himself arrested in New York in 1993 on charges that he kidnapped a teenager who was then studying with the rabbi in preparation for his bar mitzvah. The boy\u2019s parents accused Mr. Helbrans of brainwashing their son; Mr. Helbrans accused the parents of abusing their son.\nMr. Helbrans was found guilty of kidnapping and served two years in prison. He was released on parole in 1996 and was deported to Israel in 2000. The rabbi and his followers then established a Lev Tahor community in Quebec, Canada, in the early 2000s. After legal troubles there involving allegations of child abuse and child marriages, members of the group left Canada and eventually resettled in Guatemala.\nBefore the kidnapping, the children and their mother were part of the religious community in Guatemala, according to the complaint, when the mother, who is also Mr. Helbrans\u2019s daughter, decided to leave the group and move to Woodridge, N.Y., in October of this year.\nA new leader had taken charge of Lev Tahor, and the group had become more extreme, according to the complaint. The woman spoke out against changes in the group, the complaint said. Then she decided her children would no longer be safe if they stayed with Lev Tahor.\nAbout six weeks after the move, in the early hours of Dec. 8, Yante Teller, 14, and her 12-year-old brother, Chaim, got into a vehicle in front of their home in Woodridge and were driven away. The State Police asked the public\u2019s help in finding the children, saying they were believed to be headed to New York City.\nTheir ultimate destination was much farther. Mr. Rosner worked with several people across the United States, Mexico and Guatemala to try to return the siblings to the Lev Tahor community in Guatemala, the complaint said.\nThe children were taken to an airport outside Scranton, Pa., where surveillance footage showed them being ushered through airport security by a man whom the complaint does not identify. Days later, the children were in Mexico, the complaint said.\nIt remained unclear Thursday how the children were found in Mexico. The Department of Justice said it could not comment on their whereabouts. The State Police referred questions about the investigation to the F.B.I. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on nonemergency matters because of staffing plans related to the federal government shutdown.\nAround the time of the kidnapping, Mr. Rosner sent seven wire transfers to a man in Mexico, according to the complaint. He also organized multiple conference calls with co-conspirators in the kidnapping and spoke with them about hotels in Mexico, flights, bus tickets, credit cards and food, the complaint said.\nHe was detained pending trial as of Thursday afternoon, the Justice Department said.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/nyregion/lev-tahor-cult-kidnapping.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.94867"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.83261"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.72234"}, {"label": "hasidism", "score": "0.39496"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.25290"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.17851"}, {"label": "religious cults", "score": "0.15618"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.04889"}, {"label": "christians and christianity", "score": "0.03030"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.02970"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02841"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02236"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.02157"}, {"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.01507"}, {"label": "fringe groups and movements", "score": "0.01385"}, {"label": "spanish language", "score": "0.01201"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01114"}, {"label": "embezzlement", "score": "0.01001"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.00951"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.00842"}, {"label": "minorities (us)", "score": "0.00819"}, {"label": "blacks (in us)", "score": "0.00809"}, {"label": "extortion and blackmail", "score": "0.00760"}, {"label": "anti-semitism", "score": "0.00715"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00696"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00671"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.00632"}, {"label": "social conditions and trends", "score": "0.00594"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.00578"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00576"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Brooklyn", "Mexico", "New York", "New York City", "Mexico", "White Plains", "N.Y.", "Brooklyn", "Guatemala", "Mexico", "U.S.", "Jerusalem", "New York", "Israel", "Quebec", "Canada", "Canada", "Guatemala", "Guatemala", "Woodridge", "N.Y.", "Woodridge", "New York City", "the United States", "Mexico", "Guatemala", "Guatemala", "Scranton", "Pa.", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico", "Mexico"], "ORG": ["Federal District Court", "The State Police", "The Department of Justice", "The State Police", "F.B.I.", "the Justice Department"], "PERSON": ["Aron Rosner", "Lev Tahor", "Rosner", "Lev Tahor", "Lev Tahor", "Shlomo Helbrans", "Lev Tahor", "Helbrans", "Helbrans", "Helbrans", "Helbrans", "Lev Tahor", "Helbrans", "Lev Tahor", "Lev Tahor", "Yante Teller", "Chaim", "Rosner", "Lev Tahor", "Rosner"]}}, {"index": 43, "year": 2018, "title": "The Spy Who Spied on Spies", "url": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/21/specials/lecarre-tinker.html", "text_content": "|\n|\nJune 30, 1974The Spy Who Spied on Spies\nBy RICHARD LOCKE\nTINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY\nBy John Le Carr\u00e9.\nohn Le Carr\u00e9 new book -- his seventh in thirteen years -- is a thoroughly enjoyable English spy novel about the discovery of a double agent at the highest level of the British Intelligence bureaucracy. It reconfirms the impression that Le Carr\u00e9 belongs to the select company of such spy and detective story writers as Arthur Conan Doyle and Graham Greene in England and Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald in America. There are those who read crime and espionage books for the plot and those who read them for the atmosphere; the former talk of \"ingenious puzzles\" and take pride in \"pure ratiocination\"; the latter think themselves more literary, worry about style and characterization, and tend to praise their favorite writers as \"real novelists.\" Le Carr\u00e9's books -- like those of the six authors just mentioned -- offer plenty for both kinds of readers.\n\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" is fluently written; it is full of vivid character sketches of secret agents and bureaucrats from all levels of British society , and the dialogue catches their voices well. The social and physical details of English life and the day to day activities of the intelligence service at home and abroad are convincing. Unlike many writers Le Carr\u00e9 is at his best showing men hard at work; he is fascinated by the office politics of the agency since the war. He even has a go at such \"novelistic\" effects as interlocking themes of sexual and political betrayal. Yet the plot is as tangled and suspenseful as any action fan could require, and the inductive skill of the diffident, intellectual hero should bring joy to the hearts of the purists. The scale and complexity of this novel are much greater than in any of Le Carr\u00e9's previous books. It marks a happy return to the spy genre for Le Carr\u00e9 ; his last book, \"The Na\u00d4ve and Sentimental Lover\" (1971), was a pretentious romantic story about a businessman, a writer and the woman they share -- an inept psychosexual portrait of the bourgeois and the bohemian soul.\nLe Carr\u00e9's career has been erratic from the start. Unlike most genre writers, he has never simply cranked out books according to a formula. His first two novels -- a modest spy story, \"Call for the Dead,\" in 1961 and a rather poor detective story, \"A Murder of Quality,\" in 1962 -- gave little sense that Le Carr\u00e9 would ever amount to very much. But his third book -- \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" in 1963 -- was manifestly the work of a strong and original popular novelist and was greeted with enthusiasm by such British worthies as C. P. Snow, J. B. Priestley and Graham Greene (who called it \"the best spy story I have ever read\"). The book became one of the great international best sellers of the 1960's and was the first thriller to dominate the American best seller lists for an entire year. Le Carr\u00e9 was established as an accomplished, intelligent genre writer as far from Ian Fleming as Ross Macdonald is from Mickey Spillane. His next book, \"The Looking Glass War\" in 1965, also sold well but it was distinctly less exciting, more of an atmospheric short story than a novel, for all its length. \"A Small Town in Germany\" in 1968 sold less well but is a most impressive popular novel; yet after it Le Carr\u00e9 abandoned the genre to write \"The Na\u00d4ve and Sentimental Lover,\" a book that failed with both critics and public.\n\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" is a full recovery, which in many ways consolidates Le Carr\u00e9's career. Its hero is a character whom Le Carr\u00e9 has used in almost every book, sometimes as the hero, sometimes in a minor role. Now he is more carefully developed than ever before.\nGeorge Smiley is a pudgy, middle-aged secret agent who seems \"breathtakingly ordinary.\" He's a quiet, bespectacled Oxford man with an interest in 17th-century German literature, an embarrassed or abstracted air, considerable physical awkwardness, and ill-fitting though expensive clothes. He is married to a glamorous, intelligent, aristocratic wife who (as at the start of every novel) has run off with one of her many lovers.\nSmiley is thus an anti-James Bond, an unheroic, frequently cuckolded secret agent who looks like a shy and miserable clerk in an old London bank. In fact, of course, Smiley is the finest secret agent in the world; his pathetic demeanor conceals a brilliant mind and stout heart. Smiley is one of the last English gentlemen -- not a strutting parody of the clubman, like Bond, or a foppish and conniving political type, but an honorable, decent fellow who hasn't much hope or comfort in the postwar world. He is the sorry witness of national decline, epitomized by the service: \"The inspired amateurism of a handful of highly qualified, underpaid men had given way to the efficiency, bureaucracy and intrigue of a large Government department.\"\nThe dramatic and sociological possibilities of such a hero are considerable, and in his new novel Le Carr\u00e9 certainly makes the most of them; but in his first two books he could barely see them: the novels stumble along quite artlessly, the prose is undistinguished. Instead of using Smiley as a means of criticizing the Establishment in its conduct of the secret service -- as he does in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" -- he first made Smiley a docile employe, then took him entirely out of the service and, somewhat hesitantly, put him up against the snobbery of an English public school.\nIn \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" Le Carr\u00e9 created a new hero, Alec Leamas, as a means of expressing an angry revaluation of the profession of espionage and the conventions of its fiction. Smiley appears only once, as a prissy little man, a part of the Establishment, fixing things up after Leamas has gone to jail. Leamas, by contrast, is an aggressive field agent, not a desk man; he is very strong, \"built like a swimmer,\" quick to anger, cynical, \"not quite a gentleman\" -- a virile, middle-aged angry young man who suggests more of James Bond's cold physical competence than Smiley's bumbling intellection.\nIn the end, after multiple twists and turns of the plot have revealed that Leamas's boss is as filthy as his East German enemies, Leamas declaims the ostensibly anti-romantic message of the book: \"What do you think spies are: priests, saints, martyrs? They're a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives.\" The British use spies \"so that the great moronic mass you admire can sleep soundly in their beds at night. They need [them] for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me.\"\nThere's clearly more than a little adolescent corn in this -- an easy romanticism of the sordid, a self-serving protestation that really honest people (like Leamas) who truly care about individual lives and the harmony of ends and means are simply not fit for this filthy world. There's a strong dose of moral snobbery and self-pity in Leamas's final self-sacrifice for love. But it is of just such vigorous clich\u00c8s that strong popular fiction is made. Leamas's aggression and physical activity seem to have brought Le Carr\u00e9 to life: the prose is quick, the dialogue right on pitch, the plot complex but highly charged, the background on life in England and Germany and on the methods and routines of the intelligence service is detailed and convincing. When le Carr\u00e9 had used Smiley as his hero, he had not been able to release the operatic energy of this book at its best (and worst).\n\"The Looking Glass War\" continued and deepened the critique of the intelligence service Establishment, but Le Carr\u00e9 was trapped within the point of view of a young, weak and na\u00d4ve hero quite unlike Leamas; the only active character in the book is a doomed, outmoded field agent -- a Danzig Pole desperate to be accepted as a real English gentleman. Le Carr\u00e9 goes into impressive and loving detail about the deluded old men of an inefficient sub-department of intelligence. Smiley appears in this book as an ominous representative of a rival agency, a member of the evil but realistic modern espionage Establishment, effective but devoid of honor and idealism.\n\"A Small Town in Germany\" was much more successful because it set a brutal, lower-class interrogator (who does resemble Leamas in many ways) against a cross-section of the Establishment (the British Embassy in Bonn) and had him chasing a seemingly insignificant fellow who has a touch of Smiley's pathos and turns out to have more brains, morals and political ideals than the bosses. The portrait of the city and of the Embassy and its employes is the best sustained description Le Carr\u00e9 achieved before his new book. The use of historical details and the sense of the German political climate during Britain's bid for entry to the Common Market are ambitions and well done. The plot is strong but relatively simple, a straight line: find the defector, expose hypocrisy, all in a few days.\nIn \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" Smiley comes to stand for moral and intellectual authority. He is the best man, responding to the call of duty: to spy against his former colleagues. Le Carr\u00e9 has learned a lot since he first created Smiley; he now can handle complementary heroes and intertwining plots. The story of Jim Prideaux, a strong field agent like Leamas who was shot in the back in suspicious circumstances abroad, counterpoints Smiley's research activities with melodramatic foreign adventures. In yet a further reclamation of old territory, Le Carr\u00e9 also sets the subplot at a public school, which is much more vividly portrayed than that in his second novel. His characterization too has become much richer: we meet Cabinet ministers, Whitehall officials, aides, journalists, old office hands; and there is an extremely dextrous off-stage portrait of Smiley's faithless wife. Le Carr\u00e9 has never presented so much detail about the intelligence Establishment, and he moves easily from past to present, from adventure to research and induction, and keeps one guessing right to the end which of the five top men is the double agent. Smiley has become humanity at its decent English best; the glamour of the Empire has faded, but he quietly carries on.\nLe Carr\u00e9's originality and distinction as a popular novelist lie in his use of the conventions of the spy novel for purposes of social criticism. In his introduction to The London Sunday Times Insight Team's study of \"The Philby Conspiracy\" (1968), Le Carr\u00e9 remarked that the career of the double agent Kim Philby -- who is a protype of the double agent in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" -- illustrates the \"capacity of the British ruling class for reluctant betrayal and polite self-preservation.\" The British secret services are \"microcosms of the British condition, of our social attitudes and vanities.\"\nIt is the late Victorian fantasy of \"the inarticulate supremacy of the English gentleman\" that is expressed in the traditional British spy novel. The genre grew with the British Empire; Stevensonian boy's novels of adventure in exotic places came to express a grandiose political and racial delusion from Kipling's \"Kim\" (1901) and John Buchan's \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" (1915), through W. Somerset Maugham's ostensibly cool and antiheroic \"Ashenden: or, The British Agent\" (1928) and Eric Ambler's \"A Coffin for Dimitrios\" (1939), right down to the camp, compensatory fantasies of dying Empire in Ian Fleming's James Bond series (1953-1965) and the hardboiled killers of Len Deighton's \"The Ipcress File\" (1962) or Frederick Forsyth's \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1971).\nIn none of these books do the authors worry about ends and means and class inequities. Since \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" Le Carr\u00e9 always does. He employs the techniques and conventions of these spy novels and is obviously concerned with the management of suspenseful effects -- there are plenty of pursuits and disguises and escapes in his books -- but he also draws upon the great tradition of English social realism, especially that part which in many ways begins with Dickens's \"Bleak House\" in 1853. In that novel Dickens uses a detective to help resolve the action: Inspector Bucket of the London Police brings the questing heroine to the symbolic center of England -- a dark graveyard in a London slum from which a smallpox epidemic and a network of deadlocked legal and sexual claims have spread out like ripples in a filthy well until they touch all of British society.\nThis symbolic and melodramatic kind of social criticism was continued in Henry James's \"The Princess Casamassima\" (1886) and Joseph Conrad's \"The Secret Agent\" (1907), in both of which the political spectre of anarchism was introduced. By the 1930's and 1940's Graham Greene could draw on this tradition to write chiaroscuro thrillers in which sordid crimes and rotten ideologies are portrayed as emblems of man's fallen condition; \"The Confidential Agent\" (1939) and \"The Ministry of Fear\" (1943) employed both the conventions of the spy novel and the critical possibilities of the Dickensian mode in order to express Roman Catholic theology. In much the same way, Norman Mailer in \"Barbary Shore\" (1951) mixed these traditions to present an ideological debate about socialism.\nSince 1960 the newspapers have been full of major spy stories: the U-2 overflights, the Philby conspiracy, the dangers of the Profumo affair, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy assassination, the C.I.A.'s activities in Indochina and Latin America, the rise of domestic surveillance and agents provocateurs, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, the resignation of Willy Brandt. Le Carr\u00e9's novels perfectly express the moral and political disillusion such revelations evoke in citizens of democratic countries who have long prided themselves on their \"open societies.\"\nAt one point in \"A Small Town in Germany\" a character repeats the old saw that a diplomat is a gentleman who lies for his country. Le Carr\u00e9's novels show us that such gentlemen are actually unprincipled fools and knaves quite given over to lying to their countrymen, their professional colleagues, their wives and themselves. The professions of diplomacy and espionage have very nearly become the same; the distinctions between the creation and execution of foreign policy are quite dangerously blurred. The \"great game,\" as Kipling called the maintenance of the British Empire by espionage in \"Kim,\" is no longer the sport of \"inspired amateurs\" or a \"secret elite\" who insure the beneficent rule of the all-wise British Lion. The lion is mangy, the Empire has crumbled, the agents have all gone to seed or become brutes and traitors available to the highest bidder or dangerously prone to political and ideological delusions.\nHowever, are not Le Carr\u00e9's novels, even at their best, falsely comforting? For all their angry social criticism, they always offer us the pleasures of imagining the world as it was portrayed in the good old-fashioned English novel of class and character, manners and morals: the surface details of the physical and social world are clearly seen; people's looks and voices are immediately categorized and brightly reproduced; the plots are complex, suspenseful, full of historical details, but they are always triumphantly concluded, all mysteries and ambiguities neatly resolved. The psychology is straightforward; motives tend to be unmixed; the tangles of sex and family life are simplified.\nLe Carr\u00e9's novels appear to dispel the romantic illusion of a strong, noble British Daddy who knows best: but is not George Smiley essentially a somewhat reduced and saddened but good old British Daddy all the same? Leamas dies a violent death, Smiley lives to rejoin his wife and spy another day; but in both cases they perpetuate national stereotypes. Quite inadvertently Le Carr\u00e9's novels reinforce the sodden liberalism they claim to condemn. They are nostalgic and given to self-pity; they offer two-dimensional models of human experience, melodramatic or sentimental answers to political dilemmas, and the simplistic and self-comforting suggestion that good men (and readers) should give up politics for lost and--like the victimized boy Candide -- go and cultivate their gardens. Le Carr\u00e9's books repeatedly express a horrified, morally outraged but essentially naive retreat from the full imagination of politics and society. His novels thus bear only superficial resemblance to such complex and ironic spy novels as Kurt Vonnegut's \"Mother Night\" (1961), Anthony Burgess's \"A Tremor of Intent\" (1967) and -- on the grand scale -- Thomas Pynchon's \"V.\" (1963) and \"Gravity's Rainbow\" (1973). In those books human experience is intrinsically problematical, often absurd; in Le Carr\u00e9's books everything works out. When Le Carr\u00e9 tried for depth in his last novel, he failed; modernism and the ironies of the literary novels of the 1960's are beyond him; but when, as in this new book, he shows the surface of experience in that good old-fashioned way, he is thoroughly entertaining.\nRichard Locke is an editor of The New York Times Book Review.\nReturn to the Books Home Page\n|\n|\nHome | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace\nQuick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel\nHelp/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/03/21/specials/lecarre-tinker.html", "tags": [{"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.94484"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.49440"}, {"label": "espionage", "score": "0.14228"}, {"label": "book reviews", "score": "0.04269"}, {"label": "writing and writers", "score": "0.03624"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02499"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.02273"}, {"label": "book trade", "score": "0.01687"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01193"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01159"}, {"label": "intelligence", "score": "0.01107"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.01060"}, {"label": "theater", "score": "0.00850"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.00653"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.00605"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.00513"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.00391"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00390"}, {"label": "terms not available", "score": "0.00385"}, {"label": "design", "score": "0.00359"}, {"label": "intelligence services", "score": "0.00353"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.00331"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.00330"}, {"label": "hoaxes", "score": "0.00296"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00296"}, {"label": "new models, design and products", "score": "0.00282"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.00263"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.00255"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.00253"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.00249"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["England", "America", "Germany", "London", "England", "Germany", "Germany", "Bonn", "Britain", "Empire", "the British Empire", "Empire", "England", "London", "Indochina", "Germany", "the British Empire", "Empire"], "ORG": ["Spies", "TINKER", "TAILOR", "the British Intelligence", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Oxford", "Smiley", "Bond", "Smiley", "Smiley", "Leamas", "Leamas", "Smiley", "Leamas", "Leamas", "Leamas", "Leamas", "Leamas", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Leamas", "Leamas", "the British Embassy", "Smiley", "Embassy", "Smiley", "Leamas", "Smiley", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Cabinet", "Whitehall", "Smiley", "Smiley", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "The London Sunday Times", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Stevensonian", "Kipling", "the London Police", "the Bay of Pigs", "C.I.A.", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "British Lion", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Leamas", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "Le Carr\u00e9's", "The New York Times Book Review"], "PERSON": ["RICHARD", "John Le Carr\u00e9", "Le Carr\u00e9", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "Graham Greene", "Dashiell Hammett", "James M.

There was baked ham, green beans and cherry pie for lunch. There was music \u2014 oldies and Christmas carols mostly. One club member, 84-year-old Herman Atwood, danced to \u201cMy Girl,\u201d twisting and twirling in his Sears Roebuck sweater vest as if he was at a wedding.\nSears may be struggling to survive after filing for bankruptcy in October, its rundown and empty stores symbolizing a has-been company that failed to adapt. But across the country, legions of former Sears workers like Mr. Atwood, a retired truck driver, gather regularly to reminisce about their long careers in retailing. The brands like Kenmore and DieHard that lasted for decades. The limitless creativity of shoplifters. The impossible task of selecting the women\u2019s shoe inventory.\nFor an older generation of Sears retirees, their former employer remains a central part of their lives, a throwback in an industry now known for high turnover, low wages and costly health care. Today, there are dozens of Sears alumni groups, from Bangor, Me., to Sioux Falls, S.D., forming one of the largest and most active retiree networks in the nation.\n\u201cIt feels like family,\u201d Mattie Hughey said as she sat with three friends she met packing catalog orders in the Sears warehouse in Atlanta 30 years ago.\nLong before it went bankrupt, before it was taken over by the hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert, and before Amazon pioneered internet shopping, Sears was the nation\u2019s largest retailer, with about 350,000 employees near its peak.\nIn its heyday, a period stretching from the end of World War II to the 1970s, Sears offered many of its workers a clear path to the middle class. The company paid well, shared profits and provided retirement benefits that have helped many former employees live in relative comfort.\nMadison Price, 87, comes every year to the holiday luncheon to see old friends and soak in the music. He grew up working on a farm in Georgia, helping grow cotton and corn. His father split the proceeds from their crops with the man who owned the farm. Mr. Price didn\u2019t finish high school and often missed school because he was needed on the farm.\nAfter returning from the Korean War, Mr. Price got a job as a janitor in a store in Atlanta in 1958. When he retired after 34 years, Mr. Price sold the Sears stock the company had granted him over the years and took his pension in a lump sum.\nHe reinvested the money only in things that he uses: shares in Georgia\u2019s power utilities and municipal bonds of DeKalb County and the Atlanta airport. Today, Mr. Price said he drew enough in dividends and interest from his investment portfolio, along with Social Security, to live comfortably. He paid for his son\u2019s college tuition, and his wife, Earnestine, has been able to take trips with her friends.\n\u201cI am blessed,\u201d Mr. Price said.\nMany of the retirees at the luncheon said they viewed their time at Sears as being part of something bigger than just working at a successful retailer. They worked for a force in American culture and business. Sears sold everything: feed for chickens, Whirlpool washing machines, as well as the nightgowns, watches and erector sets in the Christmas \u201cwish book.\u201d\n\u201cOne man came by looking for a wagon for his horse,\u201d said Jerril Parker, who worked in security at Sears in the Atlanta area for 45 years.\nSears also had an outsize physical presence. In Atlanta, the company occupied one of the largest buildings in the region \u2014 a store, warehouse and regional office covering over two million square feet. The red brick warehouse on Ponce De Leon Avenue was a precursor to the e-commerce fulfillment centers that shipped thousands of items ordered through the catalog.\nMr. Parker recalled hiding in a refrigerator box with small holes cut into the side so he could conduct surveillance on employees unloading merchandise.\nOne day, Mr. Parker said, his security staff caught a young seasonal worker trying to steal seven plaid skirts for his sister and her cheerleading squad by wearing them under his pants. \u201cHe just kept getting bigger and bigger through the day,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\nSears workers became experts in their fields \u2014 heating systems, kitchen appliances, cosmetics. And they were proud of what they sold. Elder Penny, who started at Sears after serving as a Navy supply officer in World War II, was a regional buyer of women\u2019s shoes. Mr. Penny, 94, still has the same Kenmore refrigerator he bought at Sears in 1974.\n\u201cI think I will wear out before it does,\u201d he said.\nThere was also a feeling of camaraderie and support. Decades ago, the Sears headquarters in Illinois were referred to as \u201cparent\u201d \u2014 a telling symbol of the way employees viewed their employer.\nExperienced workers took new recruits under their wing. When a manager relocated to a new store, other employees there helped him look for a new home.\nBill Rudolph, 66, came to the lunch with his friend Dorothy Davis, who he met when he was a manager in a Sears in the Atlanta area. He picked up Ms. Davis, 89, at her home and gave her a ride because she has stopped driving.\nMr. Rudolph, who started at Sears when he was 18, said Ms. Davis and other women looked out for him during his early years at the company. Mr. Rudolph went on to become a director of operations nationally before retiring in March after 47 years.\n\u201cIt was a place where people cared for each other,\u201d said Mr. Rudolph, who was overcome with emotion recalling the help he received from the older women.\nSears today is nothing like the company many retirees remember. The retailer stopped profit-sharing in the 1970s and more recently hired employees no longer receive pensions. Under its chairman, Mr. Lampert, the company has been selling off many of its most valuable stores and laying off thousands of workers.\nOn Friday, Mr. Lampert, through his hedge fund, ESL Investments, made a $4.4 billion bid to acquire many of the company\u2019s remaining assets, including its retail stores. Mr. Lampert said the proposal would keep 50,000 workers employed.\nRetirees warned long ago that Mr. Lampert\u2019s involvement with Sears would end badly. When his hedge fund acquired the company in 2005 by merging it with Kmart, a group of former workers hired a plane to fly over the headquarters in Illinois pulling a banner that read, \u201cSears Unfair to Retirees.\u201d\nThe group, National Association of Retired Sears Employees, has been keeping a close eye on their former employer under Mr. Lampert. They hold regular conference calls, where members detail the conditions of local Sears stores.\n\u201cI was in an auto center having four tires put on the other day,\u201d reported Jim McCurtain, a retiree from Tampa, on last month\u2019s conference call. \u201cThey did a great job.\u201d\nAnother retiree on the call reported that her friend successfully had the ice maker in her refrigerator cleaned out by a Sears repairman, whom she noted was \u201cvery precise, very courteous.\u201d\nThe retirees\u2019 pensions are expected to survive the bankruptcy largely intact thanks to a backstop from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But if Sears goes into a liquidation, which many analysts and investors say is likely, then the retirees would lose most of their life insurance benefits.\nIn the current incarnation of Sears, recruiting new members to the alumni groups has been difficult. Two decades ago, there were 250 clubs, now there are only about 45. More recent retirees, who did not receive pensions or profit-sharing, do not share the same allegiance as older generations.\n\u201cSears was a great company,\u201d said Ron Olbrysh, who retired from the Sears legal department in the 1990s and is now chairman of the national retiree association \u201cBut I am glad we got out when we did.\u201d\nAge is another challenge. The Atlanta club regularly updates its 160 members with a \u201cbereavement report\u201d listing local retirees who have died.\nAs the luncheon in Decatur finished, Lynn Walker Capland lingered in the church hall, helping clean off the tables and talking with friends. Ms. Capland, 66, is not only a former employee, she is what she calls a \u201cbyproduct of Sears.\u201d Her mother and father met while working at the Christmas pickup window in the Atlanta store.\nMs. Walker left the company before reaching retirement age because she said she wasn\u2019t suited for her final job in the collections department. But she still takes a day off from current work at an accounting firm to attend the luncheon every year.\n\u201cNo one makes time for these types of things anymore. Everyone is so busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis way of life is almost gone.\u201d\nMichael Corkery is a business reporter who covers the retail industry and its impact on consumers, workers and the economy.

The police, following leads in their search for the gunman, had the home under surveillance for more than 24 hours after the shooting of the officer, Ronil Singh, 33, of the Newman Police Department.\nOfficer Singh was shot after stopping a driver, identified by officials as Mr. Perez Arriaga, on suspicion of drunken driving, in Newman, Calif., which is not far from Modesto. Officer Singh was then taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to a statement from the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\nMr. Perez Arriaga, who had two previous arrests for driving while under the influence, was brought in wearing Officer Singh\u2019s handcuffs to Stanislaus County where he was to be charged with murder, Sheriff Christianson said. He did not immediately know the dispositions of the drunken-driving charges.\nThe sheriff said Mr. Perez Arriaga had crossed the border from Mexico illegally into Arizona \u201csome time ago,\u201d worked as a farm laborer and bragged on social media about being active in a street gang.\nMr. Perez Arriaga\u2019s reported status as someone who was in the country illegally added to the charged debate over immigration. President Trump tweeted about it on Thursday and at the news conference Sheriff Christianson criticized California\u2019s so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between federal immigration authorities and state and local law enforcement.\n\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that the outcome could have been different if law enforcement wasn\u2019t restricted, prohibited or had their hands tied because of political interference,\u201d he said. \u201cMy point is: Why are we providing sanctuary for criminals? Gang members? It\u2019s a conversation we need to have.\u201d\nThe sheriff said that officials believed the suspect was making his way to Mexico when he was arrested at a home in Lamont, Calif., about 10 miles outside of Bakersfield.\nThe sheriff said two other men who were also in the country illegally, Adrian Virgen, 25, and Erik Razo Quiroz, 27, were charged with accessory after the fact to a felony for helping Mr. Perez Arriaga escape. Mr. Virgen, Mr. Perez Arriaga\u2019s brother, was arrested in Hanford, and Mr. Razo Quiroz, his co-worker, in Modesto. The sheriff said the two men deliberately provided investigators with misleading information about the suspect\u2019s whereabouts.\nThree other people \u2014 a 57-year-old woman and two men, one 59 and the other 36 \u2014 were arrested at the house in Lamont and charged with aiding and abetting Mr. Perez Arriaga, the Kern County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on Facebook. Officials did not immediately provide details about how those three helped Mr. Perez Arriaga.\nSheriff Christianson said it was believed that Mr. Perez Arriaga was alone in his vehicle at the time of the shooting. He was unarmed when he was arrested, Sheriff Christianson said.\nA motive for the shooting was unclear. The Kern County sheriff, Donny Youngblood, suggested at a separate news conference that it might have been related to being stopped for suspicion of drunken driving, adding, \u201cFor a suspect to take an officer\u2019s life over a driving under the influence doesn\u2019t make any logical sense to me nor anyone else.\u201d\nOfficer Singh was an immigrant from Fiji, and had worked for the Newman Police Department since July 2011, officials said. He was married and had a 5-month-old son. After spending Christmas morning with his family, he went on duty that night.\nThe officer\u2019s younger brother, Reggie Singh, was distraught as he spoke at the news conference led by Sheriff Christianson.\nThrough tears, he thanked the law enforcement agencies for their work in making the arrests.\nReferring to his brother, he said: \u201cYes, he\u2019s not coming back.

Alive\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In one of their final acts in the House majority, Republicans released a letter on Friday urging their Senate counterparts to pick up their politically charged inquiry into the handling of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigations of President Trump\u2019s campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and called again for the appointment of a special counsel to study the matter.\nDetailing some of their findings, the chairmen of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees said it appeared to them that the F.B.I. had treated the Trump and Clinton cases differently, cutting Mrs. Clinton and her associates crucial breaks while assigning agents who privately exchanged reams of messages bashing Mr. Trump to investigate his campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\n\u201cIt is not the discovery of bias that is so destructive to fairness, it is the existence of it,\u201d the chairmen, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, wrote of the officials.\nThey also used the letter to resurface Republicans\u2019 contested charge that the F.B.I. abused sensitive surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign associate believed to be compromised by Russia.\nComing on a Friday evening before the New Year\u2019s holiday, the letter was an anemic end to a high-profile congressional investigation that has deeply divided Capitol Hill and delivered Mr. Trump a steady stream of talking points to attack the special counsel who inherited the Russia inquiry and others investigating him.\nIt amounted to an admission that Republican investigators from the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees had not completed the work they began in October 2017, and the letter did not appear to disclose any major previously unknown facts.\nHouse Democrats insisted throughout the investigation that Republicans\u2019 efforts were not carried out in good faith, accusing them of using Congress\u2019s oversight powers to relitigate the Clinton case and target those investigating Mr. Trump. When they take control of the committees next week, Democrats plan to reorient their investigative focus toward the president himself and his policies.\nIn a sign of how central investigations will be to the Democratic House, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the presumptive speaker, said on Friday that she had hired Douglas N. Letter, a former high-level Justice Department official with decades of experience, to serve as the House\u2019s top lawyer.\nMr. Goodlatte and Mr. Gowdy rejected assertions that their investigation had intentionally targeted the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. They said their goal was to restore confidence in institutions damaged in 2016.\n\u201cQuite the opposite, whatever product is produced by the special counsel must be trusted by Americans, and that requires asking tough but fair questions about investigative techniques both employed and not employed,\u201d they wrote. Both men are retiring in the coming days.\nBut after a slow start, the investigation came to encompass a bevy of politically charged topics and allowed Republicans to parade through Capitol Hill top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials involved in investigations.\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders in the House sit on the committees and used the investigation as a bludgeon on behalf of the president and to declare the Mueller investigation woefully biased against him. When the Justice Department balked at producing sensitive documents about the Trump inquiry, several Republicans threatened to impeach Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general then overseeing the investigation.\nThe letter from Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Gowdy was addressed to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general; and Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.\nMr. Horowitz is looking at many of the same issues the committee did and already released a 500-page report on the F.B.I.\u2019s conduct this year focused on the Clinton email case. It painted an unflattering picture of top bureau officials \u2014 including describing James B. Comey, the former director, as insubordinate and detailing texts by two senior officials bashing Mr. Trump \u2014 but did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted.\nMr. Horowitz is expected to release a second report sometime next year on the period focused on the opening of the investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia and the bureau\u2019s surveillance of the former Trump adviser, Carter Page.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who will take over next week as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said he plans to continue some of the investigative work done by House Republicans.\nRepublicans on the committees plan to release transcripts of each witness interview they conducted, including sessions with Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director; Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official targeted by Mr. Trump over his contacts with the author of a salacious dossier alleging coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia; and other top F.B.I. officials.

Silicon Valley Fears Losing Its Edge", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/technology/artificial-intelligence-export-restrictions.html", "text_content": "Curbs on A.I. Exports? Silicon Valley Fears Losing Its Edge\nThe Commerce Department is considering national security restrictions on artificial intelligence. Some worry they could stunt the industry in the U.S.\nSupported by\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A common belief among tech industry insiders is that Silicon Valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by Americans.\nNow a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of American companies in the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.\nIn November, the Commerce Department released a list of technologies, including artificial intelligence, that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security.\nTechnology experts worry that blocking the export of A.I. to other countries, or tying it up in red tape, will help A.I. industries flourish in those nations \u2014 China, in particular \u2014 and compete with American companies.\n\u201cThe number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very, very, very small, and the chance of making an error is quite large,\u201d said Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco. \u201cIf this goes wrong, it could do real damage to the A.I. community.\u201d\nThe export controls are being considered as the United States and China engage in a trade war. The Trump administration has been critical of the way China negotiates deals with American companies, often requiring the transfer of technology to Chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country. And federal officials are making an aggressive argument that China has stolen American technology through hacking and industrial espionage.\nTech companies, academics and policymakers are calling on the Commerce Department to take a light hand with A.I. export rules ahead of a Jan. 10 deadline for public comment. Their argument has three main points: Restrictions could harm companies in the United States and help international competitors. They could stifle technology improvements. And they may not make much of a difference.\nIn August, Congress passed the Export Controls Act of 2018, which added export restrictions to \u201cemerging and foundational technologies.\u201d In mid-November, the Commerce Department, tasked with overseeing the restrictions, published a list of technologies for consideration, including several categories of A.I. like computer vision, speech recognition and natural language understanding.\nThe restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries. Though it does not specify which ones, the Commerce Department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past. Those include China, Russia and Iran.\nThe Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions. After taking public comments, the department will draft a formal plan. It could result in anything from new licensing rules for A.I. exports to outright bans.\nArtificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the World Wide Web was 25 years ago.\nIt is easy to forget that before the mid-1990s, the tech industry in the United States was in a slump and the consumer electronics giants of Japan looked unbeatable. That changed as Silicon Valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and e-commerce. Today, the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook dominate tech all over the world.\nBut American dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed. China is investing billions in A.I. for both commercial and military use. And the expertise that has flooded to Silicon Valley over the years is starting to stay home, partly because of immigration restrictions. Centers for A.I. research are popping up all over the world, from Toronto to Cambridge, England, and Beijing.\nEnforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulators.\nA.I. is something policymakers call a dual-use technology. It has innocuous commercial applications, like helping to steer your car or ask your phone a question. It also has important military uses, like helping a weaponized drone find its targets.\nDefense planners believe A.I. represents the next notable change in military weapons, akin to the tactical targeting of so-called smart bombs a generation ago or nuclear weapons before that. A.I. can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videos.\nBut \u201ctrying to draw a line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult,\u201d said R. David Edelman, a technology policy researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt may be impossible.\u201d\nIt is difficult to put a \u201cmade in America\u201d label on artificial intelligence. Research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the world.\nCompanies rarely hold on to the details of their A.I. work, as if it were a secret recipe. Instead, they share what they learn, in hopes that other researchers can build on it. One company\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working on.\nA lot of the computer code for A.I. is published on sites like Arxiv.org, a repository of academic and corporate research. So, many policy experts believe that if the United States restricts the export of A.I. products and services, it will have little effect on the progress of A.I. in China and other countries.\n\u201cThe core of these technologies is international and freely available,\u201d said Mr. Edelman, who was a special assistant for economic and technology policy under President Barack Obama. \u201cNo country \u2014 the U.S. or China \u2014 has a monopoly on that.\u201d\nFederal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control. That means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental A.I. research. But it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information, said Greg Jaeger, a lawyer at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who deals with export controls.\nThe Commerce Department could also restrict the export of cloud-computing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence. The export restrictions memo mentions both.\nAmazon and Microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in China through local partners, and Google has long hoped to do the same thing. Amazon, Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\nOverly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the United States could also push researchers and companies into other countries.\n\u201cIt might be easier for people to just do this stuff in Europe,\u201d said Jason Waite, a lawyer with the firm Alston & Bird who specializes in international trade.\nFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz\nAdvertisement", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/technology/artificial-intelligence-export-restrictions.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.95167"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.84582"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.24592"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.15873"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.11751"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.09120"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.08527"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.07719"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.06274"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.06134"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.05270"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.05124"}, {"label": "codes (ciphers)", "score": "0.04968"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.04259"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.03241"}, {"label": "arms sales abroad", "score": "0.03054"}, {"label": "science and technology", "score": "0.02979"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02790"}, {"label": "intelligence", "score": "0.02715"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.02561"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.02403"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.02336"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.02087"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01883"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.01827"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.01761"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.01684"}, {"label": "internet and world wide web", "score": "0.01683"}, {"label": "data processing (computers)", "score": "0.01594"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.01583"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["U.S.", "SAN FRANCISCO", "China", "San Francisco", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "the United States", "China", "Russia", "Iran", "the United States", "Japan", "China", "Toronto", "Cambridge", "England", "Beijing", "America", "the United States", "U.S.", "China", "China", "the United States"], "ORG": ["A.I.

He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\nDemocrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.\nThe events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u2014 poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u2014 who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nWith the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.\n\u201cCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a subject to walk away from.\u201d\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u201cWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u201d\n\u201cHe could not give a good answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\nMr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u201ca good Catholic\u201d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.\n[Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts. Read more fact checks from the president's cabinet meeting on Wednesday.]\nIn her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.\nMr. Trump\u2019s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.\nThe president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u2019s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.\nIn a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u201cI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u2019s get it done!\u201d\nBut the path to such a deal is murky at best.\nBefore he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.\n\u201cNo, not $2.5 billion, no \u2014 we\u2019re asking for $5.6\u201d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.\nHis rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.\nThe larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.\nBut inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.\nWednesday\u2019s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u2014 and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.\nBut it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.\nMr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u2019s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cDemocrats in the room either don\u2019t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u201d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was incredibly disheartening that they don\u2019t want to know the facts when making policy.\u201d\nYet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.\n\u201cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\u201d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u201ca sieve\u201d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.\n\u201cWalls work,\u201d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u201caround his compound\u201d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)\nMr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.\nOutside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u2019s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nIncoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u2019s effect. \u201cThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u201d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.\nShe noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u201cI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u201d she said.\nPeter Baker and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-congress-shutdown.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.75289"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.34234"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.31831"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.30604"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.10688"}, {"label": "minorities (us)", "score": "0.10175"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.06297"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.06262"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.05426"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.04752"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.04441"}, {"label": "minorities (ethnic, racial, religious)", "score": "0.04391"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.02940"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.02287"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02263"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.02185"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.02112"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02033"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01820"}, {"label": "legislatures and parliaments", "score": "0.01633"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01335"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.01178"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.01118"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01116"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.00885"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.00815"}, {"label": "suspensions, dismissals and resignations", "score": "0.00801"}, {"label": "historic buildings and sites", "score": "0.00739"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00633"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00591"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Trump", "WASHINGTON", "New York", "California", "Kentucky", "California", "Vatican City", "Vatican City", "San Diego", "The United States", "Washington", "Mexico", "Tennessee", "New Jersey"], "ORG": ["White House", "House", "the Department of Homeland Security", "White House", "the White House", "America Safe", "White House", "House", "Senate", "the White House", "Congress", "the Department of Homeland Security", "the White House", "The Washington Post", "Twitter", "House"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Chuck Schumer", "Mike Pence", "Kevin McCarthy", "Mitch McConnell", "Trump", "McConnell", "Trump", "Trump", "Nancy Pelosi", "Schumer", "Trump", "Pelosi", "Pelosi", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Pelosi", "Trump", "Trump", "Pence", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Pence", "McCarthy", "Pelosi", "Schumer", "Trump", "Trump", "Kirstjen Nielsen", "Schumer", "Pelosi", "Nielsen", "Pelosi", "Katie Waldman", "Trump", "Barack Obama", "Obama", "Trump", "Lamar Alexander", "Grant", "Mikie Sherrill", "Peter Baker", "Emily Cochrane"]}}, {"index": 49, "year": 2019, "title": "At Rally for Jazmine Barnes, an Outpouring of Grief and a Plea for Answers", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/us/jazmine-barnes-houston-rally.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nAt Rally for Jazmine Barnes, an Outpouring of Grief and a Plea for Answers\nDavid Montgomery and\nHOUSTON \u2014 Relatives of Jazmine Barnes, the 7-year-old Texas girl who was fatally shot inside a moving car, grieved on Saturday at an emotionally charged rally not far from where the gunman opened fire on a family that was out on a morning coffee run.\nNearly 1,000 people gathered to honor Jazmine and to urge law enforcement to find the man who the police said attacked on Dec. 30 without provocation.\nJazmine, who was black, was in the car with her mother and three sisters when a white man pulled his red pickup truck beside them and began shooting, the police said.

A pastor led them in prayer.\nMs. Washington told The Houston Chronicle that she believed the attack was racially motivated, and the case has drawn attention from civil rights activists across the country.\n\u201cI have no tint on my windows or anything so you can see there is a mother \u2014 a black mother \u2014 with daughters, beautiful children,\u201d Ms. Washington told CNN. \u201cYou took my baby from me and you have no care in the world.\u201d\nSheriff Ed Gonzalez of Harris County, Tex., said at a news conference this week that it was too early for investigators to speculate about the gunman\u2019s motive because he had not yet been identified.\nCommunity members drew a connection to a shooting in August 2017, which remains unsolved.\nIn that episode, a white man in a pickup opened fire with an AR-15-style rifle at a car carrying A\u2019Vonta Williams, who is black, and his girlfriend\u2019s family, according to the sheriff\u2019s office and Mr. Williams\u2019s mother. No one was killed but both of Mr. Williams\u2019s legs were shattered by a bullet, said his mother, Kisshima Williams. The girlfriend\u2019s grandmother was also injured.\nSheriff Gonzalez said the police were taking a fresh look at that case for any possible links to the recent attack. The shootings occurred about six miles apart, he said.\nLee Merritt, a Philadelphia-based lawyer representing Jazmine\u2019s family, said on Saturday he believed the shooting had the markings of a hate crime, in part because of the \u201crandomness and unprovoked nature\u201d of the attack.\nUnited States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Houston, said the racial dynamics of the case were apparent. \u201cDo not be afraid to call this what it seems to be: a hate crime,\u201d she told the crowd, demanding an investigation by the Justice Department.\nAfter Jazmine\u2019s killing, the public mobilized to help the family. Mr. Merritt and Shaun King, a prominent racial justice activist and a columnist at The Intercept, have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the gunman\u2019s arrest. DeAndre Hopkins, a wide receiver for the Houston Texans, pledged to donate his paycheck from this weekend\u2019s playoff game, which amounts to $29,000, to help pay for Jazmine\u2019s funeral.\nAt the rally on Saturday, supporters clutched banners and artwork dedicated to Jazmine, who was in second grade at a Houston-area school.\n\u201cNo peace, no justice,\u201d the crowd chanted. Many parents said the shooting put them in fear of their own lives and those of their children.\nThe site of the rally, a Walmart parking lot, was about a half-mile from where the attack took place, said Lt. Eric Batton of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The store provided the police with the first clue about the gunman\u2019s identity: images of his pickup truck captured by video surveillance.\nBut aside from a sketch of the gunman, his identity remains unknown. At the rally, Sheriff Gonzalez urged the crowd to keep reporting possible leads to police. \u201cWe\u2019re always just one phone call away from being able to break this case,\u201d he said.\nKim Green, a 44-year-old mother of two boys, said she drove more than 50 miles with her 12-year-old son, Khayman Clarkson, to attend the rally.\nShe clutched a banner reading \u201cJustice\u201d and \u201cJazmine\u201d and a drawing of a princess she planned to give the family.\n\u201cI have two black boys living in the middle of all these senseless killings,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about my own children.

He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\nDemocrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.\nThe events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u2014 poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u2014 who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nWith the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.\n\u201cCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a subject to walk away from.\u201d\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u201cWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u201d\n\u201cHe could not give a good answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\nMr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u201ca good Catholic\u201d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.\n[Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts. Read more fact checks from the president's cabinet meeting on Wednesday.]\nIn her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.\nMr. Trump\u2019s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.\nThe president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u2019s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.\nIn a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u201cI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u2019s get it done!\u201d\nBut the path to such a deal is murky at best.\nBefore he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.\n\u201cNo, not $2.5 billion, no \u2014 we\u2019re asking for $5.6\u201d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.\nHis rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.\nThe larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.\nBut inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.\nWednesday\u2019s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u2014 and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.\nBut it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.\nMr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u2019s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cDemocrats in the room either don\u2019t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u201d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was incredibly disheartening that they don\u2019t want to know the facts when making policy.\u201d\nYet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.\n\u201cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\u201d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u201ca sieve\u201d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.\n\u201cWalls work,\u201d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u201caround his compound\u201d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)\nMr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.\nOutside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u2019s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nIncoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u2019s effect. \u201cThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u201d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.\nShe noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u201cI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u201d she said.\nPeter Baker and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-congress-shutdown.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.75289"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.34234"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.31831"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.30604"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.10688"}, {"label": "minorities (us)", "score": "0.10175"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.06297"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.06262"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.05426"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.04752"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.04441"}, {"label": "minorities (ethnic, racial, religious)", "score": "0.04391"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.02940"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.02287"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02263"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.02185"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.02112"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02033"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01820"}, {"label": "legislatures and parliaments", "score": "0.01633"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01335"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.01178"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.01118"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01116"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.00885"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.00815"}, {"label": "suspensions, dismissals and resignations", "score": "0.00801"}, {"label": "historic buildings and sites", "score": "0.00739"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00633"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00591"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Trump", "WASHINGTON", "New York", "California", "Kentucky", "California", "Vatican City", "Vatican City", "San Diego", "The United States", "Washington", "Mexico", "Tennessee", "New Jersey"], "ORG": ["White House", "House", "the Department of Homeland Security", "White House", "the White House", "America Safe", "White House", "House", "Senate", "the White House", "Congress", "the Department of Homeland Security", "the White House", "The Washington Post", "Twitter", "House"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Chuck Schumer", "Mike Pence", "Kevin McCarthy", "Mitch McConnell", "Trump", "McConnell", "Trump", "Trump", "Nancy Pelosi", "Schumer", "Trump", "Pelosi", "Pelosi", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Pelosi", "Trump", "Trump", "Pence", "Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Pence", "McCarthy", "Pelosi", "Schumer", "Trump", "Trump", "Kirstjen Nielsen", "Schumer", "Pelosi", "Nielsen", "Pelosi", "Katie Waldman", "Trump", "Barack Obama", "Obama", "Trump", "Lamar Alexander", "Grant", "Mikie Sherrill", "Peter Baker", "Emily Cochrane"]}}, {"index": 51, "year": 2019, "title": "How PG&E Lobbied for Wildfire Protection", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/california-today-pge-wildfire-protection.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nHow PG&E Lobbied for Wildfire Protection\nGood morning.\n(Here\u2019s the sign-up, if you don\u2019t already get California Today by email)\nAfter California\u2019s deadliest wildfire all but wiped out the town of Paradise and killed 86 people in November, calls have risen for Pacific Gas & Electric to be held financially accountable for any role the company may have played in sparking the blaze.\nMore fires have been traced to equipment owned by the utilities, but in 2017, legislators moved to protect the companies from bearing the cost, arguing that the companies otherwise risked bankruptcy.

Experts Say That Makes Little Sense\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico, in one of his central justifications for building a border wall.\nBut his own government\u2019s assessments conclude that Mr. Trump has seriously overstated the threat. And counterterrorism officials and experts said there had never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country through open areas of the southwest border.\nDespite the administration\u2019s focus on security threats at the border, a White House strategy document sent to Congress last month outlining steps needed to monitor and intercept terrorists included no reference to the need for construction of barriers, fences or walls. Separately, an intelligence analysis concluded that cyberattacks are the top threat to the United States \u2014 not terrorists at the border.\n\u201cThere is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States,\u201d Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d\nIn a rare prime-time address to the nation, broadcast at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was expected to describe a national security crisis brewing at the Mexican border. It was his opportunity to directly defend his demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall \u2014 funding that congressional Democrats have refused to provide, fueling the 18-day government shutdown.\nMany Latin American countries have border law enforcement gaps \u2014 limited law enforcement capabilities and established smuggling routes \u2014 that extremists could exploit to harm the United States, according to the State Department\u2019s latest Country Reports on Terrorism.\nBut, the report concluded, that has not happened.\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups, but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region,\u201d the report said.\nThe latest ranking of urgent national security vulnerabilities, compiled annually by American intelligence agencies, puts the terrorist threat from the southwest border low on the list and then mentions it in a discussion of how \u201cworldwide production of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is at record levels.\u201d\nOver the last several days, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials have relentlessly pushed the case that the situation at the border is both a national security crisis and a humanitarian one.\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday that \u201cnearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally,\u201d and added that the \u201cmost vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.\u201d\nA day later, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, called those comments \u201can unfortunate misstatement.\u201d\nAt the same time, in a memo sent to journalists late Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, cited \u201cmore than 3,000 \u2018special-interest aliens\u2019 \u2014 individuals with suspicious travel patterns\u201d who posed a potential national security risk.\n\u201cThe threat is real,\u201d she wrote in a series of tweets on Monday afternoon. \u201cThe number of terror-watchlisted encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive.\u201d\nFormer national security officials and analysts have pushed back \u2014 especially on the notion that terrorism suspects or their sympathizers use the southwest border as a door to the United States.\n\u201cThat 4,000 number was bull,\u201d said W. Ralph Basham, who served as commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009, during the Bush administration.\n\u201cThe idea that you have that many terrorists flooding across the border when you have all of these dedicated agents focused on stopping that kind of activity is ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Basham said.\nA senior American counterterrorism official said on Tuesday night that an annual average of three known or suspected terrorists \u2014 all of whom were on watch lists \u2014 had tried to enter the United States at a legal border crossing or entry point over the last several years, and had been denied.\nA 22-page National Strategy to Combat Terrorism Travel, overseen by the staff of the National Security Council and under Mr. Trump\u2019s signature, cited a broad commitment to making it \u201cmore difficult for terrorists to cross U.S. borders.\u201d\nSent to Congress on Dec. 21, the day before the government shutdown began, the document urged data sharing and improved coordination with foreign partners to identify terrorists before they travel. It did not urge the construction of a border wall.\nThe only explicit reference to \u201cborder security\u201d in the document, which was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times, is a listing of executive orders that Mr. Trump has already signed. It also included strategies to \u201cinterdict\u201d potential terrorists with plans to \u201cmaintain the equipment and technology\u201d necessary to stop bad actors and share real-time information between law enforcement agencies.\nThe 2018 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ranked cyberattacks against utilities, communications systems and markets as the top threat to the United States. Published annually by American intelligence agencies, the ranking has not changed much over the past five years.\nBut the government shutdown has furloughed nearly half of the work force of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is advertised as the first line of defense against network attacks. Mr. Trump has also dismantled the office of the White House cybersecurity coordinator, the job that was supposed to sew together offense and defense against the daily barrage of cyberattacks.\nAfter cyberattacks, the top threats to the United States include the rise of smaller, more deadly nuclear and biological weapons; terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda; and Russian-style influence campaigns and threats to the United States\u2019 space assets.\nCounterterrorism officials have long discounted the threat of Islamic State or Qaeda terrorists entering through the southwest border. In some cases, the opposite has happened, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University\u2019s program on extremism, citing homegrown American extremists who crossed into Mexico to avoid being detected on no-fly lists.\nOfficials included the case of Jason Ludke of Milwaukee, who pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. He and a co-conspirator were headed to the border in Texas, with plans to join the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq, when they were arrested.\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mr. Ludke had planned to work under the Islamic State\u2019s direction and control and recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the terrorist group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mr. Ludke told an undercover F.B.I. agent that he had training in jujitsu and computers, which he believed would benefit the Islamic State.\nEven as Mr. Trump has lobbied for the wall, he has also pressed the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately tighten security on the border.\nOn Dec. 27, homeland security officials asked for assistance that the Pentagon later estimated would require 3,000 additional military personnel to be sent to the border, according to memos exchanged by the two departments over the last two weeks. The force could include a combination of National Guard troops, active-duty military personnel and volunteers, but that was not made clear in the documents, officials said. It remains an issue of hot debate inside the Pentagon.\nThe Homeland Security Department also requested 146 mobile surveillance vehicles to be sent to four border states, along with enough personnel and material to install 150 additional miles of barbed concertina wire. The homeland security memo also again asked Defense Department officials to provide additional aviation support to monitor and control the flow of immigrants.\nThe Pentagon has not yet approved the request. It included guidelines for Ms. Nielsen and other homeland security officials to \u201ctake the lead\u201d on strategic communications intended to highlight the Pentagon\u2019s role. It also made clear the troops would carry no weapons.\nThomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/trump-border-wall-terrorists.html", "tags": [{"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.60990"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.40793"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.32049"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.27419"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.24966"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.21961"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.20209"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.15598"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.08761"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.07548"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.06509"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.04848"}, {"label": "pentagon building", "score": "0.04636"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.04221"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.03622"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.02526"}, {"label": "intelligence", "score": "0.02505"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02351"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.02096"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.01863"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.01744"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.01744"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01673"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01432"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.01431"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01318"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.01150"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00985"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.00973"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00963"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["WASHINGTON", "the United States", "Mexico", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "U.S.", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States\u2019", "Mexico", "Milwaukee", "Texas", "Syria", "Iraq"], "ORG": ["White House", "Congress", "the National Counterterrorism Center", "the State Department\u2019s", "White House", "Department of Homeland Security", "White House", "White House", "United States Customs and Border Protection", "National Strategy to Combat Terrorism Travel", "the National Security Council", "Congress", "The New York Times", "the Office of the Director of National Intelligence", "the Department of Homeland Security", "Cybersecurity", "White House", "the Islamic State", "Al Qaeda", "Counterterrorism", "Islamic State", "Qaeda", "George Washington University\u2019s", "the Islamic State", "the Islamic State", "the Islamic State\u2019s", "Pentagon", "the Department of Homeland Security", "Pentagon", "National Guard", "The Homeland Security Department", "Defense Department", "Pentagon", "Pentagon"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Trump", "Nicholas J.

Kruse and\nMr. Kruse and Mr. Zelizer are the authors of \u201cFault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.\u201d\nFor all his bluster, Donald Trump is generally seen by presidential observers as a shockingly weak president. Brought to office in an election in which he lost the popular vote, his approval ratings have remained consistently low. Even with his party in control of the White House and Congress for two years, beyond a typical Republican tax cut, Mr. Trump failed to secure a signature legislative accomplishment.\nThe president may seem weak, but the presidency remains strong. Mr. Trump has illustrated that even a feeble commander in chief can impose his will on the nation if he lacks any sense of restraint or respect for political norms and guardrails. True, Mr. Trump has not been able to run roughshod over Congress or ignore the constraints of the federal courts. But he has been able to inflict extensive damage on our political institutions and public culture. He has used his power to aggravate, rather than calm, the fault lines that have divided our country.\nHis \u201cwall\u201d government shutdown is the latest example of his misuse of executive power. To end this essentially pointless standoff of his own making, he is exploring the use of national emergency powers to build a wall Congress and a majority of the public don\u2019t want.\nThe Trump administration has provided a new example of an old concept: the \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d That term, famously used by the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1973 to describe the excesses and abuses of the Nixon White House, fell out of use almost as soon as President Richard Nixon fell from grace. The reckoning of Watergate and the first-ever resignation of a president seemed to show that the executive branch was not as uncontrollable as it had once seemed.\nCongress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president\u2019s power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.\nDespite these reforms, four decades later, the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?\nThe most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.\nSince the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one\u2019s own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.\nRepublicans have done much in the same vein, in moments of divided and united government alike. Republicans have also gone a step further to protect the party\u2019s electoral interests through the use of, for instance, strict voter-ID laws.\nAggressive presidents also depend on a partisan media to do their work without too much pushback. President Trump has demonstrated how this could be turned into a powerful tool for the White House. Mr. Trump has routinely repeated stories seen on the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning program and leaned on conservative cable hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs for advice as well. Indeed, the line between the Trump White House and conservative media outlets has become blurred beyond recognition. The former CNBC host Larry Kudlow now serves as head of the National Economic Council, while the former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Heather Nauert has been nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Bill Shine, a former executive at Fox News, now runs the White House Communications Office.\nThe imperial presidency is, in many ways, propped up by media partisans who insist that the naked emperor has glorious new clothes.\nMr. Trump has revealed that the president can act \u201cimperially\u201d because norms matter as much as rules and procedure. The reformers of the 1970s missed the ways in which reforms simply cannot restrain a president who doesn\u2019t care about institutions. The most important source of presidential restraint has been the character of the person in office.\nFor all his flaws, Mr. Nixon was unwilling to tear down the government to save himself. Mr. Trump has revealed that when a president is willing to cross what seemed to be clear lines, no one is there to hold him back.\nWith Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the Mueller investigation seemingly coming to a conclusion as well, Mr. Trump will likely be held to account, in one form or another. But it\u2019s important to remember that the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d will outlive any one president unless more is done to institute real checks and balances on the office itself.\nCongress has the most effective means of putting new limits on the White House through oversight. Many of the tools that Congress needs are right in front of it \u2014 holding serious hearings about the material in a Mueller report or making sure that legislation like the National Emergency Act is enforced \u2014 but it must use them.\nIf Mr. Trump invokes emergency power to build a wall, Congress needs to respond by passing legislation that will take back some of the power it granted in 1976.\nMost important, reforming presidential power will fall on the shoulders of voters. In the end, the most effective check on presidential power is to elect presidents who will exercise their authority with some restraint and respect our democratic institutions. That is the choice voters will have in 2020.\nKevin M. Kruse and Julian E.

Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\nYou write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that\u2019s the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn\u2019t include the two to three hours I use WeChat\u2019s web version.\nI\u2019m not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people\u2019s lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.\nSo as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I\u2019ll always be on top of what\u2019s going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren\u2019t so busy.\nBy now, some readers must be screaming, \u201cHow about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?\u201d Sadly, it\u2019s just the way of life in China. I\u2019m not trying to make light of the issue. I\u2019ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance.\nI\u2019ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven\u2019t had much success.\nI also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don\u2019t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs.\nBut Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That\u2019s where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.\nHow do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?\nThe first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.\nBecause of WeChat\u2019s prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there\u2019s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become \u201cfriends.\u201d I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it\u2019s a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.\nMany businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don\u2019t know how they manage so many contacts.\nGenerally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mantra. Many people in China\u2019s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.\nWhy are mobile wallets so popular in China?\nWhen I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn\u2019t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming.\nThen came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.\nMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I\u2019ve been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven\u2019t found an occasion to use it. Everybody \u2014 hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands \u2014 takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment.\nWhat are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?\nThe hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it\u2019s \u201ca quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u2018Carpool Karaoke.\u2019\u201d\nTo be honest, I\u2019m too old for the app \u2014 Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings \u2014 and have not spent much time on it. But I\u2019ve seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users\u2019 viewing history.\nThe short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin\u2019s rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d of China. It\u2019s where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.\nOutside of work, what tech product are you into right now?\nI\u2019m a very low-tech person!

Food Inspections", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/health/shutdown-fda-food-inspections.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nGovernment Shutdown Curtails F.D.A. Food Inspections\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration has stopped routine food safety inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and many other foods at high risk of contamination because of the federal government\u2019s shutdown, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency\u2019s commissioner, said on Wednesday.\nF.D.A. inspectors normally examine operations at about 160 domestic manufacturing and food processing plants each week. Nearly one-third of them are considered to be at high risk of causing food-borne illnesses. Food-borne diseases in the United States send about 128,000 people to the hospital each year, and kill 3,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDomestic meat and poultry are still being inspected by staff at the Agriculture Department, but they are going without pay. The F.D.A. oversees about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s food supply, as well as most overseas imports.\nIn a series of tweets, Dr. Gottlieb said he was taking steps to restore food safety surveillance inspections and to cover more of the high-risk sites as the shutdown continued. He said he hoped to bring back about 150 inspectors who had been furloughed during the shutdown, perhaps as early as next week.\nDr. Gottlieb said he was still trying to figure out how that could be achieved. \u201cThese are people who are now furloughed and can collect unemployment insurance or take a second job,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we pull them in and tell them they have to work, they can\u2019t collect. I have to make sure I\u2019m not imposing an undue hardship.\u201d\nFood safety advocates said they were worried that outbreaks would not be prevented without inspections, or would not be caught at the earliest warning signs.\n\u201cThese are inspections where they catch issues before people get sick,\u201d said Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. \u201cThe announcement that they are going to try to start up high-risk inspections is a positive step. But, we\u2019ve had outbreaks from foods that are not high risk \u2014 from flour, from packaged foods. So I think that the fact that two-thirds of establishments are not going to be inspected is still a problem.\u201d\nThe F.D.A. inspects food companies for bugs, rodents, mishandled food, improper preparation and other hazards.\nDr. Gottlieb said that inspections of overseas products have continued, despite the furloughs. He also said that the agency has maintained surveillance of some domestic producers who have had a history of problems or pose risks for other reasons.\nSoon after the shutdown began, the F.D.A. gave inspectors access to a central expense account so they could continue traveling while avoiding large personal credit card bills without knowing when the government would reimburse them.\nThe agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is not dependent on federal funding for all of its activities. It receives much of its support from user fees imposed on the pharmaceutical, medical device, generic drug and other industries it regulates.\nAlthough about 41 percent of the staff is now furloughed because the agency had not received its federal appropriations before the shutdown, those in jobs supported by user fees have remained at work. But even those departments have taken a hit, as the F.D.A. has had to shift priorities for some duties.\nIn the pharmaceutical section, for example, some officials who generally consider pending drug applications are now working on post-market surveillance, checking for adverse events, like unexpected side effects of drugs or other problems.\n\u201cWe have a deep concern about those employees who were furloughed, their inability to fulfill their public health functions, and the tremendous personal impact that it has on them,\u201d said Ladd Wiley, executive director of the Alliance for a Stronger F.D.A., a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cWe are also grateful to the roughly 10,000 employees who are retained and working.\u201d\nBut, Mr. Wiley added, his organization also was concerned about nonemergency functions that the F.D.A. has had to put aside. Among the important work being delayed right now, he noted, are manufacturing inspections, technical assistance and advice to the produce industry \u2014 especially guidance for preventing contamination \u2014 and activity related to food additives.\n\u201cThere is a whole list of things that are not getting done,\u201d he said.\nSome public health experts were worried about the impact of the shutdown on inspection of fish. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he was concerned about contaminated shellfish ending up on store shelves during the shutdown.\nIn particular, he said, consumers should watch out for clams, mussels, oysters and other bivalves that may come from contaminated water. \u201cIt can be very nasty stuff,\u201d said Dr. Rosenberg, a former official with the seafood inspection program run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cIt can be anything from E. coli to Vibrio. It is important for people to look for an inspection certificate.\u201d\nHe noted that the NOAA website says the inspectors are working without pay; so are meat and poultry inspectors, according to the Department of Agriculture. Michael Halpern, deputy director of the science and democracy center, thinks that\u2019s a problem not just for the workers but for consumers if the furloughed inspectors turn to temporary jobs to support themselves, creating a shortage.\n\u201cWe have food outbreaks even during normal times, and if the agency is stretched even thinner, it can\u2019t cover much ground,\u201d he said.\nOne of the most prominent food-borne illness outbreaks recently involved romaine lettuce. In an odd bit of timing, the C.D.C. issued a statement on Wednesday noting that the latest spate of problems from contaminated romaine began in October, sickening 62 people in 16 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe C.D.C. and the F.D.A. traced some of the contamination back to Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif., citing E. coli traced to an agricultural reservoir there. The F.D.A. issued a separate statement saying that it would continue to investigate the source, even though the C.D.C. has declared the outbreak to be over.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/health/shutdown-fda-food-inspections.html", "tags": [{"label": "food contamination and poisoning", "score": "0.93841"}, {"label": "food", "score": "0.80106"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.30057"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.15114"}, {"label": "meat", "score": "0.15092"}, {"label": "diet and nutrition", "score": "0.09438"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.08241"}, {"label": "consumer protection", "score": "0.05220"}, {"label": "poultry", "score": "0.05070"}, {"label": "animals", "score": "0.03709"}, {"label": "shutdowns (institutional)", "score": "0.03168"}, {"label": "pesticides and pests", "score": "0.02767"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02758"}, {"label": "diseases and conditions", "score": "0.02562"}, {"label": "chemicals", "score": "0.02557"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02526"}, {"label": "hazardous and toxic substances", "score": "0.02523"}, {"label": "regulation and deregulation of industry", "score": "0.02470"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.02325"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.02171"}, {"label": "sanitation", "score": "0.02119"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.02095"}, {"label": "factories and industrial plants", "score": "0.01972"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01924"}, {"label": "pesticides", "score": "0.01882"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01633"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01624"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01596"}, {"label": "industrial and occupational hazards", "score": "0.01575"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.01396"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["WASHINGTON", "the United States", "the District of Columbia", "Santa Barbara County", "Calif."], "ORG": ["The Food and Drug Administration", "F.D.A.", "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "the Agriculture Department", "F.D.A.", "the Center for Science in the Public Interest", "F.D.A.", "F.D.A.", "the Department of Health and Human Services", "F.D.A.", "Alliance", "F.D.A.", "the Center for Science and Democracy", "the Union of Concerned Scientists", "the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "NOAA", "the Department of Agriculture", "C.D.C.", "C.D.C.", "F.D.A.", "F.D.A.", "C.D.C."], "PERSON": ["Scott Gottlieb", "Gottlieb", "Gottlieb", "Sarah Sorscher", "Gottlieb", "Ladd Wiley", "Wiley", "Andrew Rosenberg", "Rosenberg", "Michael Halpern", "Adam Brothers Farming", "E. coli"]}}, {"index": 57, "year": 2019, "title": "What\u2019s on TV Thursday: \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019 and \u2018Lodge 49\u2019", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/television/whats-on-tv-thursday-brooklyn-nine-nine-and-lodge-49.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nWhat\u2019s on TV Thursday: \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019 and \u2018Lodge 49\u2019\nAndy Samberg\u2019s cop comedy \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d makes its sixth season premiere on NBC, and the first season of \u201cLodge 49\u201d is available to stream on Hulu.\nWhat\u2019s on TV\nBROOKLYN NINE-NINE 9 p.m. on NBC.

The special also features surveillance material and recordings gathered by the special counsel, and excerpts from Barbara Walters\u2019s 1999 interview with Lewinsky.

Huawei has denied that it spies for Beijing.\nBut American counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors have investigated the company on national security grounds for years. And in August, a judge in New York issued a warrant for Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest on charges of bank fraud. According to Canadian officials, the United States has accused Ms. Meng of tricking banks into carrying out transactions involving Huawei-controlled entities that violated American sanctions on Iran.\nCanada, where Ms. Meng was arrested on Dec. 1 while changing planes, has found itself caught in the middle of a clash between the countries with the world\u2019s biggest economies.\nLess than a week after the Canadian government announced Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, China detained two Canadian citizens, accusing them of undermining Chinese national security. The Chinese authorities have not elaborated on their reasons for holding the men: Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman. But the detentions were viewed by many as an effort to seek leverage in negotiations over Ms. Meng\u2019s fate.\nThe standoff escalated after a third Canadian was held in China, on accusations of working without a valid visa. In late December, a Chinese court also ordered the retrial of a Canadian man on a drug-smuggling charge. Prosecutors argued that his original 15-year prison sentence had been too light.\nMs. Meng has been released on bail by a Canadian court, and is living under surveillance in one of her homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canadian legal authorities will decide whether she should be extradited to the United States; Beijing has called for her immediate release.\n\u201cIt seems that, to some people, only Canadian citizens shall be treated in a humanitarian manner and their freedom deemed valuable, while Chinese people do not deserve that,\u201d Mr. Lu wrote in his op-ed.\nThe ambassador also said that people in the West had applied double standards in their treatment of Huawei itself. Canadians, he wrote, have \u201cconveniently ignored\u201d revelations about global surveillance activities by the United States and its allies.\n\u201cSomething is considered as \u2018safeguarding national security\u2019 when it is done by Western countries,\u201d Mr. Lu wrote. \u201cBut it is termed \u2018conducting espionage\u2019 when done by China.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/asia/china-ambassador-canada-white-supremacy.html", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.43948"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.19420"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.13673"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.09011"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.08295"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.06451"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.04920"}, {"label": "china-international relations-us", "score": "0.04278"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.03757"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.03300"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.02876"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.02788"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.02610"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02126"}, {"label": "suspensions, dismissals and resignations", "score": "0.02056"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.01938"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.01779"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.01708"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.01259"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.01139"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.01108"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.01095"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01080"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.01054"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00828"}, {"label": "mergers, acquisitions and divestitures", "score": "0.00801"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.00760"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.00729"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.00703"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.00697"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["China", "Canada", "China", "Canada", "Beijing", "Canada", "Ottawa", "Beijing", "Canada", "China", "the United States", "China", "The United States", "Beijing", "New York", "the United States", "Iran", "Canada", "China", "China", "Vancouver", "British Columbia", "the United States", "Beijing", "the United States", "China"], "ORG": ["The Hill Times", "Huawei", "Global Affairs Canada", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei", "Huawei"], "PERSON": ["Lu Shaye", "Meng Wanzhou", "Lu", "Guillaume B\u00e9rub\u00e9", "Meng", "Meng", "Meng", "Meng", "Meng", "Michael Kovrig", "Michael Spavor", "Meng", "Meng", "Lu", "Lu"]}}, {"index": 59, "year": 1999, "title": "Digital Commerce: Consumers' Desire for Information Privacy Ignored", "url": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/08/biztech/articles/30digi.html", "text_content": "August 30, 1999\nDIGITAL COMMERCE\nConsumers' Desire for Information Privacy Ignored\nBy DENISE CARUSO\nf privacy is indeed the pivotal concern for people who use data networks -- and by every objective indication to date, it is -- then why are companies and\nlaw enforcement agencies still getting away with monitoring and collecting, and using and selling, as much of our personal data as they can get their hands on?\nWhat is it about \"no\" that these folks don't understand?\n|\n||\n|\nTom Bloom\n|\n|\nSeveral new, sweeping Internet surveillance initiatives, for example, have been introduced by the Clinton White House over the last few weeks -- including one that would monitor private industries for illegal transactions.\nAnother would allow law enforcement agents with a court order to secretly enter private homes or offices to \"wiretap\" the hard disks and Internet connections of computer users.\nEven the Federal Trade Commission, which a few years ago had shown such enthusiasm for making Internet-based businesses toe the consumer privacy line, has backed down from consumer advocacy and is now advocating for industry.

Anthony, who said in a written statement to a Senate subcommittee in July that she was dismayed by the results of studies that show a gap as large as\n89 percent between the number of sites that gather personal information and those that post substantive privacy policies.

Kennard, who said the agency would appeal the decision, those rules were the result of a request by Congress to provide \"meaningful protection\nfor consumers' privacy rights.\"\nThe FCC rules had required phone companies to get explicit permission from their customers -- a method known as \"opt in\" -- before using or sharing customers' records, calling patterns and other personal information\nto market new services to them.\n\"You call your doctor, your clergyman, your therapist,\" Kennard said. \"You order products. And when you pick up that telephone, most consumers have no earthly idea that call might be used by someone to market\nanother service to them. When you pick up that telephone, you should have ownership of that information. It's the way we live our lives and it's private to us.\"\nBut in a 2-1 ruling published on Aug. 18, which has obvious implications for the data-hungry Internet economy, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that rules protecting consumers from having information like the numbers\nthey call and the services they subscribe to used without their permission interfered with the phone companies' First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\"Although we may feel uncomfortable knowing that our personal information is circulating in the world,\" the ruling said, \"we live in an open society where information may pass freely.\"\nOne wonders how many circuit court judges would be willing to have the form and substance of their phone bills \"pass freely\" among the employees of U S West or its partners.\nThe court's decision does not allow U S West and others to sell proprietary customer data to outsiders, but it does give the telephone companies permission to scrutinize this highly personal data -- data gathered only\nas a byproduct of subscribing to their services -- without the subscribers' explicit permission. Not incidentally, it gives the companies an enormous edge over others selling competing services.\nKennard said he was disappointed that the court came down on the side of the business interests of telephone companies. \"If that's the way privacy laws will be interpreted,\" he said, \"then I think consumers\nwill have a lot to worry about.\"\nOddly enough, the ruling -- which, if it stands, would seem to hamper any future attempts to limit the ability of companies to disclose consumers' personal information -- got very little play in the national news media.\nCertainly, the victorious companies -- U S West, Vodaphone Airtouch, Sprint, SBC Communications, MCI Worldcom, Bell South and Frontier -- did little to call attention to the ruling.\nAnd who can blame them? Consumers do not like it when companies do not protect their privacy, as Amazon.com found out this week when it started publishing lists of its products purchased by specific companies, nonprofit groups\nand government agencies. But refusing to flaunt data mining and refusing to practice it are two different matters. \"The technology generates a lot of information that's very valuable, and everybody wants to get\ntheir hands on it,\" says David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.\nSobel does not buy the \"corporate First Amendment\" argument that he said won the day for U S West et al. \"We do, in fact, have existing federal laws that restrict companies from disclosing personal information,\nlike video rentals,\" he said. \"It's not a violation of free speech rights to forbid people to divulge inside information. Why should it be a violation to pass laws restricting the use of private data?\"\nAnd Kennard said he saw a broader issue around the collection of detailed consumer data in every transaction from the supermarket scanner to the credit-card number on the Internet. \"As a society, we have to come up with\na way of protecting that information for benefit of consumers,\" he said. \"It doesn't necessarily mean that government has to do it, but government is certainly a logical place for it to be done if industry\nisn't going to step up to the plate.\"\nMs. Anthony, the FTC commissioner, has also become a believer in a government role. In her statement to the Senate subcommittee, she wrote that \"industry progress has been far too slow\" since the FTC encouraged voluntary\nfair information practices in 1996. \"I believe that the time is ripe for federal legislation to establish at least baseline minimum standards upon which meaningful self-regulation can flourish.\"\nAnd despite their protests, that may be the only \"no\" that industry will understand.\nClick here for a list of links to other Digital Commerce columns.\nRelated Sites\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability.", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/08/biztech/articles/30digi.html", "tags": [{"label": "privacy", "score": "0.95921"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.86669"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.31851"}, {"label": "privacy, right of", "score": "0.17986"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.13862"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.09128"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.08306"}, {"label": "wiretapping and other eavesdropping devices and methods", "score": "0.05991"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.05622"}, {"label": "regulation and deregulation of industry", "score": "0.05517"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.04713"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.04346"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.04312"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.04031"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.03551"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03268"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.02960"}, {"label": "consumer protection", "score": "0.02561"}, {"label": "standards and standardization", "score": "0.02417"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02318"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.02217"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.02095"}, {"label": "internet and world wide web", "score": "0.02085"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.02062"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.01572"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.01557"}, {"label": "telephones", "score": "0.01501"}, {"label": "prices (fares, fees and rates)", "score": "0.01482"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01408"}, {"label": "internet (computer network)", "score": "0.01395"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Denver", "Washington"], "ORG": ["DIGITAL COMMERCE\n", "DENISE CARUSO", "White House", "the Federal Trade Commission", "Congress on Self-Regulation", "FTC", "Senate", "U S West", "FCC", "the Federal Communications Commission", "Congress", "FCC", "U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals", "U S West", "U S West", "Vodaphone Airtouch", "Sprint", "SBC Communications", "MCI Worldcom", "Bell South", "Frontier", "Amazon.com", "the Electronic Privacy Information Center", "U S West et al", "FTC", "Senate", "FTC", "Digital Commerce", "The New York Times", "Times"], "PERSON": ["Tom Bloom", "Clinton", "Sheila F.

Nearly 80,000 people died in the United States.\nThe number of deaths from flu this season has not yet been determined. But Dr. Fry said the flu was widespread in 30 states, especially in the Southeast, and is moving northward. Levels are also high in New York City and New Jersey.\nAnd the number of hospitalizations so far this season \u201cis a reminder that flu can cause severe illness,\u201d Dr. Fry added.\nDespite the warnings, many people still do not realize how dangerous the flu can be. The death last month of Bre Payton, 26, a writer for a conservative online newsmagazine and a guest commentator on the Fox News Channel, came as a shock to many. She died after becoming ill with the flu and developing encephalitis, a brain inflammation.\nThe very young, the very old, pregnant women and people with underlying health problems have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill and needing hospitalization for the flu, according to the C.D.C. In healthy people, the sickness usually lasts three to five days, but the cough can linger.\n[What parents need to know about this flu season]\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not too late to get vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Fry said.\nThe vaccine needs about two weeks to take effect, she said, but is still worth getting because the flu season is expected to drag on longer than that. The effectiveness of this year\u2019s vaccine is not known yet, but in past years, Dr. Fry said, vaccination against the same type of flu that is now circulating \u2014 known as H1N1 \u2014 was about 50 percent to 60 percent effective at reducing the likelihood of a person needing to visit the doctor with symptoms.\nAntiviral drugs, available by prescription only, can shorten the illness slightly and lessen its severity, but they work best if taken as early as possible after symptoms appear. In a statement, the C.D.C. said, \u201cPeople who are very sick or who are at high risk of serious flu complications and get flu symptoms should see a health care provider quickly for possible treatment with a flu antiviral drug.\u201d\nAlthough influenza has already caused deaths this season, the figure has not been released because there is not enough information yet to make a reliable estimate, said Carrie Reed, who led the applied research and modeling team that produced the estimates.\nNor is it possible to determine how this flu season compares with others based on these numbers, as this is the first time that the C.D.C. has provided flu estimates while the season is still underway. In the past, the totals were released after the flu season had ended.\nDr. Fry said her team had decided to gather and report the numbers early because they realized that people found the data useful. From now on, updated totals will be published every Friday in the C.D.C.\u2019s weekly FluView report.\nEven though flu viruses contain only eight genes, compared with about 20,000 in humans, they manage to wreak a great deal of havoc. During the last flu season, from 2017 to 2018, about 48.8 million people caught the illness, 22.7 million saw a doctor, 959,000 were hospitalized and 79,400 died. The number of cases last season was the highest since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when 60 million people got sick.\nDr. Fry said it was not possible to use the current estimates to project what the total number of cases might be this season.\n\u201cWe are very actively pursuing methods to forecast what could be happening in the short term and when the season might peak,\u201d Dr. Fry said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know for several more weeks whether it\u2019s peaked.\u201d\nThe estimates are based on data collected from a surveillance network that counts flu-related hospitalizations in parts of 13 states scattered around the country, covering about 27 million people, or 8.5 percent of the nation\u2019s population.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/health/flu-widespread-cdc-.html", "tags": [{"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.69485"}, {"label": "diseases and conditions", "score": "0.65270"}, {"label": "influenza", "score": "0.38686"}, {"label": "vaccination and immunization", "score": "0.08246"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.04305"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.02675"}, {"label": "epidemics", "score": "0.02585"}, {"label": "viruses", "score": "0.02092"}, {"label": "shutdowns (institutional)", "score": "0.01789"}, {"label": "hospitals", "score": "0.00985"}, {"label": "drugs (pharmaceuticals)", "score": "0.00984"}, {"label": "health, personal", "score": "0.00972"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.00888"}, {"label": "acquired immune deficiency syndrome", "score": "0.00780"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.00764"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.00755"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00604"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00592"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.00546"}, {"label": "prices (fares, fees and rates)", "score": "0.00538"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.00517"}, {"label": "terms not available", "score": "0.00456"}, {"label": "health insurance and managed care", "score": "0.00453"}, {"label": "anatomy and physiology", "score": "0.00453"}, {"label": "weather", "score": "0.00421"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.00419"}, {"label": "consumer protection", "score": "0.00362"}, {"label": "insurance", "score": "0.00322"}, {"label": "deaths", "score": "0.00321"}, {"label": "food", "score": "0.00312"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["U.S.", "the United States", "the United States", "New York City", "New Jersey"], "ORG": ["the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention", "C.D.C.", "C.D.C.", "the Fox News Channel", "C.D.C.", "C.D.C.", "C.D.C.", "C.D.C.", "FluView"], "PERSON": ["Alicia Fry", "Fry", "Fry", "Bre Payton", "Fry", "Fry", "Carrie Reed", "Fry", "Fry", "Fry"]}}, {"index": 61, "year": 2019, "title": "Along the U.S.-Mexico Border", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/10/world/americas/crossing-us-mexico-border.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "CALIFORNIA\nARIZONA\nPhoenix\nEND\nEl Centro\nNEW MEXICO\nYuma\nTijuana\nMexicali\nTucson\nEl Paso\nDouglas\nCiudad\nJu\u00e1rez\nTEXAS\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nNogales\nAgua Prieta\nMEXICO\nHouston\nHermosillo\nDel Rio\nSan Antonio\nPiedras\nNegras\nGULF OF\nMEXICO\nLaredo\nNuevo\nLaredo\nMcAllen\nReynosa\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIFORNIA\nARIZONA\nPhoenix\nEND\nEl Centro\nNEW MEXICO\nYuma\nTijuana\nMexicali\nTucson\nEl Paso\nDouglas\nCiudad\nJu\u00e1rez\nTEXAS\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nNogales\nAgua Prieta\nMEXICO\nHouston\nHermosillo\nDel Rio\nSan Antonio\nPiedras\nNegras\nGULF OF\nMEXICO\nLaredo\nNuevo\nLaredo\nMcAllen\nReynosa\nSTART\nBrownsville\nAlbuquerque\nCALIFORNIA\nARIZONA\nPhoenix\nEl Centro\nNEW MEXICO\nYuma\nEND\nTijuana\nTucson\nTEXAS\nEl Paso\nDouglas\nCiudad\nJu\u00e1rez\nNogales\nAgua Prieta\nMEXICO\nHouston\nHermosillo\nDel Rio\nSan Antonio\nPiedras\nNegras\nLaredo\nNuevo\nLaredo\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nMcAllen\nReynosa\nSTART\nBrownsville\nGULF\nOF\nMEXICO\nCALIFORNIA\nARIZONA\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEl Centro\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nEl Paso\nNogales\nDel Rio\nMEXICO\nPiedras\nNegras\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nGULF\nOF\nMEXICO\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEl Centro\nEND\nTijuana\nEl Paso\nTEXAS\nNogales\nDel Rio\nMEXICO\nPiedras\nNegras\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nMeridith Kohut traveled back to Venezuela, where she is based, to cover recent events.

From the crossing between San Ysidro in San Diego and El Chaparral in Tijuana, one can see earlier, less foreboding iterations of the wall, like the one signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\nDay 42\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nDay 42\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nIn the years since, the wall has been added to, adjusted and amplified \u2014 a living testament of sorts to the enduring and often political nature of wall-building along the border.\nOn the immigration issue, Tijuana has long been a hot spot of political and media attention, a sort of stand-in for the border writ large, however mistaken the idea.\nAnd it was no different on a recent visit.\nThanks to the arrival in the city of thousands of migrants, traveling in caravans for safe passage from Central America, and because of the hectoring focus of President Trump, Tijuana has attracted the bulk of attention.\nIt has become the flash point and symbol for all that is happening along the border: the supposed chaos, the real desperation and the political crisis that has both bound and distanced the governments of the United States and Mexico.\nAnd so it was on a recent Friday that dozens of journalists, lawyers and aid workers gathered in the concrete plaza just outside the Tijuana crossing, waiting for the latest chapter in the border crisis to unfold.\nIn an awkwardly coordinated effort, the American and Mexican governments had announced that they would start a \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program.\nThe policy was aimed at forcing asylum seekers to the United States to return to Mexico while they awaited a decision on their application.\nThe decision was sudden, and for migrants, devastating.\nHaving endured the trek north, through routes brimming with thieves and smugglers, the migrants found that the road to asylum in the United States would end, for now, in Mexico.\nThe United States applauded what it called a binational effort.\nMexican officials insisted, however, that the plan was forced on them and that they had no say in the matter, but that they would take the asylum seekers back in the spirit of humanitarianism.\nThose gathered to respond to the ramifications of the deal \u2014 reporters to cover it, along with lawyers and activists to offer counsel and assistance \u2014 filled the plaza in tribal clusters and waited for a returnee to pass back through the gates, which would be a repudiation of decades of asylum practices in the United States.\nInstead, the only thing that passed through the crowd was rumor.\nSomeone heard that the first returnee was due at any moment. Within seconds, a line of journalists staged themselves in front of the exit. A family approached, carrying suitcases and small bags. They paused to look at the phalanx of journalists, then passed without a word. They were not the returnees.\nAs the crowd waited for someone to come back, white vans were lined up in a parking lot, preparing to take another set of migrants across to apply for asylum.\nVolunteer aid workers stood pressed against the white metal bars, whispering goodbyes and shedding tears.\nThey grew hostile as journalists took pictures, with a few of the volunteers shouting at the photographers to stop. These were asylum seekers under threat, the volunteers said, and they could be endangered if their image surfaced in the media.\nWhen that request didn\u2019t work, the volunteers began sticking their hands in front of cameras to block them. A few tugged at camera straps. A Mexican journalist took issue with an American activist.\n\u201cI have a right to do this,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m following the law, in my country. When I\u2019m in your country, I\u2019ll follow the law there. But don\u2019t tell me how to act in my country.\u201d\nHis aggressor recoiled, and then claimed the high ground. She told the crowd she was prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the migrants, who seemed to have no problem at all with the journalists taking pictures and asking questions.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a black eye if I have to,\u201d she announced, although the threat she seemed to be describing wasn\u2019t immediately apparent. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s worth it to protect these people.\u201d\nThe standoff continued for a few more minutes, until the vans had loaded everyone up and driven away.\nThe knot of journalists and activists loosened, and eventually, with no sign of any returnees, everyone left.\nFour days later, the first returnee, a bleary-eyed Honduran man worn from his multiday ordeal, would pass back into Mexico. Upon entry, he was whisked away by Mexican officials before he could be interviewed.\nIf theatricality has become a reality along the border here, one could argue that Mr. Trump is its full-time producer.\nThe language of crisis and chaos, however unfounded, has prompted a wave of coverage, especially in the United States.\nIn Mexico, forcing migrants to wait months to cross and apply for asylum has left thousands in a state of man-made crisis.\nSome leave. Others find work in Mexico and wait for better days, or cross illegally elsewhere. A few have attempted to rush the wall, only to be beaten back with tear gas.\nThose images can lend credence to the border-as-chaos plotline \u2014 that the United States is under threat and that only walls and deterrence can protect it. That anyone, if given the chance, would gladly sneak across to make a new life in the United States.\nBut where the border comes to its western end, where the wall dives into the Pacific Ocean and its barnacled stanchions split the crashing surf, another image prevails.\nOn the United States side, the beach is abandoned, undeveloped, barren. In the distance, San Diego is barely discernible in the evening haze.\nThe entire beachfront on the Mexico side pulses with life. The portraits of misery and desperation give way to a Friday on the beach in Tijuana.\nA child runs in circles on the damp sand, screaming with delight as a small dog chases close behind. A group of hippies dance in a drum circle. Young couples saunter down to the water\u2019s edge to snap selfies in front of the wall.\nMusic rains down from the short bluffs overhead, as restaurants and bars begin to fill. Families spread blankets on the sand to watch the sunset. Beachfront stands sell sticks of grilled shrimp.\nAn openness prevails. Amid the cacophony, a brass band begins a set of folk tunes, a sonic dissonance no one seems to mind.\nAJO, Ariz. \u2014 \"A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\"\nSo begins Section 2 (c) of the Wilderness Act of 1964, a federal law that today protects some 110 million acres of land in the United States.\nIt is also, today, being used to underpin a criminal complaint that has sent chills through the immigrant rights community.\nDay 26,\nAjo\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nDay 26,\nAjo\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nLast year, federal prosecutors charged a group of activists with illegally entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southern Arizona, a rugged area that spans some 800,000 acres of sepia-toned desert and pleated mountains along the border with Mexico.\nTheir crime: entering without permits to leave supplies for migrants crossing into the United States.\nFour people from the group, No More Deaths, were convicted this month, and more face trial.\nThough not the first time the government has gone after the activists, the breadth of the campaign against them, and the use of the Wilderness Act, appears to be a first.\nOrdinarily, people caught wandering the refuge without a permit might be sent off with a warning or perhaps a summons. The Trump administration opted for the most severe approach.\n\u201cThe cases are on their surface about wilderness, but I think sitting in the courtroom and watching the trial really laid bare the fact that it\u2019s not just about wilderness,\u201d said Parker Deighan, one of the volunteers awaiting trial on a misdemeanor charge in the case. \u201cIt is about targeting humanitarian aid and targeting care for folks who cross the border.\u201d\nIn convicting the activists, a federal judge said their actions had eroded \u201cthe national decision to maintain the refuge in its pristine nature.\u201d And \u201cpristine\u201d is a word that could be easily applied to much of the border area. Tracts of ridged desert populated by barrel cactus and giant saguaros that hug the skyline are untouched reservation land for 75 miles of the border.\nAnd yet a wall could be coming. This despite the fact that one already exists.\nThe government\u2019s action against the activists, whatever the legal merit, raises broader questions along the border, in particular here, where Arizona abuts its Mexican counterpart, Sonora.\nAmong them: Who exactly owns the land and gets to say what can or cannot be done to it? Who can make permanent man\u2019s touch on the wilderness, and who suffers for it?\nA short drive from Cabeza Prieta lie lands held by the people of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which the tribe has occupied for centuries. Here, the trammeling of the land has been authored exclusively by the American government in its campaign to seal off the dry edges of the United States.\n\u201cIt is sort of a contradiction what they are doing here,\u201d Verlon Jose, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation vice chairman, said on a recent tour through a section of the nearly three million acres granted to the tribe. \u201cNo one wants this wall, and they are saying they are going to build it anyways.\u201d\nThe tribe has occupied the land for thousands of years, since before there were countries to separate with borders. Its land once stretched from central Arizona all the way down to Hermosillo, Mexico, but geopolitics forced a retreat.\nToday, the tribe is fighting to preserve what\u2019s left. Mr. Jose and others are in a pitched battle to halt the construction of any more walls on their land, which is a wilderness in all but name, replete with saguaro forests, untamed brush and tracts of desert arroyo and washes that flood every spring.\nThe wall that exists now is a welded chain of X-barriers that form a straight line across the southern edge of Tohono O\u2019odham land. To the side, a dirt road has been scratched out of the plains.\nThis was, to many on the reservation, already a sore point.\nMore than 2,000 members of the tribe are registered in Mexico. Graveyards sit across the fencing in place now, accessible through a few unmanned border gates exclusively for tribe members.\nA new wall would upend nature entirely \u2014 from the unspoiled views across a landscape indifferent to borders to the animal life whose free passage between sides would end.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our backyard,\u201d said Mr. Jose. \u201cThere\u2019s not just the physical effect of a wall. It\u2019s psychological and emotional as well.\u201d\nBOQUILLAS DEL CARMEN, Mexico \u2014 The land here is indifferent to division, heeding no borders as nature claims both sides in its staggering sweep.\nThe limestone cliffs soaring 1,500 feet over the banks of the Rio Grande are mirror images of one another on either side of the Texas and Mexico divide.

The boats that ferried tourists across the river had stopped. Two restaurants that opened to serve a nascent industry were shuttered, for the moment.\n\u201cThe shutdown came in our peak season,\u201d said Veronica Ureste, 32, a lifelong resident of Boquillas del Carmen, who sells artisanal products to tourists. She was standing in her kitchen as driving rain pelted her roof and intensified a general feeling of gloom. \u201cWe work during this tourist season to survive for the whole year.\u201d\nSurvival has been a relatively constant state of being for the people of Boquillas, which is nestled along a low bluff and is five hours from the nearest big town by alternating patches of paved and dirt road.\nUntil tourism came along following the reopening of the river crossing in recent years, people were abandoning their homes to find opportunities elsewhere.\nAcross the now-impassable river, Big Bend National Park, which sweeps over the southern edge of Texas to the banks of the Rio Grande, felt similarly forlorn amid a monthlong, partial government shutdown.\nTraffic had slowed there, too. Cars seldom pass. Campgrounds sit empty. On the most popular trails, tourists who made plans months earlier trudged through the natural habitat, equally frustrated and thrilled by the solitude.\nPhyllis and John Brewster were up early, hiking the Santa Elena Canyon in the sunless morning chill with a handful of other visitors. Mrs. Brewster glanced toward Mexico, and at the sheer rock wall that marked its start.\nNot much happening on that side, from what she could see.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a natural boundary,\u201d said Mrs. Brewster, 76, a retired elementary schoolteacher from Grosse Pointe, Mich., as she made her way up a walkway etched into the cliffs. \u201cWhat the heck do you need a wall for?\u201d\nMr. Brewster, a retired veterinarian and lifelong Republican, stood quietly, staring out over the flood plain and the narrow river at its center.\n\u201cThe migrants ought to know about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to cross the river.\u201c\nMr. Brewster wasn\u2019t an obvious opponent of the current administration\u2019s border policy. He voted for Donald J. Trump in 2016, a revelation that surprised even his wife. At the time, he said, couldn\u2019t bring himself to go with a Democrat.\nNow, more than two years on, the scandals, the nativist language and the vitriol are just too much for him. He said he hated that none of his fellow Republicans seem willing to do anything about it. And he hates what he sees as the demonization of migrants trying to reach the United States.\nAnd now, here he was, in a nearly empty and unattended national park, bereft of personnel to police the border. Even the weather seemed intransigent \u2014 a dense fog refused to lift, practically plugging the canyon shut.\nThe Brewsters did missionary work in Central America. They knew people there, he said. Good people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty to close down a country,\u201d he said, shaking his head slowly. \u201cThese people are escaping serious problems for a better life. All of our ancestors were immigrants at one point. To do this is a sinful act.\u201d\nPIEDRAS NEGRAS, Mexico \u2014 Stripped to their underwear, the small group of boys stood shivering on one of the bridge\u2019s footings, pausing in the bitter cold to reconsider their crossing.\nThey were nearly halfway across the Rio Grande, headed for Eagle Pass, Tex. Their clothes lay in a soggy pile to one side of them, discarded to reduce the drag on their remaining swim to the other side, where United States Customs and Border Protection agents lined the banks of the river waiting for them.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 14,\nPiedras Negras\nCOAHUILA\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nDay 14,\nPiedras Negras\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nCOAHUILA\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nBorder patrol airboats circled nearby, passing beneath the bridge as the boys \u2014 most of them teenagers from Honduras \u2014 pondered whether to return to the frigid water.\nOn the Mexican side, people lined the riverfront esplanade to watch, quieted by the spectacle of despair. Locals pressed up against the hand railings to get a better look. So did migrants, who were not crossing with the boys but wished them well.\n\u201cThis is how you apply for asylum now,\u201d said Oscar Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a 21-year-old Honduran, bracing against the cold as he watched his countrymen\u2019s trip across the river. He was not going with them. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it across any other way.\u201d\nOnly one of the boys managed to reach the American side, in a final, frantic paddle. As soon as he reached the bank, he was gathered up by uniformed agents and whisked away in a S.U.V.\nThe other swimmers gave up, boarded the airboats and were brought back to the banks of Mexico, where they had started and where ambulances now waited.\nBefore a new border wall became the focal point of a bitter national debate in the United States, and the cause of what is now a monthlong partial government shutdown, most asylum seekers simply crossed the international footbridge that connects Eagle Pass with Piedras Negras. Migrants were allowed to enter, apply for asylum \u2014 and then wait for a decision.\nToday, border agents operate a checkpoint installed in the center of the bridge, which allows them to turn migrants back before they can enter United States territory.\nThis leaves migrants with few options.\nThey can go home, which few do, having come so far already. Or they can look for other ways across, often illegal ones.\nMexico is unsafe almost everywhere it touches the United States, and Piedras Negras, a city of about 165,000 people, is no exception, despite notching some recent improvements in security.\nOne asylum-seeking family from El Salvador was recently kidnapped here after it was turned away by United States agents, according to statements given to the American Civil Liberties Union. The family was forced to negotiate bribes to Mexican authorities before their release could be secured.\nIt then took lawyers from the A.C.L.U. accompanying the family members for a second attempt at asylum before they were successful and processed at the port of entry in El Paso, hundreds of miles away.\nMost asylum seekers do not have the luxury of legal assistance, subjected to the vagaries of a system unevenly, crudely and sometime cruelly applied. And as the Trump administration turns up the pressure, their desperation has only intensified .\nBut not their resolve.\nThe desperation differs from crossing point to crossing point, our journey along the border has found.\nIn some places, it's overcrowded migrant shelters. At others, its squalid encampments on bridges. Here in Piedras Negras, it\u2019s children screwing up the courage to plunge into the cold water and the swift currents.\nAnd yet the migrants continue arriving at the border every day, some from as far away as Cameroon, traversing half the globe to find a new life in the United States.\nBut this part of Mexico is a good reminder that not all border stories run from south to north.\nIn the town of M\u00fazquiz, a few dozen miles from the border at Piedras Negras, the members of the Kickapoo tribe reside on a reservation granted to them by the Mexican government more than 150 years ago. Fleeing the brutality of American soldiers and marauders of the Old West, the tribes members crossed south into Mexico for safety, where they stayed and preserved their traditions.\n\u201cThe border protected us,\u201d said Andres Aniko, the spiritual leader of the Kickapoo in the Mexican state of Coahuila. \u201cIt stopped the white man from coming over here.\u201d\nThe Kickapoo enjoy dual citizenship, and are allowed to cross the border without visas, though many are content to remain in Mexico.\n\u201cWe found peace here,\u201d Mr. Aniko said from the tribe\u2019s reservation, which is largely off limits to outsiders. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons we have been able to preserve our traditions. We were isolated here.\u201d\nNUEVO LAREDO, Mexico \u2013 Thirteen thousand trucks a day. A million dollars a minute.\nThat, on average, is the value of the cargo that crosses the border between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo on the United States-Mexico border.\nHere, between the two Laredos, the border is booming. Trucks loaded with everything from car parts to packaged food hum across a bridge that has been especially designated for commerce, making it the largest land port in the Americas.\n\u201cWe are the heart of Nafta,\u201d says Edgardo Pedraza, the head of the Customs Brokers Association in Nuevo Laredo, who insists on being called Gary. \u201cI think of the two sides as one Laredo.\u201d\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nDay 8,\nNuevo Laredo\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 8,\nNuevo Laredo\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nGary himself has dual nationality, and is married to an American citizen. His children go to school in the United States, and the family has homes on both sides of the border.\nGeographically, the two cities practically run into each other, bisected only by the Rio Grande. Children cross from Mexico to the United States to attend school. Workers cross, too, as do shoppers, who return with outlet mall bags at all hours of the day.\nThe two cities share a baseball team, and a history dating back a century and a half. Spanish is spoken on both sides, forging a cultural bond distinct to border towns.\nNeither side wants the wall. The river, for most, is border enough.\nBut even here, there is a stark difference in the freedom of movement of goods versus people.\nEvery day, hundreds of Mexicans, many with wives and children still living in the United States, are deported and dropped off in Nuevo Laredo.\n\u201cWe have grown so much with the United States in terms of trade, commerce and technology,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Carmona Flores, the head of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency tasked with managing the return to Mexico of tens of thousands of migrants. \u201cBut we have never really been able to achieve this with the flow of people.\u201d\nMr. Carmona had just finished a welcome session for deported migrants, a class of largely men haggard from spending a varying number of weeks in detention on the American side.\nMr. Carmona spoke to them as a coach might to the players of a losing team. He told them they were special \u2013 not just anyone could make the passage north as they had done. They worked harder than most, clocking in 14-hour days in the United States, and Mexico needed them.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t work like you guys,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople may look at your tattoos, earrings or the way you walk and wonder what you\u2019re all about,\u201d he added, miming a tough-guy walk that elicited a round of laughter from the men.\n\u201cThe truth is, you guys are going to replace us, you work harder than we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need you. We need you to lift this country up.\u201d\nA few faces crumpled, the men caught off guard by the kind words. One man began to weep. Afterward, Mr. Carmona sent them off to grab a meal before their bus trips back home.\n\u201cMost of them, when they return, it\u2019s their dignity that\u2019s suffered the most,\u201d he later explained. \u201cOur job is to lift them up and tell them how important they are, to respect the sacrifices they made.\u201d\nTo help them acclimate, Mr. Carmona called in a pair of executives from a trucking company to register anyone interested in a job. With a nationwide shortfall of more than 200,000 drivers, the company promised good wages, at least by Mexican standards.\nJust past the American customs checkpoint on the Texas side, a torpid groan fills the air as tractor-trailers ease past in quick succession, destined for states across America.\nDrivers queue on the raised surface of a traffic island, waiting for their rigs to clear the booth and for the start of their shifts.\n\u201cWe need the U.S. and the U.S. needs us, too,\u201d Jonathan Gamboa, a 29-year-old driver from Mexico, said one recent morning.\nMr. Gamboa accepts his place in the order of things: He has a visa that lets him transit through the United States, but not live there. He could make a good living driving on the American side, but that was it.\n\u201cEvery day the merchandise crosses and I cross with it,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m O.K. with that. I just can\u2019t live in Texas.\u201d\n\"The Daily\" is sending audio dispatches from this trip. Listen here.\nFALFURRIAS, Tex. \u2013 It\u2019s about an hour-and-a-half drive from the nearest border crossing to the town of Falfurrias, the seat of Brooks County, Tex.\nFrom the highway, Texas unfurls in wide sheets of scrubland, dense understories of small trees and thorny brush that rise in gnarled stands along the sandy plains. Patches of mesquite, blackbrush and huisache crowd the horizon.\nLike the border itself, which lies some 80 miles away, it is an unwelcoming place for migrants.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nDay 5,\nFalfurrias\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 5,\nFalfurrias\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nMore than 700 have perished in transit through Brooks County over the last 15 years, claimed by heat and dehydration while trying to find their way along the parched tracts of ranchland. The real number is surely higher. The local sheriff, Benny Martinez, thinks only one in five is ever found.\nMigrants disperse here after crossing into the United States, avoiding a border patrol checkpoint. They trek through the dried-out terrain, seeking shade under the boughs of live oaks. Hunters occasionally stumble across hats, empty water jugs and leathered remains banked against trees.\nIn spite of the risk, migrants continue to make the journey through the wilds of Brooks County year after year, carried along by hope. And every year, dozens die. No one believes his or her journey will end like this. They can't. Here, the dead do not teach the living.\nFor years, the remains were conveyed to the county cemetery in Falfurrias, then interred in the open space along its peripheries, often in plots too small or poorly located to sell.\nNo one is quite sure how many were buried; until 2013, the county kept no records.\nBut Eddie Canales, the founder of the South Texas Human Rights Center, has forced the remains into the open, hoping to rescue them from anonymity.\nSince 2013, anthropologists have been coming with their students to exhume the bodies and extract DNA samples. With no maps or records, they dig narrow trenches guided by the memories of local gravediggers. The samples are then cross-referenced with missing person databases.\nOf the more than 150 remains unearthed in this cemetery, 30 have been identified.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the families of the missing,\u201d said Kate Spradley, a forensic anthropologist from Texas State University overseeing the effort.\nDr. Spradley stood nearby as a team of students brushed the dirt away from a set of remains buried several feet deep. A worn trash bag, blistered by age, held the bleached bones stacked neatly inside.\nAbove that, packed into the soil, she spotted the faint traces of calcified bone poking through the grit. Another body. That made 16 exhumed in just under a week.\nThe bodies tell their own stories, Dr. Spradley explained. One man carried photocopied money in his pockets to throw off robbers. Others are buried with stuffed animals. Some are buried clothed; others as skeletons, having died long before they were found.\nEach new discovery brings conflicting emotions, a sense of satisfaction tempered by sorrow. She wonders if they will ever find all of the remains.\n\u201cYou look around and you just think, \u2018There\u2019s an open space, there\u2019s an open space,\u2019\u201d she said, scanning the verdant grounds, where fresh cut flowers lay against polished headstones. \u201cAnd there could be a migrant buried anywhere there.\u201d\nShe paused for a moment. The sound of shovels striking dirt filled the cemetery.\n\u201cI always think, you know, what if one of my family members went to another country and never came back,\u201d she said. \u201cWould anyone pick up the phone to help me? And if they picked up the phone, would they care enough to help me?\u201d\nFew did care here until 2013, when 130 bodies were found -- the largest number the county has ever recorded. It wasn\u2019t that 130 died that year, only that, whether because drought cleared out more brush or out of plain dumb chance, they found that many remains.\nThat was when Mr. Canales decided to come out of retirement to found the human rights center, after a career as a union organizer. A 70-year-old Texan with an easy laugh, he applied the same principles to human rights as he did to union organizing.\n\u201cDeveloping a connection, basically,\u201d he said, as he drove the public roads that demarcate thousands of acres of ranch land. \u201cAnd then, you know, I mean, I'm still the same pushy guy.\u201d\nMr. Canales was on his way to replenish water stations that he maintains for migrants passing through. A little more work for him might mean a little less for the gravediggers. The large blue bins sit along the roadside every half-mile or so, and carry up to six gallons of fresh water. He\u2019s planted a flag near most, to help migrants spot them from the brush.\nOccasionally, people steal the barrels or puncture them to deter migrants. Canales brushes this off. \u201cYou gotta be able to laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to do this work.\u201d\nIn the borderlands, of course, not everything is dark and serious. People live their lives as they do anywhere. Whatever the broader political debate, to most, this place is just home. And for some, it feels as though politicians who know little about the area are just trying to gain political points.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no crisis or state of emergency here,\u201d said Phillip G\u00f3mez.\nMr. G\u00f3mez was seated at the Jalisco Restaurant along the edge of the highway into town. The television was on over the bar, playing the highlights of President Trump\u2019s speech in McAllen, Tex., about an hour and a half drive away.\nBut no one was paying attention to that. The D.J. was gearing up for karaoke night. Regulars began filing in, introducing themselves to diners as if they owned the place.\nMr. G\u00f3mez, a 64-year-old technician for DirecTV, sported a white handlebar mustache, plaid shirt and cowboy hat with a pair of sunglasses perched on top. He remained seated while he sang a slightly off-tune rendition of \u201cThe Chair\u201d by George Strait.\nAfterward, he didn\u2019t much care to talk politics, though he allowed that everyone else seemed to want to talk about the border whether they lived there or not.\nThen he talked about the border.\nHe agrees with Mr. Trump, he said, and though he feels bad for migrants fleeing violence, that\u2019s no reason to let everyone just come into the U.S.\n\u201cWhy do people have walls in their backyard?\u201d he asked, passing off the microphone for the second time that night, after a second George Strait song. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want people in there. There\u2019s no difference. Explain the difference to me.\u201d\nMr. G\u00f3mez, who speaks Spanish and whose great-grandparents immigrated from Mexico, doesn\u2019t feel as if the system can bear much more.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for helping people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut too many people are going to bring down our system.\u201d\nBROWNSVILLE \u2014 There are no signs, markers or commemorations.

Just a few fishermen on either side casting into the low tide of an early morning, equally stymied by an indifferent catch.\n\u201cNada,\u201d said Juan Gonz\u00e1lez of his quarry, echoing the deflated sentiment of his counterparts angling on the American side.\nFor Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, a gas station attendant from nearby Matamoros, the border was an afterthought.\n\u201cI guess from here it\u2019s pretty easy to cross,\u201d said Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez, who comes to fish the river\u2019s estuary twice a month and has never made the swim across. Never had any reason to, he said. \u201cHere you don\u2019t have walls and more walls like you do elsewhere.\u201d\nAs the sun burned away the morning haze, a large white surveillance blimp was visible in the distance.\nFor Jos\u00e9 Jes\u00fas Espinoza, who sat at a migrant shelter an hour\u2019s drive away in Matamoros, getting back over the border was all that mattered.\nHis deportation from the United States earlier this week brought him back to Mexico for the first time in 15 years. The border now bisected his life, with his wife and three children still in North Carolina.\nHe would cross again, he knew that much. Legally, if possible. If not, given the current impasse over the border and migration, a wall would not stop him.\n\u201cWe are going to cross one way or another,\u201d he said, offering an incongruous smile. \u201cI mean, we Mexicans have been doing that forever.\u201d\nJust over the bridge, in Brownsville, Tex., Narce G\u00f3mez sat behind the counter of a hierber\u00eda, a store offering tarot card readings, statuettes of saints, herbal remedies and candles.\nHer clientele is largely Mexican-American, a population whose predecessors carried their cultures with them across the border generations before.\nAnd perhaps that was the problem. There was a time, more than a decade back, when the lines of customers formed out the door to enter such shops. Nowadays, they are closing, one by one, as interest wanes.\n\u201cPractically all of this comes from Mexico,\u201d she said, pointing to the disquieting lines of Santa Muerte effigies that lined her shop. \u201cIt crossed along with the people a long time ago.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/10/world/americas/crossing-us-mexico-border.html?partner=rss&emc=rss",

We need to untie the American economy from China.\nDerek Scissors and\nMr. Scissors and Mr. Blumenthal are experts on China at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe Trump administration has been clear about its view of China. A 2017 national security strategy document called China a \u201crevisionist\u201d power attempting to reorder international politics to suit its interests. It\u2019s difficult to think otherwise given Beijing\u2019s military buildup, its attempts to undermine American influence and power, its retaliations against American allies such as Canada, and its economic actions.\nHow to respond is more controversial. After years of unsuccessful talks and handshake deals with Beijing, the United States should change course and begin cutting some of its economic ties with China. Such a separation would stop intellectual property theft, cut off an important source of support to the People\u2019s Liberation Army and hold companies that are involved in Chinese human rights abuses accountable.\nThis will be no easy task. Some industries will have problems finding new suppliers or buyers, and there are entrenched constituencies that support doing business with China. They argue that any pullback could threaten economic growth. But even if American exports to China fell by half, it would be the equivalent of less than one-half of 1 percent of gross domestic product. The cost of reducing Chinese imports is harder to assess, but there are multiple countries that can substitute for China-based production, none of them strategic rivals and trade predators.\nThe United States economy and its national security have been harmed by China\u2019s rampant theft of intellectual property and the requirement that American companies that want to do business in the country hand over their technology. These actions threaten America\u2019s comparative advantage in innovation and its military edge.\nEven uncoerced foreign investment in technology can strengthen the Chinese military-industrial complex, especially since the Communist Party has moved, since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, to a defense industrial policy that translates in English to \u201ccivil-military fusion.\u201d In practice, many Chinese and foreign \u201ccivilian\u201d companies serve as de facto suppliers for the Chinese Army and its technological-industrial base. Residents and visitors are subject to constant visual surveillance, and a nascent \u201csocial credit program\u201d in which disobedience to party dictates is reflected in credit scores, which could affect everything from home purchases to job opportunities. These forms of social control often use technology developed by Western companies.\nThe United States should make major adjustments to its economic relationship with China. Comprehensive tariffs, which harm American consumers and workers unnecessarily, are not the right reaction. But neither are admonishments to \u201cjust let the market work.\u201d\nThe scale of China\u2019s industrial-policy distortions, technology thievery and efforts to modernize its army are too significant for such superficial responses. The American government must intervene in the market when it comes to China, although that intervention should be limited to areas that are genuinely vital to national security, prosperity and democratic values.\nFor example, the United States government should impose sanctions on the Chinese beneficiaries of intellectual property theft and coercion, in cooperation with our allies. This was the legitimate target of the United States trade representative\u2019s original inquiry in August 2017 under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, but the policy steps chosen \u2014 tariffs \u2014 focus on the trade deficit instead of loss of intellectual property.\nRather than across-the-board tariffs, Chinese companies receiving stolen or coerced intellectual property should not be allowed to do business with firms in America or, with our allies\u2019 cooperation, in Europe and Japan. The United States should also intervene to halt foreign investment in any technology that assists the Chinese Army or contributes to internal repression and limit the access to global markets of any Chinese company that is tied to human rights abuses and army modernization.\nTaking these actions would require an enormous amount of intelligence collection by American security agencies as well as crucial information from American companies. The latter is difficult to obtain: Out of fear of Chinese retribution, the foreign business community will cooperate only if there is a clear, bipartisan and long-term commitment by the American government.\nWhile the United States must act unilaterally if necessary, the cooperation of allies such as Japan, Germany and Britain would make these steps more effective. Such countries have their own interests in China. Imposing sanctions in the name of national security on the European Union and China, as the Trump administration has threatened, would unwisely give them common cause.\nPrevious efforts to assert America\u2019s influence against China, such as the discarded Trans-Pacific Partnership, did not push back effectively on Chinese economic aggression. Working with allies to directly address China\u2019s malfeasance would.\nAll this means putting China at the top of American international economic priorities and keeping it there for years, without overstating or overreacting to trade disputes with our allies.\nThe administration has demonstrated some good instincts on China, but it must not be distracted by the next round of Beijing\u2019s false economic promises. Protecting innovation from Chinese attack makes the United States stronger. Hindering the Chinese security apparatus makes external aggression and internal repression more costly for Beijing.\nChina is our only major trade partner that is also a strategic rival, and we should treat it differently from friendly countries with whom we have disputes. If Washington wants the global free market to work, it must intervene to blunt Beijing\u2019s belligerence.\nDerek Scissors (@DerekScissors1) is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, where Daniel Blumenthal (@DAlexBlumenthal) is the director of Asian studies.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/us-china-trade.html", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.81192"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.69129"}, {"label": "china-international relations-us", "score": "0.68546"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.67810"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.58939"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.54365"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.40259"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.18717"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.13896"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.12348"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.10284"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.05137"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.04489"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.04388"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.03642"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.03228"}, {"label": "foreign investments", "score": "0.02379"}, {"label": "most-favored-nation treatment", "score": "0.02376"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.02317"}, {"label": "military aircraft", "score": "0.02313"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02185"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02173"}, {"label": "united states economy", "score": "0.02083"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.01951"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.01882"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.01758"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01748"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.01736"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.01475"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.01472"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["China", "America", "China", "China", "China", "China", "Beijing", "Canada", "Beijing", "the United States", "China", "China", "China", "China", "The United States", "China", "America", "The United States", "China", "China", "China", "United States", "United States", "America", "Japan", "The United States", "the United States", "Japan", "Germany", "Britain", "China", "China", "America", "China", "China", "China", "China", "Beijing", "the United States", "Beijing", "China", "Washington", "Beijing"], "ORG": ["the American Enterprise Institute", "the People\u2019s Liberation Army", "the Communist Party", "the Chinese Army", "the Chinese Army", "the European Union", "Trans-Pacific Partnership", "the American Enterprise Institute", "@DAlexBlumenthal", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": ["Derek Scissors", "Scissors", "Blumenthal", "Trump", "Xi Jinping", "Trump", "Hindering", "Derek Scissors", "Daniel Blumenthal"]}}, {"index": 63, "year": 2019, "title": "Did the Police Spy on Black Lives Matter Protesters?

The Answer May Soon Come Out\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe first time Vienna Rye noticed her cellphone acting up was at a 2014 protest march against the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The device shut down abruptly as she was filming, even though the battery was fully charged.\nShe and other activists who had similar experiences at subsequent Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 cellphones suddenly switching off or losing reception, messaging apps going haywire \u2014 began to suspect the police were monitoring their telephones with Stingrays, devices that mimic cell towers and intercept communications.\nMs. Vienna and two other activists filed a public records request for information about police surveillance of the Millions March, a local group affiliated with the Movement for Black Lives. The Police Department rejected the request with a blanket statement that it \u201ccould neither confirm nor deny\u201d whether the records existed, relying on what is known as the \u201cGlomar response,\u201d which is usually invoked only by defense or intelligence agencies in cases of national security. The activists sued the department with the help of the New York Civil Liberties Union.\nOn Monday, a state judge ruled the police had to acknowledge whether or not they had used devices to monitor or interfere with the protesters\u2019 cellphones, rejecting the Police Department\u2019s argument that releasing the information would compromise its counterterrorism and criminal investigations.\nJustice Arlene Bluth of State Supreme Court said that if the police are using the cell-site simulator technology on protesters then it is violating the law and \u201ccannot hide exposure of that fact through a Glomar response.\u201d\nThe Glomar response, she wrote, \u201ccontradicts the purpose of disclosure\u201d under the state Freedom of Information Law.\nThe department had successfully used the same legal tactic in 2017 to block two open-records requests for documents about its secret surveillance of people in Muslim neighborhoods. The state\u2019s highest court sided with the Police Department in that case, but said the Glomar response can be used only in a narrow category of cases involving counterterrorism investigations.\nThree years ago, the police acknowledged after a separate open-records lawsuit that it had used Stingray technology more than a thousand times between 2008 and 2015 to locate suspects in a wide range of crimes, from murder to calling 911 too many times.\nFor the past four decades, the Police Department\u2019s ability to spy on political organizations and protesters has been curtailed under a court settlement known as the Handschu Agreement, which is overseen by a federal judge. That settlement put limits on the investigation of political organizations, creating an oversight panel and requiring that the police have \u201cspecific information\u201d that a crime was in the works before investigating.\nBut the department has violated the Handschu guidelines at times while investigating left-wing political activists.\nIn court filings, the Police Department argued that disclosure of the department\u2019s methods of monitoring cellphones would compromise counterterrorism operations and place New Yorkers at risk. In a sworn affidavit, John J. Miller, the city\u2019s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said that releasing information about cellphone surveillance technology would help terrorists carry out an attack and \u201csuccessfully evade detection.\u201d\nThe department released a written statement on Monday stating that it would review the decision. It has 30 days to appeal.\n\u201cThe N.Y.P.D. uses the Glomar response exceedingly sparingly and only after careful consideration of the interests involved, including transparency, the need to protect the integrity of criminal investigations and public safety,\u201d the statement read.\nBobby Hodgson, a staff attorney at the civil liberties union who argued the case, said in an interview that Justice Bluth\u2019s ruling was a firm rejection of the Police Department\u2019s legal tactic.\n\u201cThis is the N.Y.P.D.\u2019s attempt to massively expand the scope of Glomar and the cases to which it applies,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to deny public access to basic information about how the department monitors protesters.\u201d\nThe department\u2019s sophisticated arsenal of surveillance technology extends beyond cellphone surveillance devices to license plate readers, facial recognition software and drones. Officials have kept the department\u2019s capabilities largely shrouded in secrecy, civil liberties advocates said.\nSome city lawmakers have begun to push back. This year, Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, a Bronx Democrat, said she plans to reintroduce a bill that would force the police to disclose their surveillance tools. A similar bill failed in 2017 after the Police Department and Mayor Bill de Blasio came out strongly against it.\nChristopher Dunn, the associate director of the civil liberties union, said the department\u2019s handling of the Black Lives Matter request demonstrated the need for outside oversight.\n\u201cThis ruling shows that the N.Y.P.D. cannot be trusted when it comes to disclosing technology that it\u2019s going to use against the public,\u201d Mr. Dunn said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why there has to be legislative reform.\u201d\nFollow Ali Winston on Twitter: @awinston", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/nyregion/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance.html", "tags": [{"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.40165"}, {"label": "cellular telephones", "score": "0.22139"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.22081"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.12203"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.07625"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.06133"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.06105"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.05400"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.05243"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.04779"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.04501"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.03477"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.03377"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.03354"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.03198"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.02878"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02627"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02398"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.02398"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.02152"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.02003"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.01939"}, {"label": "assaults", "score": "0.01938"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.01878"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.01815"}, {"label": "discrimination", "score": "0.01662"}, {"label": "violence", "score": "0.01655"}, {"label": "espionage", "score": "0.01520"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.01520"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.01454"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "Vienna", "Bronx"], "ORG": ["Vienna Rye", "the Movement for Black Lives", "The Police Department", "the New York Civil Liberties Union", "the Police Department\u2019s", "State Supreme Court", "Freedom of Information Law", "the Police Department", "the Police Department", "the Handschu Agreement", "the Police Department", "the civil liberties union", "the Police Department\u2019s", "the Police Department", "the civil liberties union"], "PERSON": ["Eric Garner", "Michael Brown", "Glomar", "Arlene Bluth", "Glomar", "Glomar", "Glomar", "Handschu", "John J.

So why did she?\nThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nSheikh Hasina has done marvels for Bangladesh over nearly 10 consecutive years as prime minister. Per-capita income in what was one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world has grown by nearly 150 percent, and the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty has dropped from 19 percent to about 9 percent. All the greater the pity that her achievements have been offset by a precipitous slide toward authoritarianism and an election in which Mrs. Hasina\u2019s party won 288 of the 300 contested seats in Parliament, a preposterous 96 percent rate of victory.\nIn the weeks and months before the Dec. 30 vote, local and international human rights organizations chronicled a relentless campaign of intimidation, ranging from violence and arrests of opposition candidates and protesters to surveillance and a draconian digital security law that includes prison terms for posting \u201caggressive or frightening\u201d content. At least 17 people died in campaign violence. A Human Rights Watch report described \u201ca climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens,\u201d without any interference by an intimidated judiciary or election commission.\nIn an interview with The Times in December, the prime minister appeared to share the delusion of autocrats everywhere that human rights concerns were peripheral to a developing country\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIf I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the opposition is saying, or civil society or your NGO\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with that. I know my country, and I know how to develop my country.\u201d\nNo one would question that Mrs. Hasina, who is 71, knows her country. Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the first president of Bangladesh. She was abroad when he was assassinated in 1975, and she returned in 1981 to take over the leadership of the Awami League, which she has held ever since. Her party and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by another powerful woman, Khaleda Zia, took turns in power until the last election, in 2014, which the opposition party boycotted to protest changes to electoral procedures, giving Mrs. Hasina an uncontested new term. Mrs. Zia was jailed for corruption last year, and Mrs. Hasina is back for another term at the head of what has effectively become a one-party state, ready to further tighten control.\nBut why? Why produce nonsensical election results when polls indicated that Mrs. Hasina would likely have won a fair election handily? Mrs. Hasina\u2019s every achievement will now be tainted by her authoritarian methods and repressive measures; her critics, driven into exile or underground, will become only more strident, and her foreign supporters more wary.\nThe State Department, noting that the United States is Bangladesh\u2019s largest foreign investor and largest single-country market, expressed concern about \u201ccredible reports of harassment, intimidation and violence\u201d during the campaign and urged the election commission to work with all sides to address them. The European Union similarly called on Bangladesh to investigate the violence and \u201csignificant obstacles\u201d that had \u201ctainted\u201d the campaign and the vote.\nGiven Mrs. Hasina\u2019s political and personal trajectory, she is unlikely to be moved by such admonitions. But it is incumbent on countries doing business with Bangladesh and cheering its rise from poverty to remind her and her allies at every turn that human rights are not an imposition of an alien culture, but a critical element of development and progress.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/editorials/bangladesh-election-sheikh-hasina.html", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.71913"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.60684"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.54807"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.14876"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.11204"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.11110"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.10944"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.10658"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.10643"}, {"label": "legislatures and parliaments", "score": "0.10330"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.08996"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.05858"}, {"label": "third world and developing countries", "score": "0.03552"}, {"label": "boards of directors", "score": "0.03441"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.03292"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.02791"}, {"label": "censorship", "score": "0.02394"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.02255"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.02221"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.02161"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.02069"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01802"}, {"label": "freedom of the press", "score": "0.01512"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01475"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.01435"}, {"label": "prisons and prisoners", "score": "0.01360"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.01333"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01193"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01172"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.01089"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Bangladesh", "Bangladesh", "Bangladesh", "the United States", "Bangladesh", "Bangladesh", "Bangladesh"], "ORG": ["Farcical Vote", "the Op-Ed", "Parliament", "The Times", "NGO", "the Awami League", "the Bangladesh Nationalist Party", "The State Department", "The European Union", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": ["Sheikh Hasina", "Sheikh Hasina", "Hasina", "Hasina", "Mujibur Rahman", "Khaleda Zia", "Hasina", "Zia", "Hasina", "Hasina", "Hasina", "Hasina"]}}, {"index": 65, "year": 2019, "title": "Pentagon Extends Troop Deployment at Mexican Border Through September", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/troops-border-wall.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nPentagon Extends Troop Deployment at Mexican Border Through September\nThe deployment of active-duty United States troops at the border with Mexico will most likely be extended through September, the Pentagon said Monday.\nThe Pentagon\u2019s border mission had previously been scheduled to end on Dec. 15, and the Defense Department later extended the deployment into January. Then came Monday\u2019s announcement.\nIn a rare use of military force first announced in October, the Trump administration sent about 5,900 active-duty troops to join up with Border Patrol agents and National Guard members, as a caravan of Central American migrants made its way toward the United States.\nThe move was viewed by many as unnecessary political fear-mongering as the midterm elections approached.

Litt, principal associate deputy attorney general, told a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Clinton administration instead is pursuing an \"intensive dialogue\" between industry and law enforcement to try and find a cooperative solution to the debate that has pitted the FBI and the National Security Agency against the high-tech industry and a long list of special interest groups concerned about free speech and privacy issues.\n\"We are all looking at this point not to impose mandatory legislation and will work cooperatively with industry to find whatever solutions are available,\" Litt said.\nAsked by Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, if he was representing the FBI position as well, Litt said, \"Yes, sir.\"\nIt was the first definitive indication that the White House has reined in, at least temporarily, a strong lobbying effort by the FBI's director, Louis B. Freeh, for legislation to establish a system requiring that the \"spare keys\" to all scrambled communications be filed with a third party so law enforcement, with the proper court authorization, can gain immediate access to encrypted data. Separately, the White House had backed a voluntary key recovery plan.\nBut Litt did emphasize repeatedly in his testimony that the shift represents the administration's and FBI's position \"at this time.\" That would likely change quickly if pro-encryption forces move forward with legislation in the House to ban any type of key recovery mandate.\nSenator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on the Constitution, said \"consistency has not been the hallmark of the administration in terms of this and that's fine.\"\nThe Encryption Debate:\nIs It About Privacy or Security?\n\"But while we're in this negotiating posture I would hope that they would maintain an openness to a variety of approaches because I'm certainly not going to agree to any approach until I can be assured both the free speech and privacy issues are protected.\"\nBarry Smith, an FBI supervisory agent who played a role in getting a mandatory key recovery bill passed by the House Intelligence Committee last year, said \"the objective of law enforcement is to have technical solutions to our concerns.\"\n\"If we can sit down with industry and reach a technical solution to law enforcement's public safety issues on a voluntary basis, we are happy to do that,\" he said.\nFreeh has insisted that without the technical ability to quickly recover encrypted communications, law enforcers in the digital age will be unable to catch or prosecute terrorists, drug dealers and child predators who are increasingly using uncrackable codes to hide their crimes.\nBut opponents of key recovery argue that requiring Americans to file spare keys to their encrypted messages is an unconstitutional violation of privacy and free speech rights. They compare it to having to keep a spare key to your house on file at the local police station, or to government installing surveillance cameras in homes with the promise that they won't turn them on unless it is necessary to investigate a crime.\n\"If you ever want to talk about the proverbial fishing expedition, this is it,\" said Richard Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and one of five witnesses from a new coalition fighting encryption controls, Americans for Computer Privacy.\nThe alliance announced two weeks ago that it will launch a multimillion dollar campaign to educate the public about the need for unregulated strong encryption. The same day it launched its campaign, Vice President Al Gore wrote to Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, to say the administration wanted to pursue a cooperative dialogue with industry rather than legislation.\nRelated Articles\nGore Letter Seems to Soften Stance on Encryption\n(March 5, 1998)\nEncryption Issue Threatens Silicon Valley Rapport With Clinton White House\n(February 27, 1998)\nLitt reiterated that call at the hearing.\n\"The Administration is not wedded to key recovery, or any single technological approach,\" he said. \"We are flexible, provided that the resulting solutions and arrangements preserve the nation's ability to protect the public safety and defend our national security.\"\nWayne Madsen with the Electronic Privacy Information Center said he was skeptical that the talk of a cooperative dialogue represented any real shift by the administration in the encryption debate.\n\"My feeling is it's still the same old policy wrapped up in different wrapping paper,\" Madsen said.\nRelated Sites\nFollowing are links to the external Web sites mentioned in this article.

It requires mandatory 15-year sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies or serious drug charges.\nFiguring out what qualifies as one of those earlier offenses is not always easy. Tuesday\u2019s decision considered a part of the law that defined violent felonies to include offenses involving the use or threat of physical force. The question in the case was whether minimal force, as in a purse snatching, is enough.\nIn analyzing whether given crimes qualify as violent felonies under the federal law, the Supreme Court does not look to what the defendant actually did. Rather, it considers whether the crime \u2014 in this case, robbery under Florida law \u2014 covers conduct that does not qualify as a violent felony.\nThe case involved Denard Stokeling, who pleaded guilty to possessing a gun after burglarizing the Tongue & Cheek restaurant in Miami Beach, where he worked. After he was identified based on surveillance video and witness statements, police found a gun in his backpack. He was prosecuted on federal gun charges.\nMr. Stokeling had three earlier convictions, and prosecutors invoked the sentencing law to argue he should serve a much longer prison term than the one the gun charge would ordinarily have warranted.\nMr. Stokeling objected, saying that one of his convictions, for robbery in Florida state court arising from a snatched necklace, did not amount to a violent felony. That meant, he said, that he should face only a maximum sentence of 10 years rather than a minimum sentence of 15 years.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, said Mr. Stokeling\u2019s robbery conviction counted as a violent felony for purposes of the federal law. The Florida law required proof the victim resisted, he wrote, and that was enough.\n\u201cThe force necessary to overcome a victim\u2019s physical resistance is inherently \u2018violent,\u2019\u201d Justice Thomas wrote.\n\u201cThis is true because robbery that must overpower a victim\u2019s will \u2014 even a feeble or weak-willed victim \u2014 necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote. \u201cThe altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself \u2018capable of causing physical pain or injury.\u2019 \u201d\nThe quoted phrase came from a 2010 decision, Johnson v. United States, that concluded that convictions under Florida\u2019s battery statute did not qualify as violent felonies for purposes of the federal sentencing law.\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, who generally votes with the court\u2019s liberal wing in closely divided cases, joined the majority opinion on Tuesday, as did Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying the majority opinion could not be reconciled with the 2010 decision or the reality of how little force is required to be convicted of robbery under the Florida law.\n\u201cA pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm\u201d qualifies, she wrote. \u201cA thief who grabs a bag from a victim\u2019s shoulder also commits Florida robbery, so long as the victim instinctively holds on to the bag\u2019s strap for a moment.\u201d\nJustice Sotomayor added that locking up such offenders for long periods does not advance public safety. \u201cUnder Florida law, \u2018robbers\u2019 can be glorified pickpockets, shoplifters and purse snatchers,\u201d she wrote.\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the dissent in the case, Stokeling v. United States, No. 17-5554, as did Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.\nHad the court ruled for Mr. Stokeling, Justice Thomas wrote, convictions under at least 31 state robbery laws would have become ineligible to serve as qualifying offenses under the federal sentencing law.\nJustice Sotomayor questioned the accuracy of that statement and said earlier decisions from the court had already substantially narrowed the scope of the sentencing law. \u201cThe majority, fearful for the camel, errs in blaming the most recent straw,\u201d she wrote.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/supreme-court-violent-felony-purse-snatching.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.64435"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.55557"}, {"label": "sentences (criminal)", "score": "0.31495"}, {"label": "robberies and thefts", "score": "0.19897"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.19437"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.17205"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.09423"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.07158"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.04015"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.02941"}, {"label": "firearms", "score": "0.02908"}, {"label": "capital punishment", "score": "0.02804"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02311"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01966"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01427"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01358"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01210"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.01198"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.01174"}, {"label": "search and seizure", "score": "0.01152"}, {"label": "courts", "score": "0.01122"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00875"}, {"label": "fines (penalties)", "score": "0.00875"}, {"label": "jewels and jewelry", "score": "0.00768"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.00737"}, {"label": "drugs (pharmaceuticals)", "score": "0.00611"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00575"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.00568"}, {"label": "automobiles", "score": "0.00554"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00514"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Florida", "Miami Beach", "Florida", "Florida", "United States", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "United States"], "ORG": ["Supreme Court Concludes", "the Supreme Court", "the Armed Career Criminal Act", "the Supreme Court", "the Tongue & Cheek"], "PERSON": ["Denard Stokeling", "Stokeling", "Stokeling", "Clarence Thomas", "Stokeling", "Thomas", "Thomas", "Johnson", "Stephen G.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nIn New York, prosecutors operate within a draconian system that gives them free rein to leave defendants in the dark about aspects of their cases for months or even years.\nIn cases big and small, state law authorizes prosecutors to withhold key evidence from defense lawyers and their clients until the eve or sometimes the day of trial. Prosecutors in New York do not have a legal obligation to turn over in a timely fashion all police reports, witness names, DNA evidence, surveillance footage or anything else from their investigative files.\nThough a 1963 Supreme Court decision found that prosecutors have a constitutional duty to turn over anything significant that may exonerate a defendant, that ruling has not been consistently enforced because prosecutors who flout the rule are rarely punished.\nAdvocates for defendants say this entrenched legal structure in New York puts a \u201cblindfold\u201d over the eyes of defense lawyers and their clients. And it runs up against Americans\u2019 basic understanding of how fairness is meant to work in the legal system.\nBy preventing access to even the simplest information about a pending case, prosecutors thumb their noses at the presumption of innocence that is owed to every person accused of a crime. They also run the risk of forcing the accused to make an impossible choice: Plead guilty with little to no information about their case or go to trial and risk an even harsher punishment.\nNew York\u2019s law means that cases take longer to resolve, leading to backlogs; that defense lawyers are unable to advise their clients about the charges against them, let alone guide them through an often life-altering process; and that wrongful convictions can occur, in both extreme and not-so-extreme cases.\nMost states, including the law-and-order bastion Texas as well as North Carolina and New Jersey, have changed their laws and procedures to allow open and early disclosure of evidence in criminal prosecutions, which has led to fairer outcomes and deterred prosecutorial abuse.\nNow New York has a chance to join the mainstream on this issue.\nBy repealing the outmoded statute that allows for 11th-hour evidence disclosure and passing legislation that would make access to this information automatic at or near the beginning of a criminal case, New York lawmakers could level the playing field for defendants and bring the state closer to its progressive ideals.\nProsecutors defend New York\u2019s current system not on its merits but with fearmongering, arguing that reforms will leave witnesses and victims at risk. Disclosing the identity of a person with direct knowledge of an incident under investigation, the thinking goes, would hamper the state\u2019s ability to protect him or her and to fight crime.\nBut there are sensible ways of dealing with witness safety concerns. The Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, which has for decades made its evidence files readily available, shows that reform is possible. Likewise, the states that have left the old model behind have seen no need to go back to it.\nIt\u2019s time for New York lawmakers to bring the rest of the state in line with this essential notion of justice.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/opinion/new-york-texas-criminal-justice.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.64982"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.27378"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.22663"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.21207"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.20125"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.18757"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.11323"}, {"label": "courts", "score": "0.09741"}, {"label": "legal profession", "score": "0.09391"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.06083"}, {"label": "jury system", "score": "0.05981"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.05137"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.05092"}, {"label": "freedom of the press", "score": "0.04220"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.03638"}, {"label": "police brutality and misconduct", "score": "0.03534"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.03343"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.03300"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.02876"}, {"label": "sex crimes", "score": "0.02303"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.02199"}, {"label": "tests and testing", "score": "0.02035"}, {"label": "suspensions, dismissals and resignations", "score": "0.02016"}, {"label": "trials", "score": "0.01825"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01795"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.01737"}, {"label": "frauds and swindling", "score": "0.01306"}, {"label": "search and seizure", "score": "0.01241"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01167"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.01155"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "Texas", "New York", "New York", "New York", "New York\u2019s", "Texas", "North Carolina", "New Jersey", "New York", "New York", "New York\u2019s", "Brooklyn", "New York"], "ORG": ["Progressive on Criminal Justice", "the Op-Ed", "Supreme Court", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": []}}, {"index": 69, "year": 2019, "title": "O.K., Google: How Much Money Have I Made for You Today?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/books/review-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nO.K., Google: How Much Money Have I Made for You Today?\nA friend of mine says that whenever he walks into someone\u2019s home he\u2019s tempted to yell out, \u201cHey, Alexa,\u201d or \u201cO.K., Google,\u201d and order 50 pizzas, just to see if there\u2019s a device listening in on whatever gossip he planned to dish out next.\nShoshana Zuboff would undoubtedly get the joke, but she probably wouldn\u2019t laugh. In \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d she warns against mistaking the soothing voice of a personal digital assistant for \u201canything other than the exploitation of your needs.\u201d The clich\u00e9 that \u201cif you\u2019re not paying for it, you\u2019re the product\u201d isn\u2019t alarming enough for her. She likens the big tech platforms to elephant poachers, and our personal data to ivory tusks. \u201cYou are not the product,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are the abandoned carcass.\u201d\nO.K., Zuboff, tell me more. It\u2019s a testament to how extraordinarily intelligent her book is that by the time I was compared to an elephant carcass, I resisted the urge to toss it across the room. Zuboff, a professor emerita of Harvard Business School and the author of \u201cIn the Age of the Smart Machine\u201d (1988), has a dramatic streak that could come off as simply grandiose if she didn\u2019t so painstakingly make her case. She says we\u2019re living through such \u201ca bold and unprecedented shift in capitalist methods\u201d that even as we encounter the occasional story about Facebook allowing its corporate clients to read users\u2019 private messages or the software in Google\u2019s Street View cars scraping unencrypted information from people\u2019s homes, the American public doesn\u2019t yet grasp the new dispensation in its entirety.\nSo many people take care to calibrate their privacy settings just so, sharing certain things with friends and keeping other things hidden, while their data still gets collected and shared among apps for possible monetization now or later. Google and Facebook might not call to mind the belching smoke stacks and child laborers of the Industrial Revolution, but Zuboff argues that they\u2019re run by people who have turned out to be just as ruthless and profit-seeking as any Gilded Age tycoon. Instead of mining the natural landscape, surveillance capitalists extract their raw material from human experience.\nThis business model emerged almost by accident. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, happened to keep a cache of data byproducts \u2014 spelling, click patterns, location \u2014 that were produced with each search. It was only after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 that the company was forced to figure out how to do more than simply provide a free service to its users. It settled on selling advertising, but the advertising would be \u201crelevant\u201d and \u201ctargeted,\u201d using all the detailed behavioral information Google had collected from users.\n\u201cThis new market form declares that serving the genuine needs of people is less lucrative, and therefore less important, than selling predictions of their behavior,\u201d Zuboff writes. Whatever gauzy sentiments the new kinds of capitalists espouse (or even believe) about building community and democratizing knowledge get subordinated to the brute demands of economic survival \u2014 hence the relentless accumulation of additional data sources, and the ardent lobbying against government regulation.\nSurveillance capitalism has flourished precisely because it fulfills what Zuboff concedes are real needs and desires. Online platforms offer us ways to \u201cease the complexities of our harried lives.\u201d In exchange for surveillance we get convenience, efficiency and social connection.\nGoogle comes in for plenty of criticism from Zuboff, but she is equally scathing about Facebook. (She calls Sheryl Sandberg, who worked at Google before becoming Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, \u201cthe \u2018Typhoid Mary\u2019 of surveillance capitalism.\u201d) Facebook has learned how to manipulate empathy and attachment in order to increase engagement and make billions. In a document sent to advertisers in Australia and New Zealand, Facebook bragged of its ability to discern exactly when a young person could use a \u201cconfidence boost.\u201d And then there are the Facebook scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin during the 2016 election, with their deployment of personality tests and viral memes; it\u2019s all fun and games until the host of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d becomes president.\nSurveillance capitalists like to depict themselves as more socially enlightened than their industrial predecessors, but in Zuboff\u2019s reckoning they ask for a lot while giving relatively little back. Their companies operate at \u201chyperscale\u201d: Despite their enormous market capitalization, Google and Facebook each employ far fewer workers than General Motors once did, even during the depths of the Great Depression. Citing the economic historian Karl Polanyi, Zuboff shows how postwar corporations were expected to offer some sort of communal reciprocity \u2014 hiring workers and hiking wages, sharing prosperity rather than hoarding it. The ascendancy of neoliberalism in the 1970s, she says, laid the groundwork for Silicon Valley to promote an extreme form of entrepreneurial capitalism, unencumbered by any substantive responsibility to the communities it purports to serve.\nZuboff can get overheated with her metaphors; an extended passage with tech executives as Spanish conquistadors and the rest of us as indigenous peoples is frankly ridiculous, even if I can understand how Zuboff thought the phrase \u201crivers of blood\u201d would get her urgency across. The system she minutely describes is scary enough (I now have a clearer picture of why the Pok\u00e9mon Go app, a real data gobbler, was offered for free) without dialing the volume up to 11.\nBut then maybe my reflexive discomfort only indicates that I\u2019ve become acclimated \u2014 or \u201chabituated,\u201d as Zuboff likes to say \u2014 to the world that surveillance capitalists have created. Absorbing Zuboff\u2019s methodical determination, the way she pieces together sundry examples into this comprehensive work of scholarship and synthesis, requires patience, but the rewards are considerable \u2014 a heightened sense of awareness, and a deeper appreciation of what\u2019s at stake. A business model that seeks growth by cataloging our \u201cevery move, emotion, utterance and desire\u201d is too radical to be taken for granted. As Zuboff repeatedly says near the end of the book, \u201cIt is not O.K.\u201d\nFollow Jennifer Szalai on Twitter: @jenszalai.\nThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power\nBy Shoshana Zuboff\n691 pages.

The outline of the interference effort has always been easy to make out, but key questions about its significance \u2014 Could Russia really affect voter sentiment by posting? Did trolls really lower voter turnout in key states? \u2014 are still, in large part, matters for speculation. And the committee\u2019s findings did little to change that.\nOn the subject of Facebook, for example, the reports analyzed new internal data on the campaign efforts of the Internet Research Agency, Russia\u2019s \u201ctroll farm,\u201d and offered some examples of its work. We know that there were more than 76 million \u201cengagements\u201d with content from the Russian group \u2014 likes, comments, shares and clicks \u2014 but it is not currently possible to know how many came from real people. \u201cSince Facebook did not provide data about any sock-puppet accounts involved in the distribution of the content or the existence of \u2018fake Likes\u2019 from these accounts,\u201d one report says, \u201cwe are operating under the assumption that this engagement was from real people and that this content was pushed into the News Feeds of their Friends as well.\u201d\nThose are two enormous leaps. We do not currently know for sure whether these engagements were carried out by humans or bots or a mixture of the two, so the researchers were left to assume the worst. It\u2019s worth scanning other recent Facebook narratives for similar assumptions. Did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes protests in France? Is the movement \u201ca beast born almost entirely from Facebook,\u201d as a recent BuzzFeed piece suggested? Or are the protesters just using Facebook as they sustain a long tradition of civil unrest in France?\nThe latter theory is obscured by the basic difficulty of discerning why an individual feels a certain way, much less a diverse nation of millions. The former, however, feels as though it has been hidden from us, because Facebook should, in theory, be able to shed light on this question. Its users live in a state of full surveillance, with them and everything around them subject to near-total tracking. The company is at least capable of knowing how a piece of content found its way from one user to thousands or how a gilets jaunes group functions on the social platform. Far more than any outside researchers, Facebook is capable of answering questions about the Internet Research Agency in 2016: For example, how many of the accounts that interacted with the group\u2019s posts went on to interact with other political content? Was the audience for these posts even real in the first place or part of the operation itself? (Both reports criticized tech companies for doing the bare minimum to assist in the committee\u2019s efforts.)\nThe biggest internet platforms are businesses built on asymmetric information. They know far more about their advertising, labor and commerce marketplaces than do any of the parties participating in them. We can guess, but can\u2019t know, why we were shown a friend\u2019s Facebook post about a divorce, instead of another\u2019s about a child\u2019s birth. We can theorize, but won\u2019t be told, why YouTube thinks we want to see a right-wing polemic about Islam in Europe after watching a video about travel destinations in France. Everything that takes place within the platform kingdoms is enabled by systems we\u2019re told must be kept private in order to function. We\u2019re living in worlds governed by trade secrets.

Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful.\u201d\nThere are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2019\nThis is misleading.\nWhile governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls, about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon, said Elisabeth Vallet, a researcher at the University of Quebec in Montreal who keeps a tally of such construction.\nSeventy walls is closer to the truth, she said.\nEurope has built about 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, of walls since 2015, Ms. Vallet said.\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet. Some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on Fox Business that examined the issue the night before.\nDefining \u2018wall\u2019\nWhat Mr. Trump may think of as a \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d whether made of concrete or steel slats, would not fit the definition in Europe. Most of the walls he referred to on the Continent are, in fact, different styles of fences with masonry foundations.\nAnd not all of them were designed with migration in mind.\nCountries like Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the Middle East via the Balkan Route.\nBut Ukraine and the Baltic States that share borders with Russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor.\n\u201cAlmost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out,\u201d Ms. Vallet said.\n\u2018Fortress Europe\u2019\nMuch like the desert terrain along the United States border with Mexico, the perilous seas, not walls, have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to Europe.\nThe Continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants. Frontex, the European Union\u2019s border agency, and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as Fortress Europe.\nIt includes naval patrols and surveillance on the Mediterranean, where most migrants try to cross into Europe. European governments work with countries like Libya, Morocco and Turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings.\nLast year, an estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the European Union, according to Frontex. (The same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations.) This was 25 percent less than in 2017, and the lowest level in five years.\nStill, far-right politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis, accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric, to justify funds for border protection.\n[Read more about whether Europe is still facing a migration crisis.]\nSuccess is relative\n\u201cThe boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons,\u201d according to a report released in May by the Transnational Institute, a research and advocacy institute.\nIn another report on border walls, researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the Mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the European continent.\nWalls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters, but not to deal with the problem of migration, Nick Buxton, a researcher with the institute, said by phone.\n\u201cYou can build more and more walls until you\u2019re a completely walled society, but all you\u2019re doing is making it more and more dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will find ways to cross walls.\u201d\nThe fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to Britain from Continental Europe has failed to deter illegal crossings. Last year, about 500 migrants, 10 times as many as in 2017, attempted to cross the perilous waters of the English Channel from France. More than half completed the journey.\nReports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem.\n\u201cEvery time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem, it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table,\u201d Ms. Vallet said.\nMs. Vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work.\nShe noted that both the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line in France \u2014 each built at great expense \u2014 ultimately failed to stop invaders.\nPalko Karasz is a digital editor, based in London.

It is about defending the world order.\nMs. von der Leyen is the German defense minister.\nBERLIN \u2014 In April, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will celebrate its 70th birthday. Founded in the earliest years of the Cold War, it is just as relevant today, when many feel that the international order is shaken again. In fact, if NATO did not exist, those in favor of a free world would have to invent it.\nWhile NATO\u2019s key purpose remains to guarantee the security of its members, it has never been a purely military alliance. It is a political alliance as well, based on the common aspirations of its members who, as the NATO Treaty says, \u201care determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of its peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.\u201d\nThese principles are under assault today. Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, the terrorism of the Islamic State spreading from the Middle East to the capitals of Europe, authoritarian regimes developing nuclear weapons \u2014 as different as these challenges are, they have one thread in common: They emanate from actors who oppose the international order. They try to undermine or even change the rules that have governed the age of democracy and prosperity since World War II.\nThe democracies of NATO need to stand together to overcome these challenges. Collectively, we are stronger than even the mightiest of us would be on her own. Accordingly, since 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO has adapted to the situation at hand \u2014 as it has done many times in its history. Among 29 sovereign states with different political cultures and points of view, such adaptations will always be complicated, and sometimes even messy. But NATO\u2019s ability to change its priorities and its strategies ensures that the alliance will stand the test of time.\nThe results are tangible. For one thing, all European members of NATO have increased their military spending. The German defense budget, for example, today has increased by 36 percent compared to when I took office in late 2013. We still have more to do to fairly share the burden within the alliance, and we are prepared to do more. But we also keep in mind that burden-sharing is not only about cash, but also about capabilities and contributions. Germany is thus, as the second-largest troop contributor to NATO, proud to lead NATO\u2019s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force.\nNATO has also increased its presence in Eastern Europe, plays an active role in training Iraqi security forces and contributing surveillance to the fight against the Islamic State, continues to support the Afghan government, and develops its partnerships with like-minded nations such as Australia and Japan, in addition to much more.\nIn fulfilling its three core tasks \u2014 collective defense, crisis management and partnerships \u2014 NATO is an irreplaceable building block for an international order that favors freedom and peace.\nMost of all, NATO is not a trans-Atlantic organization in name only. It represents a special, even emotional bond between the American and the European continents. For a German, images of the fall of the Berlin Wall are inextricably linked with the alliance, and my country is particularly grateful for the security and the opportunities NATO has been providing for decades. So yes, in addition to the practical benefits of bases, structures and troops, NATO has a value in and of itself.\nMaybe the most basic benefit of NATO is that it provides reliability in an unreliable world. Our unshakable commitment to Article 5, the NATO treaty\u2019s collective defense provision, ensures that our common security is truly indivisible. We will help our weakest ally just as we have helped our strongest by invoking Article 5 \u2014 for the first and only time in NATO\u2019s history \u2014 after Sept. 11, 2001.\nSo it is a good thing that the European Union is now undertaking significant steps to enhance its military prowess. If members of the European Union succeed in harmonizing their defense planning and military procurement, and in intertwining their armed forces, then all of this will add to NATO\u2019s strength.\nAnd a stronger NATO will serve the security interests of all members. Most of all, it will send a clear signal to those opposing the rules-based international order: We trans-Atlantic allies are ready and willing to defend our soil, our people and our freedom.\nUrsula von der Leyen is the federal minister of defense of Germany.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/nato-european-union-america.html", "tags": [{"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.59310"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.46942"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.46253"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.20727"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.17876"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.13137"}, {"label": "independence movements and secession", "score": "0.12578"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.12227"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.08496"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.05945"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.04850"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.04610"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.03409"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.03109"}, {"label": "missiles and missile defense systems", "score": "0.02916"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02774"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.02733"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.02242"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.02120"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.01848"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.01658"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.01551"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01447"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.01315"}, {"label": "russia-international relations-us", "score": "0.01251"}, {"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.01240"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01121"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.01038"}, {"label": "arms control and limitation and disarmament", "score": "0.00992"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.00883"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["BERLIN", "Russia", "Ukraine", "Germany", "Australia", "Japan", "Germany"], "ORG": ["The World Still Needs", "NATO", "the North Atlantic Treaty Organization", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "Very High Readiness Joint Task Force", "NATO", "the Islamic State", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "NATO", "the European Union", "the European Union", "NATO", "NATO", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": ["von der Leyen", "Ursula von der Leyen"]}}, {"index": 73, "year": 2019, "title": "Wanted: The \u2018Traveling Bandit,\u2019 a Bank Robber Who Gets Around", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/traveling-bandit-robber-fbi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "Supported by\nWanted: The \u2018Traveling Bandit,\u2019 a Bank Robber Who Gets Around\nThe nicknames assigned by federal investigators to some bank robbers are drawn largely from their appearances or modus operandi.\nIn March, the F.B.I. said it was seeking a bank robber in California who used wigs and facial hair disguises, calling him the Shaggy Bandit.

The F.B.I. said he might be driving a white Ford Explorer or Expedition.\nJim Marshall, a spokesman at the F.B.I.\u2019s field office in Miami, said no one has been injured in the robberies. He did not respond to questions about how much money the robber has garnered.\nRobert J. Louden, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and homeland security at Georgian Court University in New Jersey, said on Friday that the robber was staying one step ahead of law enforcement by covering so much territory.\n\u201cPeople that repeat things get caught, but he\u2019s repeating things in such a way that each one is the first time,\u201d he said.\nWith his robberies spread out among multiple states, it is more difficult to draw attention to him because there is not one concentrated news media market, he said.\nRobert D. McCrie, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a security specialist since 1970, said it also meant that the local law enforcement agencies investigating were more diffuse.\nIt was unknown whether officials were able to retain the notes the robber displayed, but if investigators did, they would be useful in finding physical evidence, such as DNA or fingerprints, and to study its verbiage and handwriting, Professor Louden said.\nThe F.B.I. released seven photos of the robber, including one in which he was wearing a shirt that said \u201cStraight Outta Dallas.\u201d Given the intensive use of surveillance cameras in public streets, traffic lights, tollbooths and other public spaces, how has the Traveling Bandit eluded capture?\nProfessor McCrie said the answer was partly that the F.B.I. had not made bank robberies a priority for decades. Facing other demands, such as addressing espionage and other issues related to the Cold War, the bureau scaled back its focus on bank robberies starting in 1980, he said.\n\u201cRoutine bank robberies were not of significance,\u201d he said. Mr. Marshall of the F.B.I. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nStill, \u201ctakeover\u201d cases in which robbers vault over a counter and fire shots into a ceiling, terrorizing staff members and customers, will draw more law enforcement attention, Professor McCrie said. He added that investigations into bank robberies have a high closure rate \u2014 upward of 70 percent \u2014 compared with other crimes.\nBank robbers generally garner a small sum per heist \u2014 usually less than $3,000, he said \u2014 in what is considered a \u201crelatively safe\u201d crime. Tellers are trained to turn over money quickly in an effort to hasten the robber\u2019s exit.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no real weapon shown, the risk for sanctions is lower\u201d should the person be caught and prosecuted, he said, providing an example of an accused robber\u2019s defense: \u201cI never had a weapon. I may have acted tough, but the most dangerous thing I had was my Cross pencil.\u201d\nHe added that bank robbers are \u201cnot usually evil people\u201d compared with violent criminals. In prison, they are not regarded as \u201cheroes,\u201d but they are not at the bottom of the social strata either because they have credentials as courageous risk-takers, he said.\nAs for why the authorities nickname the robbers, Professor McCrie said it helps to cement an image in the minds of investigators and the public even if it feels faintly like it glorifies the criminals. Also, the F.B.I. has long had a history of naming its investigations.\nProfessor Louden speculated that the Traveling Bandit probably has a criminal record and that he might have a background as a courier or long-haul trucker.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll get him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible for somebody to stay out forever and not get caught.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/traveling-bandit-robber-fbi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "bank robberies", "score": "0.97504"}, {"label": "robberies and thefts", "score": "0.60676"}, {"label": "banks and banking", "score": "0.32980"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.13687"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.11476"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.07892"}, {"label": "embezzlement", "score": "0.02792"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.02436"}, {"label": "frauds and swindling", "score": "0.02331"}, {"label": "hair", "score": "0.01980"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.01793"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01764"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01476"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.01370"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.01249"}, {"label": "prices (fares, fees and rates)", "score": "0.01247"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01206"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01039"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00983"}, {"label": "culture", "score": "0.00970"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.00966"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00939"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.00818"}, {"label": "credit", "score": "0.00805"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.00755"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00724"}, {"label": "rewards", "score": "0.00703"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.00597"}, {"label": "history", "score": "0.00593"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00539"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["California", "Massachusetts", "Knoxville", "Tenn.", "Aventura", "Fla.", "Miami", "North Carolina", "Tennessee", "Alabama", "Illinois", "Price", "Utah", "Miami", "New Jersey", "Dallas"], "ORG": ["F.B.I.", "Capital Bank", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "Ford", "F.B.I.", "Georgian Court University", "John Jay College of Criminal Justice", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "F.B.I.", "Cross", "F.B.I."], "PERSON": ["the Shaggy Bandit", "Jim Marshall", "Robert J.

Libya is the principal springboard for most African migrants seeking to enter Europe, and before they even set to sea, the migrants face other dangers like traffickers and violence.\nThe dinghy set out on Thursday from the coastal town of Garabulli, Libya, west of Tripoli, and in about 10 hours started deflating and taking on water, survivors told humanitarian workers.\nWhen an aircraft from the Italian Navy on a security and surveillance mission spotted the craft 50 nautical miles northeast of the Libyan capital, the vessel had already started sinking, the Navy said in a statement, and roughly 20 people could be seen on board.\nThe rescue effort comes in a fraught political environment, with several European governments questioning the motives and behavior of independent rescue groups, and some bringing criminal charges against them.\nThe Italian Navy said that, after launching two inflatable rafts toward the migrants, it immediately called another helicopter to provide support, as their closest vessel was well beyond 110 nautical miles from the shipwreck.\nThe helicopter rescued the only three survivors and brought them to the hospital on the island of Lampedusa. They were suffering from hypothermia, had burn scars and were traumatized, humanitarian workers said.\nThe Italian Coast Guard said in a statement that it had \u201cimmediately verified that the Libyan Coast Guard was aware of the event within their search and rescue area, ensuring the outmost collaboration.\u201d\nIt also confirmed that a nongovernmental organization, Sea Watch, had offered its help and that the message was passed on to the Libyan Coast Guard.\nIn a separate incident,Sea Watch said that it had rescued another 47 people on a rubber dinghy in the Mediterranean on Saturday. But it had yet to receive information on what port, if any, the group could be brought to. One of the group\u2019s boats was stranded at sea for weeks earlier this month after being denied entry to several European ports.\nIn February 2017, the bodies of 74 migrants were recovered from a beach near the town of Zawiya in western Libya. The bodies were believed to have come from a shipwrecked inflatable raft that was found on the shore.\nEuropean countries have struggled to stem the flow of migrants, training the Libyan Coast Guard and offering money and other resources to Libyan officials to shift the migration crisis off its shores and to deal with it at the source. But the migrants keep making the perilous journey.\nOn Friday night, the Italian Navy said the rescue operations, coordinated by the Libyan Rescue Coordination Center, had concluded after the search for the dinghy proved fruitless.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/world/africa/migrants-died-sea-wreck-libya.html", "tags": [{"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.58713"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.11058"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.09410"}, {"label": "illegal aliens", "score": "0.09078"}, {"label": "rescues", "score": "0.07314"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.06777"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.05713"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.05697"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.03344"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.02785"}, {"label": "refugees and expatriates", "score": "0.02489"}, {"label": "ships and shipping", "score": "0.02050"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.01930"}, {"label": "women", "score": "0.01853"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01518"}, {"label": "smuggling", "score": "0.01288"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01274"}, {"label": "culture", "score": "0.01225"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.01126"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.01109"}, {"label": "fires and firemen", "score": "0.01076"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01021"}, {"label": "asylum (political)", "score": "0.00992"}, {"label": "fishing, commercial", "score": "0.00929"}, {"label": "boats and boating", "score": "0.00899"}, {"label": "animals", "score": "0.00893"}, {"label": "minorities (ethnic, racial, religious)", "score": "0.00800"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.00782"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.00766"}, {"label": "minorities (us)", "score": "0.00755"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["ROME", "Lampedusa", "West Africa", "Sudan", "Libya", "Garabulli", "Libya", "Tripoli", "Zawiya", "Libya"], "ORG": ["the Italian Navy", "the International Organization for Migration", "the Italian Navy", "Navy", "The Italian Navy", "The Italian Coast Guard", "the Libyan Coast Guard", "Sea Watch", "the Libyan Coast Guard", "Sea Watch", "the Libyan Coast Guard", "the Italian Navy", "the Libyan Rescue Coordination Center"], "PERSON": ["Flavio Di Giacomo"]}}, {"index": 75, "year": 2019, "title": "Are \u201810-Year Challenge\u2019 Photos a Boon to Facebook\u2019s Facial Recognition Technology?", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/technology/facebook-ten-year-challenge.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nAre \u201810-Year Challenge\u2019 Photos a Boon to Facebook\u2019s Facial Recognition Technology?\nThe #10YearChallenge was all fun and memes until last week, when a tweet moved thousands of people to worry: Are we unknowingly helping giant corporations to improve their algorithms for biometric identification and age progression?\nThe #10YearChallenge gained widespread traction on social media this month. It calls for posting two photos of yourself side by side \u2014 one from today and one from a decade ago \u2014 to show how you\u2019ve changed. People are participating mostly on Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.\nSome made jokes, paid tribute to old hairstyles or drew attention to issues like global warming. Celebrities posted glamour shots that showed negligible changes from one decade to the next. (The singer Mariah Carey won this round. \u201cI don\u2019t get this 10 year challenge,\u201d she wrote in a tweet, along with two identical photos side by side. \u201cTime is not something I acknowledge.\u201d)\nBut one post went viral without featuring any side-by-side photos at all. It was written by Kate O\u2019Neill, the author of the book \u201cTech Humanist: How You Can Make Technology Better for Business and Better for Humans.\u201d\n\u201cMe 10 years ago: probably would have played along with the profile picture aging meme going around on Facebook and Instagram,\u201d she wrote in a tweet last week. \u201cMe now: ponders how all this data could be mined to train facial recognition algorithms on age progression and age recognition.\u201d\nHer words hit a nerve.\nPeople responded with concerns about whether they were helping the tech giant get better at identifying people. Ms. O\u2019Neill\u2019s post got more than 10,000 retweets and more than 20,000 likes. She expanded on her thoughts in a widely shared article in Wired.\n\u201cI wondered about why this particular thought, in this particular moment, generated so much traction,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said on Friday, adding that she was not trying to stoke any panic.\nExperts said the photos uploaded for the #10YearChallenge were drops in a very, very big bucket of data that Facebook has been collecting for years.\n\u201cWe have an awful lot of data that we\u2019re sharing all the time, and companies are collecting it and using it in various ways,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said.\nSupporters of facial recognition technologies said they can be indispensable for catching criminals or finding missing people. But critics warned that they can enable mass surveillance or have unintended effects that we can\u2019t yet fully fathom.\nLauren A. Rhue, an assistant professor of information systems and analytics at the Wake Forest School of Business, said the #10YearChallenge could conceivably provide a relatively clean data set for a company that wanted to work on age-progression technology.\nBut she added that Facebook already has billions of photographs on its platform, and people should be wary of any company being in possession of such a large trove of biometric data.\n\u201cThe risk in giving up any type of biometric data to a company is that there\u2019s not enough transparency, not only about how the data is currently being used, but also the future uses for it,\u201d she said, pointing to another form of biometric data, DNA, which is increasingly being used by law enforcement to track down suspects \u2014 something many people might not have anticipated when they volunteered saliva in exchange for help tracing their ancestral roots.\n\u201cThere are things we don\u2019t think of as being threats,\u201d Professor Rhue said. \u201cAnd then five or 10 years from now, we realize that there is a threat, but the data has already been given.\u201d\nLike the rest of us, Facebook looked different 10 years ago. In 2009, the \u201cLike\u201d button was introduced, and the site unveiled a new home page to make it easier for people to see their friends\u2019 posts in real time. Facebook also reached 360 million active users in 2009; now, it has more than 2 billion.\nFacebook announced that it was using facial recognition technology in 2010. When people upload photos of their friends, Facebook can use the technology to suggest the names of people in the picture. It can also alert users if they are in a photo posted by a friend.\nFacebook has responded to concerns about photos and privacy in the past. The company said it does not intend to help strangers identify you, and has repeatedly pointed out that users can disable face recognition in their personal settings.\nAs for the 10-year challenge, Facebook said it\u2019s just a fun trend.\n\u201cThe 10-year challenge is a user-generated meme that started on its own, without our involvement,\u201d the company said on Twitter.\nSimilar memes have popped up in past years, too. But this time, users are grappling with new concerns about a platform that helps people to stay in touch with grandparents but has also been used as a tool of Russian interference.\nThe company faced several crises in 2018. In March, it was revealed that a political consulting firm linked to President Trump had improperly obtained data on as many as 87 million Facebook users. The New York Times reported in November that company leaders had tried to play down major concerns about privacy or deflect blame, and in December that Facebook gave big technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it had previously disclosed.\n\u201cThe threat to privacy has become real to people in the last year,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, the director of surveillance litigation for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cMy hope is that people will become concerned about this vast face recognition database that Facebook has amassed and push back on Facebook, turn off face recognition in our Facebook profiles, and push for strict privacy laws at the state and federal levels.\u201d\nMs. O\u2019Neill said she was glad that the meme \u2014 and her tweet \u2014 started such a broad conversation about facial recognition and privacy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunities for technology to do wonderful things for humanity,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think we need to recognize the potential downsides of it.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/technology/facebook-ten-year-challenge.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.82292"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.12120"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.07951"}, {"label": "blogs and blogging (internet)", "score": "0.07548"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.04221"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.04104"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.03884"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.03770"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.03091"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.02830"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.02614"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.01645"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01444"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01228"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.01173"}, {"label": "rock music", "score": "0.01163"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01145"}, {"label": "diseases and conditions", "score": "0.01123"}, {"label": "identification devices", "score": "0.01040"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00985"}, {"label": "frauds and swindling", "score": "0.00983"}, {"label": "book trade", "score": "0.00947"}, {"label": "advertising", "score": "0.00934"}, {"label": "science and technology", "score": "0.00884"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00845"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00843"}, {"label": "privacy", "score": "0.00832"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.00831"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00822"}, {"label": "women", "score": "0.00789"}], "NER": {"GPE": [], "ORG": ["Facebook", "Facial Recognition Technology", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Facebook", "Time", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Facebook", "the Wake Forest School of Business", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Twitter", "Facebook", "The New York Times", "Facebook", "the Electronic Frontier Foundation", "Facebook", "Facebook", "Facebook"], "PERSON": ["Mariah Carey", "Kate O\u2019Neill", "O\u2019Neill", "O\u2019Neill", "O\u2019Neill", "Lauren A.

Policymakers Are Trying to Figure That Out\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 Hal Abelson, a renowned computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was working the classroom, coffee cup in hand, pacing back and forth. The subject was artificial intelligence, and his students last week were mainly senior policymakers from countries in the 36-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nMr. Abelson began with a brisk history of machine learning, starting in the 1950s. Next came a description of how the technology works, a hands-on project using computer-vision models and then case studies. The goal was to give the policymakers from countries like France, Japan and Sweden a sense of the technology\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the crucial role of human choices.\n\u201cThese machines do what they do because they are trained,\u201d Mr. Abelson said.\nThe class was part of a three-day gathering at M.I.T., including expert panels, debate and discussion, as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development seeks to agree on recommendations for artificial intelligence policy by this summer.\nBut where are policymakers supposed to even start? Artificial intelligence seems to be everywhere, much hyped, much feared yet little understood. Some proclaim A.I. will be an elixir of prosperity, while others warn it will be a job killer, even an existential threat to humanity.\nThe organization\u2019s declarations, when they come, will not carry the force of law. But its recommendations have a track record of setting standards in many countries, including guidelines, going back to 1980, that called on nations to enact legislation to protect privacy and defined personal data as any information that can be used to identify an individual.\nThe recommendations carry weight because the organization\u2019s mission is to foster responsible economic development, balancing innovation and social protections.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get out in front and help create some sort of policy coherence,\u201d said Andrew Wyckoff, the group\u2019s director for science, technology and innovation.\nHere are a few themes that emerged at the gathering \u2014 ideas that could help shape the debate for years to come.\nRules are needed to make the world safe for A.I. \u2014 and let A.I. flourish.\nRegulation is coming. That\u2019s a good thing. Rules of competition and behavior are the foundation of healthy, growing markets.\nThat was the consensus of the policymakers at M.I.T. But they also agreed that artificial intelligence raises some fresh policy challenges.\nToday\u2019s machine-learning systems are so complex, digesting so much data, that explaining how they make decisions may be impossible. So do you just test for results? Do you put self-driving cars through a driver\u2019s test? If an A.I. system predicts breast cancer better than humans on average, do you just go with the machine? Probably.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear \u2014 you have to use it,\u201d said Regina Barzilay, an M.I.T. computer scientist and a breast cancer survivor.\nBut handing off a growing array of decisions is uncomfortable terrain. Practical rules that reassure the public are the only path toward A.I. adoption.\n\u201cIf you want people to trust this stuff, government has to play a role,\u201d said Daniel Weitzner, a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was a policy adviser in the Obama administration.\nEveryone, not just the superpowers, wants to shape A.I. policy.\nNew regulation is often equated with slower growth. But the policymakers at the event said they did not want to stop the A.I. train. Instead, they said, they want their countries fully on board. Nations that have explicit A.I. strategies, like France and Canada, consider the technology an engine of growth, and seek to educate and recruit the next generation of researchers.\n\u201cMachine learning is the next truly disruptive technology,\u201d said Elissa Strome, who oversees A.I. strategy at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, a government-funded organization. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for machine learning in fields like energy, environment, transportation and health care.\u201d\nInternational cooperation, the attendees said, would help ensure that policymaking was not simply left by default to the A.I. superpowers: the United States, which is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and China, which is not.\n\u201cWe think there can be a new model for the development of artificial intelligence that differs from China or California,\u201d said Bertrand Pailh\u00e8s, the national coordinator for France\u2019s A.I. strategy.\nIn the view of Mr. Pailh\u00e8s and others, China is a government-controlled surveillance state. In the American model, coming from Silicon Valley in California, a handful of internet companies become big winners and society is treated as a data-generating resource to be strip mined.\n\u201cThe era of moving fast and breaking everything is coming to a close,\u201d said R. David Edelman, an adviser in the Obama administration and the director of the project on technology, policy and national security at M.I.T.\nIn Japan, artificial intelligence is being seized as a lever to spur dynamism in its stodgy, hierarchical corporate culture. Japan is investing heavily to encourage the development of A.I. technology with a particular emphasis on \u201cstart-ups, small companies and young people,\u201d said Osamu Sudoh, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a senior adviser to the Japanese government on A.I. strategy.\nA.I. policy is data policy.\nOne specific policy issue dominated all others: the collection, handling and use of data.\nFast computers and clever algorithms are important, but the recent explosion of digital data \u2014 from the web, smartphones, sensors, genomics and elsewhere \u2014 is the oxygen of modern A.I.\n\u201cAccess to data is going to be the most important thing\u201d for advancing science, said Antonio Torralba, director of the M.I.T. Quest for Intelligence project. So much data is held privately that without rules on privacy and liability, data will not be shared and advances in fields like health care will by stymied.\nArtificial intelligence can magnify the danger of data-driven injustice.

But its impact could be global: If Apple were to build a so-called back door for iPhones sold in Australia, the authorities in other countries, including the United States, could force the company to use that same tool to assist their investigations.\nThe Australian law went into effect last month. It is one of the most assertive efforts by lawmakers to rein in tech companies, which have argued for decades that unbreakable encryption is an imperative part of protecting the private communications of their customers.\nIn recent years, law enforcement officials have complained that tough encryption has made it impossible for them to gain access to the online discussions of crime suspects, particularly in time-sensitive terror investigations.\nThe tension between tech and law enforcement came to a head about four years ago when Apple resisted a federal request to help investigators gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a man who took part in a shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually found a way around the iPhone\u2019s security without Apple\u2019s help. But if Apple had already created a workaround \u2014 a back door, in industry terms \u2014 to sell phones in Australia, the American authorities could have simply ordered Apple to use the tool.\n\u201cThis may be an encryption back door for the U.S.,\u201d said Sharon Bradford Franklin, director of surveillance and cybersecurity policy for the New America think tank\u2019s Open Technology Institute. \u201cA back door to an encryption back door.\u201d\nThe Australian law has limited oversight mechanisms. A notice sent to a company must be \u201creasonable and proportionate,\u201d and the authorities must have a warrant to gain access to a phone or service. But the agency issuing the notice decides what is reasonable.\nThere is an appeals process if a company is asked to build a new interception capability. A firm can ask an independent assessment panel consisting of a technical expert and a former judicial officer to review the notice.\nThe law says the Australian authorities cannot ask a company to build universal decryption capabilities or introduce systemwide weaknesses. But security experts and tech companies like Apple said that did not reflect what they would have to do to comply with an order. It is impossible, for example, to create a workaround for one iPhone\u2019s encryption without potentially introducing something that could work for all of them, they said.\n\u201cAll of Australian technology is tarnished by it,\u201d said Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of the founders of Atlassian, a business software company that is among Australia\u2019s biggest tech companies.\nAustralia is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and it is not the only country in the alliance with a law like this. Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act in 2016. For British law enforcement to gain access to data, it must first ask a judicial approver.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the first,\u201d said Michelle Price, chief executive of the nonprofit Australian Cyber Security Growth Network. \u201cBut Australia\u2019s version has gone much further.\u201d\nApple officials called the law \u201cdangerously ambiguous\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d\n\u201cEncryption is simply math,\u201d Apple wrote in a statement submitted to the Australian Parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on Oct. 12. \u201cAny process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.\u201d\nBut politicians said the risk of encryption technology\u2019s being used by terrorists was too significant. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said in July, \u201cThe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\u201d\nTechnology companies in the United States have argued that they cannot be compelled to create tools for breaking the encryption in their products because computer code is a kind of free speech protected under the First Amendment. But building tools to satisfy the Australian authorities would essentially make that argument moot. Countries around the world could demand access to the tool.\nApple is hardly the only tech company that could feel the impact of the Australian law. Anyone with a website is considered a communications provider, subject to the law. Any company that \u201cprovides an electronic service that has one or more end-users in Australia\u201d is required to comply.\nA long list of companies meets that description, such as smartphone makers and Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.\n\u201cOnce WhatsApp, for example, builds a system at the behest of the Australians, everyone gets to use it,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, the senior information security counsel on the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s legal team, who has studied the new law.\nThe law allows government agencies like the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or the Australian Federal Police to compel tech companies to install software on a user\u2019s device to get around encryption. It can also compel the company not to alert the user.\n\u201cSo if WhatsApp gets one of these notices and does not comply, they\u2019re subject to asset seizure and even hypothetically having executives hauled into jail for contempt if they refuse to do so,\u201d Mr. Cardozo said.\nThere is confusion about other secrecy requirements of the law. For example, would it require employees who received requests to keep them secret from their employers? The Australian Department of Home Affairs, which coordinates strategy and leadership of the country\u2019s national security policy, says it would not. But security experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and at companies like the password manager 1Password say it is actually unclear.\nAustralia does not have a strong tech industry, but it is growing, with investors and start-ups and a few established companies. And in the tightknit tech community that does exist, the new law has been a gut punch.\n\u201cWe never thought it would pass,\u201d said Alan Jones, chief executive of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney. \u201cWe all just figured that Australia\u2019s political leaders would consider the expert advice that told them this was nuts.\u201d\nSarah Moran, the chief executive of Girl Geek Academy, which teaches young women to code, said she had planned to begin tech start-ups in Australia until the law passed.\n\u201cI was looking to found two tech companies, but why would you build tech here now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government understands how drastically it impacts not just the tech that\u2019s built here but also the enthusiasm and entrepreneurial investment that Australians will be willing to make.\u201d\nMs. Moran, who is based in Melbourne, said she was questioning even the program she currently runs. \u201cWhy would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there\u2019s not going to be any tech industry?\u201d she asked.\nCasey Ellis, 37, was raised in Sydney but lives in San Francisco, where he runs a cybersecurity firm called Bugcrowd. He has already heard about companies that have become wary of hiring Australian firms, he said.\n\u201cPeople are factoring it in as a risk when you\u2019re looking at hiring an Australian now,\u201d Mr. Ellis said. \u201cIt\u2019s causing a chilling effect around Australian companies.\u201d\nFollow Nellie Bowles on Twitter: @NellieBowles.\nPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.\nWant more Australia coverage and discussion?

Now He Approaches It With Caution.\nNick Confessore, an investigative reporter who has written about social media and data privacy, has changed his tech habits after what he has learned.\nHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nYou\u2019ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people\u2019s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?\nI\u2019m not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting on how tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can \u2014 which is not very well.\nMost of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as the advertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.\nI use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google\u2019s operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I\u2019ve turned off location tracking for almost all of the apps I use, and I\u2019ve tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.\nFor search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I\u2019m doing.\nDespite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable. (I\u2019m thinking of going back to Firefox.)\nSo what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I\u2019ve turned off \u2014 or \u201cpaused\u201d \u2014 all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users\u2019 browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I\u2019ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.\nFor all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I\u2019m missing. And that\u2019s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.\nHave you changed your use of social media after writing about some of the data practices of Facebook?\nWhen I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google \u2014 and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.\nThat\u2019s partly because I don\u2019t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it\u2019s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don\u2019t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don\u2019t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.\nThe social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it\u2019s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in \u2014 once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife\u2019s phone \u2014 I\u2019m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.\nIs deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?\nNot in the slightest.\nIt may interfere with Facebook\u2019s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do.\nDeleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about \u201cshadow profiles\u201d \u2014 dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.\nWhat are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter?\nI don\u2019t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It\u2019s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection.\nWhen I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I\u2019ve also used tools at the National Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It\u2019s basically Google for \u201cdark money.\u201d\nMore recently, I\u2019ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you\u2019re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted \u2014 often information that is otherwise not public.\nThe most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.\nIf you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?\nI\u2019m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it\u2019s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way.\nThe privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I\u2019ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it\u2019s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.\nI\u2019ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer \u2014 and probably more stringent \u2014 laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.\nOutside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?\nWe\u2019re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don\u2019t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don\u2019t actually like.\nSonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can\u2019t I just play my songs directly from my phone\u2019s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)\nI\u2019ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter\u2019s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.\nI have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it\u2019s New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me.

If the block proves to be permanent, it would suggest that Western companies can do little to persuade China to give them access to what has become the world\u2019s largest internet market by users, especially at a time of increased trade and economic tensions with the United States.\nThe Redmond, Wash., company has cooperated with local companies to provide its Windows and cloud services to win acceptance by the Chinese government. Its long-established research and development center has turned out valuable products and launched the careers of a generation of artificial-intelligence experts who have started important new companies in China.\nBeijing has carried out several waves of increasingly intense crackdowns on internet freedoms as the Communist Party has cemented its control over more aspects of Chinese life. That includes cracking down on foreign internet products, including blocks on Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years.\nLately, the Chinese authorities have questioned or detained activists for posting on Twitter, even though the vast majority of people in China can\u2019t access the microblogging service. (The activists generally posted on Twitter via special software that can circumvent China\u2019s censors.)\nChinese officials disclose few specifics about their censorship practices, and Bing\u2019s status as of Thursday was not entirely clear. The Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a statement, Microsoft said, \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps.\u201d\nGreatfire.org, a group that tracks what sites are blocked in China, said the site appeared to be inaccessible in parts of the country but reachable in others. China\u2019s blockages often take time to spread nationwide, though in the past some services have been blocked in some places only to be restored later.\nWith Bing, Microsoft tried to play by China\u2019s rules. For example, a search for the Dalai Lama, the religious leader, would turn up state media accounts within China that accused him of stirring up hatred and separatism. Outside the country, it would point to sites like Wikipedia.\nOther searches, like for Tiananmen Square or the Falun Gong religious group, were similarly scrubbed, though over the years users reported that using coded language could help turn up posts about some topics that were generally controlled.\nBlocking Bing would brick over one of the last holes in a wall of online filters that has isolated China\u2019s internet from the rest of the world. Although not widely used in China, Bing has remained an option of last resort for some in China looking for an alternative to the dominant local search engine, Baidu. While it continues to dominate search traffic in China, Baidu has been at the center of complaints about poor search results and advertisements for questionable medical treatments.\nEarlier this week, a former journalist, Fang Kecheng, accused Baidu of largely returning search results that were links to its own products instead of those from external sites. The accusation, which Mr. Fang posted on social media with the headline \u201cBaidu the Search Engine is Dead,\u201d went viral in China.\nBaidu said in a statement that less than 10 percent of its search results included one specific Baidu product that Mr. Fang had singled out, and that its practices of using its own products in search results helped speed up download times.\nIn an interview, Mr. Fang said the Chinese internet was developing into a series of walled gardens, rather than the sprawling forum for ideas that makes online life appealing to many, thanks to censorship and to the rise of big Chinese internet companies like Tencent and Bytedance that dominate the online experience on mobile phones. Blocking Bing would only make it worse.\n\u201cBing compromised in order to have a Chinese version to get into the country,\u201d said Mr. Fang, a doctoral candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt would be pathetic if even this can\u2019t exist. We have one less alternative.\u201d\nChina has long been a difficult market for Microsoft. For years, it struggled to contend with widespread piracy of its Windows and Office software.\nIn July 2014, four of its offices in China were stormed by officials who questioned executives, copied contracts and records and downloaded data from the company\u2019s servers. What was described as an antitrust inquiry was spurred by Microsoft\u2019s decision to end support for older Windows software to encourage users to switch to newer versions that were more difficult to pirate, according to analysts. The withdrawal of support for a still widely used, if dated, version of Windows only underscored the country\u2019s reliance on foreign software.\nIn 2017, to ensure state support for Windows, the company partnered with a state-run firm to produce a government-approved version of its Windows 10 software. The firm, Chinese Electronics Technology Corporation, makes electronics for the Chinese military and is a major vendor of surveillance technology in Xinjiang, where the government has thrown hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, a local Muslim minority, into re-education camps.\nBeijing has insisted on closer scrutiny of software used by government agencies and companies since Edward Snowden, a former American government consultant, revealed that United States intelligence agencies used American technology for hacking purposes.\nDespite the difficulties, foreign companies still hold out hope for access to China, which with its size and its thriving mobile phone culture represents a potentially vast market. LinkedIn and Airbnb still have businesses there, though they take pains to comply with local laws. LinkedIn, which Microsoft bought in 2016, censors content in China, and Airbnb coordinates with local authorities to provide access about who is staying at its listings.\nBut trade tensions between China and the United States are only adding to the difficulties. Many American companies, along with Trump administration officials, accuse China of systematically forcing American companies to hand over their intellectual property to local partners or to government officials in the name of national security. So far, China has stopped short of boycotting American products, which could escalate the trade conflict and damage the Chinese economy.\nBaidu\u2019s falling reputation led to some support among China\u2019s intelligentsia for a re-entry by Google into the market with a censored search engine internally code-named Project Dragonfly. Its plans led to widespread criticism from Google\u2019s own employees. Some Chinese activists also protested, arguing a censored search would be tantamount to complicity with Chinese censorship. Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, has said it is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201d\nMr. Fang, the former journalist, said he had mixed feelings about a Google re-entry, noting that it would be good for Chinese who want a better search engine, but also that it would normalize censorship.\n\u201cI feel people in the West can say from their point of view that they are totally against Google coming back, as they have nothing to do with China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as someone who truly wishes that Chinese are able to get better-quality information, I can\u2019t 100 percent stand against it.\u201d\nPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai, and Karen Weise from Seattle.

I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.\nMichelle Goldberg\nI\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.\nDavid Leonhardt\nI\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.\nMy politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.\nHow do I listen?\nTune in on iTunes, Google Play, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever you listen to podcasts.

In this corner, all of us walking around with more computing power in our pockets than the entire federal government had at its disposal just a generation ago; in that corner, those rural or impoverished or underdeveloped communities doomed forever to live off the grid without Twitter.\nThat was before we learned that our technology is spying on us, manipulating us and eating us alive. These days, the off-the-gridders seem like the lucky ones. Book publishers have taken note, and our recommended titles this week include a substantial new argument against the intrusions of Big Tech (\u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d) as well as the fascinating account of a tribe of hunter-gatherers living on a remote Indonesian island (\u201cThe Last Whalers\u201d).\nOur fiction selections also consider the romance and the dangers of old-fashioned privacy, with a feminist dystopia about three sisters raised off the grid (\u201cThe Water Cure\u201d) and two novels about tumultuous emotions beneath placid surfaces (\u201cUnquiet\u201d and \u201cLate in the Day\u201d). We round things out with a memoir by a journalist who was imprisoned in Iran, the true story of a civil rights photographer who was also an F.B.I. informant, a history of the electric guitar, and a political study tracing the roots of right-wing populism. One sentence from that book brings things full circle: \u201cResearchers have shown that lies travel faster on Twitter than established facts.\u201d\nGregory Cowles\nSenior Editor, Books\nTHE LAST WHALERS: Three Years in the Far Pacific With a Courageous Tribe and a Vanishing Way of Life, by Doug Bock Clark. (Little, Brown. $30.) The journalist Doug Bock Clark, in order to write his first book, spent years with the Lamalerans, a tribe of 1,500 hunter-gatherers who live on a remote volcanic Indonesian island in the Savu Sea. The story Clark returned with is made up of births and deaths, terrible injuries and old rituals, furtive love affairs and intertribal rivalries. \u201cThe Last Whalers\u201d is an \u201cimmersive, densely reported and altogether remarkable\u201d book, our critic Dwight Garner writes. It has \u201cthe texture and coloring of a first-rate novel.\u201d\nTHE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, by Shoshana Zuboff. (PublicAffairs, $38.) This intensively researched, engaging book examines how tech behemoths like Facebook and Google gather personal data they can manipulate in unprecedented ways. Our critic Jennifer Szalai writes: \u201cAbsorbing Zuboff\u2019s methodical determination, the way she pieces together sundry examples into this comprehensive work of scholarship and synthesis, requires patience, but the rewards are considerable \u2014 a heightened sense of awareness, and a deeper appreciation of what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\nLATE IN THE DAY, by Tessa Hadley. (Harper/HarperCollins, $26.99.) In the British novelist\u2019s brilliant and upsetting latest work, the bonds of love and loyalty are frayed when a woman and her married friends confront the sudden death of her husband, forcing them to re-evaluate the terms of their friendships. \u201cHadley manages to be old-fashioned and modernist and brilliantly postmodern all at once,\u201d Rebecca Makkai writes in her review, \u201cunlocking age-old mysteries in ways both revelatory and inevitable. We\u2019ve seen this before, and we\u2019ve never seen this before, and it\u2019s spectacular.\u201d\nTHE WATER CURE, by Sophie Mackintosh. (Doubleday, $25.95.) In this sumptuous yet sparsely written debut, three sisters \u2014 living off the grid with their abusive parents \u2014 are taught to fear men. There is a distinctly cultlike element to the family dynamics: It is increasingly clear to the reader that these young women have been raised to fit their patriarch\u2019s ideal of what pure, fragile, privileged white womanhood should be. \u201cAt first glance \u2018The Water Cure\u2019 seems to be in conversation with Margaret Atwood\u2019s \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u2019 or 1970s feminist dystopias,\u201d N. K. Jemisin writes, reviewing it. \u201cYet the unspoken interstices of the story, to which Mackintosh delicately draws the reader\u2019s attention with haunting, oblique prose, emphasize just how much hogwash the parents are feeding their daughters.\u201d\nUNQUIET, by Linn Ullmann. Translated by Thilo Reinhard. (Norton, $25.95.) A novel that recaptures memories of the author\u2019s life with her parents, Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman, portraying a family that was splintered from the start. Our reviewer, A. O. Scott, identifies a \u201crueful humor \u2026 typical of Ullmann\u2019s prose, which is plain, succinct and declarative, with currents of intensity flowing beneath the placid surface. The effect, in Thilo Reinhard\u2019s graceful English translation, is almost Didionesque, as the willed, witty detachment of the narrator\u2019s voice at once conceals and emphasizes the rawness of her emotions.\u201d\nBLUFF CITY: The Secret Life of Photographer Ernest Withers, by Preston Lauterbach. (Norton, $27.95.) Lauterbach\u2019s vibrant study of Withers, a black photographer in Memphis who documented the civil rights era while also serving as an informant for the F.B.I., doubles as a love letter to Withers\u2019s hometown. Christopher Bonanos\u2019s review calls it \u201ca loose, rangy history of the civil rights movement in Memphis, using Withers and his camera as the (literal) lens. \u2026 Lauterbach is justifiably sympathetic to his subject, noting that one has to be generous about judging the things a black man in the Jim Crow South did to get by.\u201d\nTHE BIRTH OF LOUD: Leo Fender, Les Paul, and the Guitar-Pioneering Rivalry That Shaped Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll, by Ian S. Port. (Scribner, $28.) A scrupulously sourced, flashily written narrative about the (inevitable) coming of the electric guitar. No one person invented it, but Fender and Paul were crucial to its development. Muddy Waters, Jimi Hendrix et al. took it from there. Jon Pareles, reviewing the book, says that \u201cPort, a critic and guitarist who was the music editor for The San Francisco Weekly, has sorted out the facts of the electric guitar\u2019s much-mythologized genesis and cultural conquest. He turns them into a hot-rod joy ride through mid-20th-century American history.\u201d\nPRISONER: My 544 Days in an Iranian Prison \u2014 Solitary Confinement, a Sham Trial, High-Stakes Diplomacy, and the Extraordinary Efforts It Took to Get Me Out, by Jason Rezaian. (Anthony Bourdain/Ecco/HarperCollins, $29.99.) The former Tehran bureau chief for The Washington Post recalls his false arrest. \u201cPrisoner\u201d is \u201cmore than just a memoir that reads like a thriller,\u201d Michael J. Totten writes in his review. \u201cIt\u2019s also an intimate family history, an anguished love letter to an ancient and broken homeland, and a spirited defense of journalism and truth at a time when both are under attack almost everywhere.\u201d\nNERVOUS STATES: Democracy and the Decline of Reason, by William Davies. (Norton, $27.95.) This intellectual tour de force, which will be published next month, blends psychology, biology, economics, philosophy and religion to show how centuries of unreason gird today\u2019s right-wing populism. Mark Green reviews it with two other books on political topics, calling it an \u201cinterdisciplinary masterpiece\u201d that \u201curges rational leaders to better deploy \u2018imagery, sound and speech\u2019 to elevate reason over emotion, democracy over reaction.\u201d\nFollow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n1. The Senate failed to pass two competing proposals to reopen the government, sending lawmakers back to the drawing board for a bipartisan solution to end the impasse.\nThe Republican proposal included $5.7 billion in funding for President Trump\u2019s border wall, paired with legal protections for some immigrants. The Democratic proposal would have temporarily reopened the government until Feb. 8, but it omitted wall funding. A half dozen Republicans voted for it, but the tally still fell short of the 60 votes it needed to advance.\nLawmakers and aides in both parties expressed hope that the double-barreled losses would break the logjam that has gripped Washington since the partial shutdown began. House Democrats said they were considering giving Mr. Trump as much as $5.2 billion for border security \u2014 but not for a wall.\nNearly six weeks in, the shutdown is eroding the good will of highly skilled federal workers who chose public service over higher-paying private employment. And the Commerce Secretary suggested that instead of using services like food banks, federal workers should take out loans to stay afloat. Above, NASA workers protest in California.\n_____\n2. The leader of Venezuela\u2019s military declared his loyalty to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, above, and said the opposition\u2019s efforts to replace him amounted to an attempted coup.\nIt was a setback for the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, who proclaimed himself the country\u2019s rightful leader on Wednesday. In a further blow to the opposition, Russia warned the U.S. against meddling in Venezuela, a longtime Kremlin ally.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s legitimate president, and as did nations like Canada, Ecuador and Brazil. In response, Mr. Maduro cut ties with the U.S. and ordered American diplomats to leave.\nTaken together, the events escalated the confusion and conflict in Venezuela, an oil-rich and formerly prosperous country upended by political corruption and severe economic hardship under Mr. Maduro. Here\u2019s a primer on how the country got to this dire situation.\n_____\n3. The Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed Michael Cohen, a day after President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer pulled out of a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee.\nMr. Cohen will be called to formally correct false testimony that he delivered last year about a proposed Trump Organization project in Moscow. The Senate committee had been working with him and his lawyers to secure a voluntary return visit. But those talks were unproductive. Above, Mr. Cohen in August.\nMr. Cohen will have little choice but to comply with the Senate subpoena. But unlike the Oversight session, his return to the Intelligence Committee will almost certainly be behind closed doors.\n_____\n4. Satellite surveillance was once the domain of superpowers. Now, a growing number of start-ups are selling insights gleaned from small, relatively cheap satellites, known as \u201ccube satellites.\u201d\nTake the Chinese province of Guangdong, which stopped publishing a monthly health report on its manufacturing sector amid declining production in the trade war with the U.S. A small company in San Francisco used images captured by satellites to get that data, and now it\u2019s selling it to hedge funds, banks and other investors.\nSatellites already monitor everything from how busy retailers\u2019 parking lots are, above, to illegal mining activity \u2014 giving companies a new competitive advantage. And the niche seems set for further growth: Nearly 730 satellites were launched in the last decade, and another 2,220 are expected to follow in the next 10 years.\n_____\n5. The type of deadly Ebola virus responsible for recent epidemics has been found in a bat in West Africa, Liberian health officials announced.\nBats carrying the lethal disease have been found in Central Africa, and scientists have long suspected they were a natural host and a source of human infections in other areas, as well. Now they have proof.\nWhile the results are preliminary, the discovery could help researchers learn more about how the virus infects humans, and help public health officials educate the public about staying safe. Above, researchers sampling a bat.\nThe same strain found in the bat caused the current Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with more than 700 cases and more than 400 deaths. It\u2019s the second-largest outbreak ever.\n_____\n6. A hedge fund billionaire bought a New York City penthouse apartment for $238 million \u2014 the most ever paid for a home in the United States.\nThe head-turning sale comes amid intense debates about the wealth transforming the city. The property in question, above, is emblematic of that: A rent-regulated building was torn down to make way for the 79-story luxury condominium tower.\nKenneth Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel, purchased the nearly 24,000-square-foot unit. It\u2019s not his first trophy property, either \u2014 he\u2019s spent $750 million on homes around the world in recent years. Here\u2019s what else we know about Mr. Griffin.\n_____\n7. Now we turn to the pantry in our latest effort to help organize your life in the New Year.\nHaving a well-stocked pantry is a baseline for every cook, advanced or novice. And it\u2019s not just about having the spices you turn to most. Our definition of pantry encompasses refrigerator, freezer and cupboard, so you can make entire meals with staples you keep on hand.\nFor starters, take everything out of your pantry, keep what looks and smells good, assess what remains, and fill in the blanks with food that will make you a better cook.\n_____\n8. \u201cThe big thing is the sound. I\u2019m not really looking for how they cut.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the composer Julia Wolfe, who was in the market for scissors for her new musical work, \u201cFire in my mouth.\u201d\nThe orchestral and choral composition is about the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, mostly immigrant women. She won a Pulitzer Prize for an earlier work about Pennsylvania coal miners.\nMs. Wolfe wanted to suggest factories in the new composition. String parts recall sewing machines, and chorus members open and close scissors at various points. But first she needed to find the right snip, so we followed her around New York\u2019s garment district on her search.\n_____\n9. Mabel Stark had her first encounter with a tiger in 1911, when she sneaked into the grounds of a circus in California and found herself face to face with a mature Bengal named King.\nShe was hooked. Ms. Stark would go on to become the world\u2019s most celebrated tiger trainer, spending most of her life among the big cats at circuses and theme parks. She died in 1968 and never received a Times obituary, until now\n\u201cFor me,\u201d she wrote in her autobiography, \u201cthere is no greater thrill than stepping into a cageful of those glorious beasts and matching wits with them.\u201d\n_____\n10. Finally, we end with a sweet serenade.\nWhen a Massachusetts middle school choir teacher got engaged in 2016, he kept it quiet for months, not knowing how his students would react to him having a husband.\nBut word got out last year, and two school mothers organized a surprise celebration. After a month of secret rehearsals, 50 students performed \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d by the Beatles at the couple\u2019s rehearsal brunch \u2014 and a recording of the performance went viral.\n\u201cSome of the students singing have inner struggles,\u201d the choir teacher said. \u201cI was so glad they were there, feeling the love in the room and knowing everything\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d\nHave a lovely night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing.

The refugee was released from custody although the possibility of charges against him remain.\nThe youth who was charged was not identified, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police would not describe him. But the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the Canadian Press news agency identified his friend as Hussam Eddin Alzahabi, 20, one of about 52,000 Syrian refugees who have come to Canada.\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, who made the Syrians\u2019 resettlement a leading priority of his government, faced questions on Friday about Canada\u2019s openness toward refugees.\nWith the Syrians\u2019 arrival, Canadians swiftly embraced a program that allows individuals or groups to bring refugees to their country provided that the Canadians are willing to meet all of their needs for at least one year. While the program is a source of pride for many Canadians, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s opponents on the right have long raised concerns that it could leave the country vulnerable.\nThough little is known about the bomb plot case, it could fuel a right-wing backlash against refugees similar to that in Germany, which has also admitted large numbers of asylum seekers.\nConservative Party leaders hope to make Mr. Trudeau\u2019s immigration policies an issue in this year\u2019s parliamentary elections, and this episode may give them an opening.\nAlthough he did not mention Mr. Alzahabi by name or discuss his background, Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, said in a statement that the arrests made it \u201cclear that Canada\u2019s refugee screening process needs to be seriously examined.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recently learned of several examples of dangerous individuals entering the country due in part to lax screening procedures,\u201d Mr. Scheer said.\nRalph Goodale, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s public safety minister, dismissed the opposition leader\u2019s remarks.\n\u201cSomehow he already knows or is presuming the result of a police investigation,\u201d Mr. Goodale told reporters. \u201cLet\u2019s get the facts on the table and then we\u2019ll determine the appropriate course of action.\u201d\nEven by the Mounties\u2019 tight-lipped standards, remarkably few facts were released on Friday about the plot and the people the police said had originated it.\nAt a news conference, an official of the Mounties, Chief Superintendent Michael LeSage, said that the national police force had received a tip from the F.B.I. in late December that a terror plot was underway in Kingston. About 300 people and a special, low-flying surveillance airplane \u2014 which provoked curiosity and irritation among many people in the city \u2014 were brought in to aid in the investigation.\nSuperintendent Peter Lambertucci of the Mounties, who heads one of its counterterrorism units in Ottawa, said that while Mr. Alzahabi and his friend had developed an \u201cattack plan,\u201d they had no target or date. And while the police seized materials that could be components for a bomb, they said the two had not built one. The police would not answer questions about a possible motive or ideology fueling the plot.\nCanada\u2019s welcoming attitude toward refugees from Syria\u2019s civil war, which is approaching its eighth year, became a powerful symbol of its openness as a country.\nIn 2017, Mr. Trudeau famously wrote a tweet saying that Canada was ready to welcome \u201cthose fleeing persecution, terror & war.\u201d It came after President Trump moved to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries and seemed calculated to present liberal Canada\u2019s embrace of refugees as a counterpoint to the attitude of the Trump administration.\nA group of four churches in Kingston sponsored Mr. Alzahabi\u2019s family, said Alex Pierson, the executive director of the Anglican Diocese of Ontario. Citing privacy reasons, he declined to say when the family arrived, other than that it was more than a year ago.\nAn annual report for one of the churches indicates that Mr. Alzahabi arrived from Kuwait with his father, Amin Alzahabi, his mother and three siblings after their home in Damascus, Syria, was destroyed. Amin Alzahabi, the report said, had been jailed for political reasons and \u201cwould be vulnerable to arrest and \u2018extreme measures\u2019 should he and the family return home.\u201d\nA joint statement by the Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches said that they supported the police in the investigation and that \u201cour concerns, thoughts and prayers are for Kingston and the surrounding area, the faith communities involved, the family and all those affected by this unfortunate situation.\u201d\nAmin Alzahabi told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that his son liked Canada and the safety it brought the family, and he rejected the idea that his son was plotting an attack.\n\u201cI trust my son,\u201d he told the broadcaster, \u201cI know he cannot do anything against any human.\u201d\nA 2018 government report on terrorist threats to Canada said that the main one stemmed from individuals or groups inspired by the Islamic State or Al Qaeda. The country was also concerned with threats posed by right-wing extremists.\nSince October 2014, Canada\u2019s national terrorism threat level has remained at \u201cmedium,\u201d meaning that a violent act of terrorism could occur. Mr. Goodale, the public safety minister, said on Thursday that the latest arrests had not changed that designation.\nFollow Ian Austen and Dan Bilefsky on Twitter: @ianrausten and @DanBilefsky.\nIan Austen reported from Kingston, Ontario, and Dan Bilefsky from Montreal.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/world/canada/terror-plot-arrests-refugees.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.68008"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.35243"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.19385"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.16538"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.12116"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.03997"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.03974"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.02917"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.02739"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.02658"}, {"label": "refugees and expatriates", "score": "0.02594"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.02131"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.02057"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01796"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.01689"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.01351"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01239"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01198"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.01181"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01147"}, {"label": "deportation", "score": "0.01047"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.00945"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00901"}, {"label": "asylum (political)", "score": "0.00831"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.00801"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00759"}, {"label": "illegal aliens", "score": "0.00715"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.00681"}, {"label": "government information policies", "score": "0.00543"}, {"label": "hijacking", "score": "0.00523"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Canada", "Ontario", "Canada", "Canada", "Germany", "Canada", "Kingston", "Ottawa", "Canada", "Syria", "Canada", "Canada", "Kuwait", "Damascus", "Syria", "Canada", "Canada", "Canada", "Kingston", "Ontario", "Montreal"], "ORG": ["Refugee Embrace", "the Royal Canadian Mounted Police", "the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation", "Canadian Press", "Conservative Party", "F.B.I.", "Kingston", "the Anglican Diocese of Ontario", "Roman Catholic Churches", "Kingston", "the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation", "the Islamic State", "Al Qaeda"], "PERSON": ["Hussam Eddin Alzahabi", "Justin Trudeau", "Trudeau", "Trudeau", "Alzahabi", "Andrew Scheer", "Scheer", "Ralph Goodale", "Trudeau", "Goodale", "Michael LeSage", "Peter Lambertucci", "Alzahabi", "Trudeau", "Trump", "Trump", "Alzahabi", "Alex Pierson", "Alzahabi", "Amin Alzahabi", "Amin Alzahabi", "Amin Alzahabi", "Goodale", "Ian Austen", "Dan Bilefsky", "@DanBilefsky", "Ian Austen", "Dan Bilefsky"]}}, {"index": 85, "year": 2019, "title": "Trump\u2019s Speech to the Nation: Fact Checks and Background", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/trump-speech.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur", "text_content": "Supported by\nTrump\u2019s Speech to the Nation: Fact Checks and Background\nPresident Trump addressed the country on Tuesday, the 18th day of the government shutdown, about border security. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer delivered the Democratic response.\nHere\u2019s what the president said, and how it stacks up against the facts.\n\u201cThe federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.\u201d\nFalse.\nDemocrats have offered $1.3 billion in funding for border security measures like enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing. They do not support Mr. Trump\u2019s border wall.\nAt a meeting with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer in December, Mr. Trump took responsibility for the partial government shutdown.\n\u201cI will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it,\u201d he said.\n\u2014 Linda Qiu\n\u201cEvery day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country.\u201d\nThis is misleading.\nIn November, the agency, which is actually named Customs and Border Protection (and which oversees the Border Patrol), apprehended 51,856 people trying to cross the border illegally. That\u2019s about 1,700 per day.\nThe agency also deemed another 10,600 \u201cinadmissible,\u201d which refers to people who seek lawful entry into the United States but are barred from doing so. Together, that would be over 2,000, but \u201cinadmissible\u201d is not the same thing as illegal entry.\n\u2014 Linda Qiu\n\u201cSenator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with other Democrats.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nTwenty-six Senate Democrats \u2014 including Mr. Schumer \u2014 voted for a 2006 law that authorized about 700 miles of fencing along the southwest border. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump characterized the 2006 legislation as inadequate, dismissing it as \u201csuch a little wall, it was such a nothing wall.\u201d\nAs part of his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to build a 1,000-mile concrete border wall. He sometimes calls the wall a fence, though he has also rejected suggestions that it is a fence.\n\u2014 Linda Qiu\n\u201cAmerica proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nSome economists argue that immigrants drive down available jobs and wages for Americans only if they are competing for the same jobs as the domestic work force. In many cases, immigrants \u2014 legal or illegal \u2014 are seeking jobs that American citizens do not want to do.\nKevin Hassett, the White House\u2019s top economist, argued before joining the Trump administration that immigration spurs economic growth and that the United States should double its intake of immigrants.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\u201cEvery week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 percent of which floods across our southern border.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nMost heroin smuggled into the United States does come through the southwest border, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s latest National Drug Threat Assessment report. But most of it is smuggled into the United States through legal ports of entry at the southern border, not through the desert, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s 2018 annual drug threat assessment.\nA border wall would not address what experts see as the next, more deadly phase of the opioid epidemic: fentanyl.\nFentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis. It is also sometimes mixed with heroin.\nMost fentanyl enters the United States from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry, according to the report, and through Canada from China. A lower-potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico. The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity. The fentanyl sent through conventional mail packages has proved difficult for law enforcement to detect. Fentanyl coming from Mexico is often hidden in automobile compartments, much like conventional drug smuggling.\nThe president\u2019s opioids commission reported last November that \u201cwe are losing this fight predominately through China.\u201d\n\u2014 Michael Tackett\n\u201cIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nIn the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested over 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions, and another 55,233 people with pending criminal charges.\nBut it should be noted that these criminal convictions covered a range of offenses, including many that were nonviolent. The most common charges were for traffic violations, possessing or selling drugs and immigration offenses like illegal entry.\n\u2014 Linda Qiu\n\u201cThe wall will also be paid for, indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.\u201d\nFalse.\nFirst, the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, has yet to pass in Congress. Any economic benefits from the agreement, if it passes, will most likely come in the form of lower tariffs for American companies or higher wages for American workers.\nThis is different from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise that Mexico would finance the wall.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\u201cThe border wall would very quickly pay for itself.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nThe president has claimed that the annual cost of illegal drugs in the United States is $500 billion. But a 2015 report by the surgeon general estimated that the annual economic impact of illicit drug use is $193 billion.\nStopping the flow of drugs across the southwest border would not entirely stem the flow of drugs across the United States. Moreover, it is not clear how reducing the cost of drug addiction would finance the wall.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\nFact check: the Democratic response\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader:\n\u201cNo president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.\u201d\nThis needs context.\nAn estimated 800,000 federal workers are furloughed or working without pay because of the shutdown. While millions of Americans are not being directly harmed, there is a multiplier effect when considering family members of those whose jobs are affected. This also spills into the broader economy, harming business owners whose customers must cut back, tourism and travel.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\nReaction to President Trump\u2019s Speech\nRepublicans\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that he had never seen Mr. Trump behave in such a presidential manner. And he issued a dire warning to Mr. Trump\u2019s base.\n\u201cIf we undercut the president, that\u2019s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\n\u201cAs the president clearly laid out tonight, we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border,\u201d Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.\n\u201cI stand ready and willing to work with the White House and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate to find a legislative solution to border security and reopen the government.\u201d\nDemocrats\nEven before the speech began, Democrats were preparing their rebuttals.\n\u201cPresident Trump is going to use the public airwaves to spread fear and misinformation tonight,\u201d tweeted Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the head of the Democrats\u2019 messaging arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to correct the record.\u201d\nIn a more lighthearted jab, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, joked that he unsuccessfully tried to get Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, to \u201clivestream a Trump\u2019s Not Telling The Truth drinking game tonight.\u201d\n\u201cMe and him, shot of beer every time Trump says something made up,\u201d Mr. Murphy wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bite.\u201d (Mr. Schatz, live-tweeting the speech, noted instead: \u201cThis is dark.\u201d)\nAnd during the speech, Democrats flooded the internet with their own commentary, frequently reflecting Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric back at his administration.\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency is a national emergency!\u201d wrote Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota.\nBut it was perhaps Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat, who most succinctly summed up his party\u2019s response: \u201cWe are not paying a $5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall,\u201d he tweeted, with a castle emoji. \u201cAnd nothing you just said will change that cold, hard reality.\u201d\n\u2014 Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson\nImportant background and updates\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer delivered the Democratic response.\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, spoke from the Capitol after Mr. Trump finished his remarks from the Oval Office. The dueling speeches from opposite sides of Pennsylvania Avenue unfolded at the close of Day 18 of a government shutdown over Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall that Democrats have steadfastly opposed.\nThe Democratic leaders\u2019 decision to select themselves as the message-bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown, even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of Americans hang in the balance.\nSenator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, also made a public response to Mr. Trump, which was streamed live on social media platforms after Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer concluded their remarks.\nThe move was reminiscent of how a fractious Republican Party responded to State of the Union addresses when Barack Obama was president: Republican leaders designated a formal response and Tea Party-aligned conservatives chose their own messengers to deliver a different rebuttal.\n\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld Davis\n[Read more about the Democratic response.]\nSenate Democrats took the floor in protest.\nA dozen Senate Democrats took the floor this evening for a talkathon-style protest calling on Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans to end the government shutdown. Led by Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, it was yet another effort to raise the pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow a vote on legislation that would reopen the government.\nEarlier Tuesday, Senate Democrats voted against advancing a package of bipartisan Middle East policy bills slated for consideration this week to further press Republicans. Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor on Tuesday that he would \u201cnot waste time on show votes.\u201d But he is also being pushed by vulnerable members of his own party up for re-election in 2020 to intervene and end the shutdown.\n\u2014 Catie Edmondson\nThe decision by major broadcast networks to carry Mr. Trump\u2019s address live in prime time set off a fierce debate.\nWhat is normally an easy decision for network executives \u2014 granting airtime to a sitting president to address the nation \u2014 led to hours of hand-wringing by journalists and producers wary of giving a platform to a president whose public remarks, particularly on immigration, have been marked by untruths and misleading claims. Liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who, hours earlier, had used Twitter to label journalists \u201cthe Enemy of the People,\u201d \u201cthe real Opposition Party\u201d and \u201ccrazed lunatics.\u201d\nEventually, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox agreed to a request by Mr. Trump for the airtime, forgoing their 9 p.m. entertainment shows \u2014 and millions of dollars in associated ad revenue \u2014 for his Oval Office appearance, in which he plans to address the government shutdown. The networks said on Tuesday that they would also broadcast the Democratic response.\n\u2014 Michael M.

The government of President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel has offered Mr. Maduro its \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d and called Venezuela\u2019s political turmoil \u201cthe attempt to impose a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, a puppet government at the service of the United States.\u201d\nIn the view of many of Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents, however, Cuba is to blame in large part for the Venezuelan president\u2019s endurance in office. They point to the presence of Cuban operatives in the country \u2014 spies, intelligence and political advisers, counterintelligence agents, military trainers \u2014 and contend that they have propped up Mr. Maduro by helping to suppress dissent within the armed forces and throughout society.\nMar\u00eda Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, said in an interview that the presence of Cubans in the Venezuelan armed forces was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d The Cuban government, she insisted, \u201cmust understand that they have to let go of Venezuela.\u201d\nThe two nations started drawing close with the election of Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in 1998. The relationship was driven by a deep friendship between Mr. Ch\u00e1vez and his Cuban counterpart at the time, Fidel Castro.\n\u201cThey were very close, like a father-and-son relationship,\u201d said Richard Feinberg, professor at the University of California, San Diego, and a specialist on the Cuban economy.\nThe two leaders developed a close economic and political alliance. In addition to sending security and military specialists to Venezuela, Cuba sent experts from other professions \u2014 including doctors, nurses, teachers and athletic coaches \u2014 to beef up the South American nation\u2019s professional ranks.\nStill, some analysts say that while Cuba\u2019s support for the current Venezuelan government is important, it ultimately will not be decisive.\n\u201cThis claim that Cuba is controlling Venezuela has been around, really, since Ch\u00e1vez started,\u201d said David Smilde, a sociology professor and expert on Venezuela at Tulane University. \u201cIt\u2019s been long overblown.\u201d\nThe Cubans, he added, \u201care key consultants and advisers, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re calling the shots or telling them what to do.\u201d\nWhile former military officials who have fled Venezuela have reported the involvement of Cubans within the security and intelligence forces, experts say the extent of that involvement remains shrouded in mystery.\nIn testimony to the United States Senate in 2017, Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States and an outspoken critic of Mr. Maduro, asserted that there were about 15,000 Cubans in Venezuela and likened it to \u201can occupation army.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about this, and rumors about numbers and about how close they are to Maduro,\u201d said Ted Piccone, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen any hard, solid reporting on it.\u201d\nWhatever the extent of Cuba\u2019s support, Venezuela for years supplied heavily subsidized crude oil to the island nation, at a rate of about 100,000 barrels per day, experts said. Cuba would refine the surplus and resell it on the international market.\nAccording to a policy brief published by the Brookings Institution, by 2012 the trade in goods and services amounted to 20.8 percent of Cuba\u2019s gross domestic product.\nDuring the Venezuelan economic crisis of the past several years, however, crude exports to Cuba have dropped as Venezuelan oil production has collapsed. In 2017, the financial health of Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil company, Pdvsa, had declined so much that Cuba took the company\u2019s 49 percent share in a Cuban refinery as payment for outstanding debts.\nIn addition, the ranks of Cuban professionals working in the South American country have thinned in recent years, analysts say, and the relationship between Mr. Maduro and the current Cuban leadership is not nearly as warm as the friendship between their predecessors.\n\u201cThey are certainly ideological brothers-in-arms \u2014 against the United States and all that,\u201d Mr. Piccone said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have the same friendliness as it used to. And the Cubans aren\u2019t getting as much out of it as they used to.\u201d\nYet the alliance has been resilient.\nMr. Maduro said in a televised broadcast this month that Venezuela would take in 2,000 Cuban doctors who left Brazil after a dispute between the Brazilian and Cuban governments. Medical clinics run by Cuban doctors once proliferated throughout Venezuela, but many have fallen into decay amid the economic crisis.\nPolitical advisers still have the ear of key officials in the Maduro administration, though Mr. Smilde said: \u201cCubans often complain that Maduro doesn\u2019t listen to them.\u201d\nBut perhaps most crucially to Mr. Maduro, Cubans remain a key component in the intelligence and military sectors, providing assistance with domestic surveillance, electronic wiretapping, and internal military surveillance \u2014 to help squelch dissent and shore up loyalty, analysts said.\n\u201cA coup plot is a big worry,\u201d said Harold Trinkunas, deputy director at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University and an expert on Venezuela.\nIn the absence of a clear information about the extent of Cuban involvement in Venezuela, rumors have spiraled, and outside assessments have often been molded for political convenience.\nSpeaking at a United Nations Security Council meeting on Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed to Cuba\u2019s involvement in Venezuela, saying its intelligence officers have brought their \u201cown worst practices\u201d to Caracas.\n\u201cNo regime has done more to sustain the nightmarish conditions in Venezuela than the regime in Havana,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.\nThere is plenty of motivation for Cuba to remain as involved as possible to shore up the Maduro administration. Havana risks losing an important economic benefactor, not to mention a leftist ally in a region that has lately seen a rightward shift.\nShould Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the opposition gain control in Caracas, \u201cthat would, of course, be very bad news for Havana,\u201d Mr. Piccone said. \u201cThey will very quickly change the relationship with Cuba.\u201d\nMegan Specia contributed reporting from New York.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/world/americas/venezuela-cuba-oil.html", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.84178"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.28476"}, {"label": "cuban-americans", "score": "0.18849"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.16808"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.09043"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.07153"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.06800"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.06603"}, {"label": "coups d'etat and attempted coups d'etat", "score": "0.05675"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.03931"}, {"label": "intelligence", "score": "0.03666"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.03524"}, {"label": "cuba-international relations-us", "score": "0.02540"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02295"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.02172"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01769"}, {"label": "intelligence services", "score": "0.01724"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.01502"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.01379"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01379"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.01350"}, {"label": "reform and reorganization", "score": "0.01099"}, {"label": "appointments and executive changes", "score": "0.01090"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00971"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.00904"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.00898"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.00758"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00725"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.00682"}, {"label": "real estate", "score": "0.00634"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Venezuela", "Cuba", "MEXICO CITY", "Florida", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Venezuela", "the United States", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "San Diego", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "Cuba", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Venezuela", "Venezuela", "the United States", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "Cuba", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "the United States", "Venezuela", "Brazil", "Venezuela", "Venezuela", "Venezuela", "Cuba", "Venezuela", "Caracas", "Venezuela", "Havana", "Cuba", "Havana", "Caracas", "Havana", "Cuba", "New York"], "ORG": ["Spies", "Cuba &", "the University of California", "Tulane University", "the Organization of American States", "the Brookings Institution", "the Brookings Institution", "Pdvsa", "the Center for International Security and Cooperation", "Stanford University", "United Nations Security Council", "State"], "PERSON": ["Juan Guaid\u00f3", "Marco Rubio", "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro", "Guiad\u00f3", "Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel", "Maduro", "Maduro", "Maduro", "Mar\u00eda Corina Machado", "Maduro", "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez", "Ch\u00e1vez", "Fidel Castro", "Richard Feinberg", "Ch\u00e1vez", "David Smilde", "Luis Almagro", "Maduro", "Maduro", "Ted Piccone", "Maduro", "Piccone", "Maduro", "Maduro", "Smilde", "Maduro", "Maduro", "Harold Trinkunas", "Mike Pompeo", "Pompeo", "Maduro", "Guaid\u00f3", "Piccone", "Megan Specia"]}}, {"index": 87, "year": 2019, "title": "The Real Wall Isn\u2019t at the Border", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/border-wall-immigration-trump.html", "text_content": "Supported by\nThe Real Wall Isn\u2019t at the Border\nIt\u2019s everywhere, and we\u2019re fighting against the wrong one.\nMs. Abrahamian is the author of \u201cThe Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen.\u201d\nPresident Trump wants $5.7 billion to build a wall at the southern border of the United States. Nancy Pelosi thinks a wall is \u201cimmoral.\u201d The fight over these slats or barriers or bricks shut down the government for more than a month and may do so again if Mr. Trump isn\u2019t satisfied with the way negotiations unfold over the next three weeks.\nBut let\u2019s be clear: This is a disagreement about symbolism, not policy. Liberals object less to aggressive border security than to the wall\u2019s xenophobic imagery, while the administration openly revels in its political incorrectness. And when this particular episode is over, we\u2019ll still have been fighting about the wrong thing. It\u2019s true that immigrants will keep trying to cross into the United States and that global migration will almost certainly increase in the coming years as climate change makes parts of the planet uninhabitable. But technology and globalization are complicating the idea of what a border is and where it stands.\nNot long from now, it won\u2019t make sense to think of the border as a line, a wall or even any kind of imposing vertical structure. Tearing down, or refusing to fund, border walls won\u2019t get anyone very far in the broader pursuit of global justice. The borders of the future won\u2019t be as easy to spot, build or demolish as the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing. That\u2019s because they aren\u2019t just going up around countries \u2014 they\u2019re going up around us. And they\u2019re taking away our freedom.\nIn \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d a play about a refugee camp in Calais, France, a Kurdish smuggler named Ali explains that his profession is not responsible for the large numbers of migrants making the dangerous journeys to Europe by sea. \u201cOnce, I was the only way a man could ever dream of arriving on your shore,\u201d the smuggler says. But today, migrants can plan out the journeys using their phones. \u201cIt is not about this border. It\u2019s the border in here,\u201d Ali says, pointing to his head \u2014 \u201cand that is gone, now.\u201d\nPresident Trump is obsessed with his border wall because technology has freed us from the walls in our heads.\nFor people with means and passports, it\u2019s easy to plot exotic itineraries in a flash and book flights with just a glance at a screen. Social feeds are an endless stream of old faces in new places: a carefree colleague feeding elephants in Thailand; a smug college classmate on a \u201cbabymoon\u201d in Tahiti; that awful ex hanging off a cliff in Switzerland; a friend\u2019s parents enjoying retirement in New Zealand.\nLikewise, a young person in Sana, Yemen, or Guatemala City might see a sister in Toronto, a neighbor in Phoenix, an aunt in London or a teacher in Berlin, and think that he, too, could start anew. Foreign places are real. Another country is possible.\nIf you zoom out enough in Google Earth, you\u2019ll see the lines between nations begin to disappear. Eventually, you\u2019ll be left staring at a unified blue planet. You might even experience a hint of what astronauts have called the \u201coverview effect\u201d: the sense that we are all on \u201cSpaceship Earth,\u201d together. \u201cFrom space I saw Earth \u2014 indescribably beautiful with the scars of national boundaries gone,\u201d recalled Muhammed Faris, a Syrian astronaut, after his 1987 mission to space. In 2012, Mr. Faris fled war-torn Syria for Turkey.\nOne\u2019s freedom of movement used to be largely determined by one\u2019s citizenship, national origin and finances. That\u2019s still the case \u2014 but increasingly, people are being categorized not just by the color of their passports or their ability to pay for tickets but also by where they\u2019ve been and what they\u2019ve said in the past.\nThis is what is happening on that front already:\nA 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with Muslim majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the Obama administration compelled anyone who\u2019d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the United States. Even as the Trump administration\u2019s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering the United States, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country.\nThe Trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who\u2019ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a \u201cpublic charge.\u201d If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants\u2019 living rooms, schools and hospital beds.\nThe walls of the future go beyond one administration\u2019s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, the United States announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent Twitter-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation has said these practices can \u201cchill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the United States, as well as the U.S. persons who communicate with them.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.\nIt\u2019s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from China. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt could one day jeopardize someone\u2019s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.\nThe Berkeley political theorist Wendy Brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state\u2019s looming impotence in the face of globalization \u2014 the flashy sports car of what she calls a \u201cwaning sovereignty.\u201d In a recent interview for The Nation, Professor Brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of \u201cbounded territory itself is in crisis.\u201d They are signifiers of a \u201closs of a national \u2018we\u2019 and national control \u2014 all the things we\u2019ve seen erupt in a huge way.\u201d\nWalls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who \u2014 or what \u2014 is trying to pass through.\nIt\u2019s far too easy to imagine a situation where our freedom of movement still depends entirely on what has happened to us in the past and what kind of information we\u2019re willing to give up in return. Consider the expedited screening process of the Global Entry Program for traveling to the United States. It\u2019s a shortcut \u2014 reserved for people who can get it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t do away with borders. It just makes them easier to cross, and therefore less visible.\nThat serves the modern nation-state very well. Because in the end, what are borders supposed to protect us from? The answer used to be other states, empires or sovereigns. But today, relatively few land borders exist to physically fend off a neighboring power, and countries even cooperate to police the borders they share. Modern borders exist to control something else: the movement of people. They control us.\nThose are the walls we should be fighting over.\nAtossa Araxia Abrahamian (@atossaaraxia) is the author of \u201cThe Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen\u201d and an editor at The Nation.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/opinion/sunday/border-wall-immigration-trump.html", "tags": [{"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.65828"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.20422"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.05703"}, {"label": "illegal aliens", "score": "0.05530"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.04090"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.03733"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.03061"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.02684"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01606"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.01491"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01448"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.01239"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.01221"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.01170"}, {"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.01150"}, {"label": "budgets and budgeting", "score": "0.01094"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01078"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.01022"}, {"label": "illegal immigrants", "score": "0.00940"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00918"}, {"label": "foreign labor", "score": "0.00896"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.00884"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.00866"}, {"label": "asylum (political)", "score": "0.00759"}, {"label": "language and languages", "score": "0.00732"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00731"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00692"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00649"}, {"label": "weather", "score": "0.00625"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.00610"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["the United States", "the United States", "Calais", "France", "Thailand", "Switzerland", "New Zealand", "Sana", "Yemen", "Guatemala City", "Toronto", "Phoenix", "London", "Berlin", "Syria", "Turkey", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "the United States", "U.S.", "China", "Berkeley", "the United States"], "ORG": ["Customs and Border Protection", "The Electronic Frontier Foundation", "The Nation", "the Global Entry Program", "The Nation", "The New York Times Opinion", "Facebook", "Instagram"], "PERSON": ["Abrahamian", "Trump", "Nancy Pelosi", "Trump", "Trump", "Ali", "Ali", "Trump", "Muhammed Faris", "Faris", "Obama", "Trump", "Trump", "Wendy Brown", "Brown", "Atossa Araxia Abrahamian"]}}, {"index": 88, "year": 2018, "title": "Targets of U.S. Sanctions Hire Lobbyists With Trump Ties to Seek Relief", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html#click=https://t.co/fifCDOsGnL", "text_content": "Supported by\nTargets of U.S. Sanctions Hire Lobbyists With Trump Ties to Seek Relief\nWASHINGTON \u2014 On a July evening, Trump administration officials and allies, including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, gathered with investors atop the Hay-Adams hotel overlooking the White House for a cocktail reception featuring a short presentation by the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s special envoy to the United States.\nAn invitation for the reception billed it as an opportunity to learn about \u201cthe role Africa plays in gaining access to critical minerals, such as cobalt\u201d and to discuss \u201cthe strategic relationship\u201d between the United States and the nations of Africa.\nIn fact, the reception was part of an aggressive $8 million lobbying and public relations campaign that used lobbyists with ties to the Trump administration to try to ease concerns about the Congolese president, Joseph Kabila, whose government was facing threats of additional sanctions from the Trump administration for human rights abuses and corruption.\nThe lavish cocktail party was one example of a lucrative and expanding niche within Washington\u2019s influence industry. As President Trump\u2019s administration has increasingly turned to sanctions, travel restrictions and tariffs to punish foreign governments as well as people and companies from abroad, targets of those measures have turned for assistance to Washington\u2019s K Street corridor of law, lobbying and public relations firms.\nThe work can carry reputational and legal risks, since clients often come with toxic baggage and the United States Treasury Department restricts transactions with entities under sanctions. As a result, it commands some of the biggest fees of any sector in the influence industry. And some of the biggest payments have been going to lobbyists, lawyers and consultants with connections to Mr. Trump or his administration.\n\u201cPeople overseas often want to hear that you know so-and-so, and can make a call to solve their problem,\u201d said Erich Ferrari, a leading Washington sanctions lawyer who said he has tried to disabuse prospective clients of such notions.\nIt is a perception that matches up with the pay-to-play mind-set that defines politics in many parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the former Soviet states. As politicians and executives from those regions have increasingly been targeted by sanctions, they have sought to apply that approach \u2014 backed by huge sums of cash \u2014 to navigating Washington, lobbyists and former government officials say.\nThis has been encouraged, they say, by the willingness projected by Mr. Trump and his team to make deals around sanctions and tariffs exemptions. Previous administrations had worked to wall off politics from those processes, which are supposed to be overseen primarily by career officials and governed by strict legal analyses.\nIn June, after a personal intervention by Mr. Trump, the Commerce Department rescinded sanctions that could have crippled the Chinese technology giant ZTE, which had fought the sanctions through an intense three-month lobbying push that cost $1.4 million.\nA $108,500-a-month lobbying campaign has helped delay the imposition of sanctions against an industrial conglomerate owned by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Among the leaders of the lobbying efforts for both ZTE and Mr. Deripaska\u2019s companies was Bryan Lanza, a former Trump campaign aide who maintains close ties to administration officials.\nHis firm, Mercury Public Affairs, has signed other clients facing punitive measures from the United States government, including the United States subsidiary of Hikvision, a company owned by the Chinese government.\nThe company, according to lobbying filings, paid a Mercury team including Mr. Lanza a fee that started at $70,000 a month to lobby on the carrying out of a military-spending bill. The bill bars the United States government from purchasing video surveillance products made by a handful of Chinese companies, including Hikvision, ZTE and Huawei, whose chief financial officer was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States government, apparently on suspicion of violating sanctions against Iran.\nSanctions targets who had not previously tried to win reprieve are sensing an opening. Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former president of Ukraine, who had sanctions levied against him in 2014, has discussed a push to win relief and refurbish his image with well-connected law and lobbying firms including Greenberg Traurig.\nAmong the other Trump-linked lobbyists who have received big contracts from targets of sanctions and tariffs is Brian Ballard, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee.\nHis firm signed a $125,000-a-month contract in August 2017 to represent the Turkish-state-owned bank Halkbank, which has been working to avoid punishment for its role in a billion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. The representation brought Mr. Ballard into discussions with Mr. Giuliani, who represented a gold trader charged in the scheme.\nThen there is the lawyer Alan Dershowitz. His criticism of the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Mr. Trump has endeared him to the president. But Mr. Dershowitz also has a long history of representing clients in transnational legal matters, including sanctions.\nMr. Dershowitz is advising Dan Gertler, an Israeli billionaire who was the target of sanctions by Washington last year for using his connections to Mr. Kabila, the Congolese president, to facilitate what the Treasury Department called \u201copaque and corrupt mining and oil deals.\u201d\nMr. Dershowitz called Mr. Gertler \u201ca very good person\u201d who is \u201cbeing targeted primarily because of the actions of other people.\u201d\nWhile Mr. Trump has invited Mr. Dershowitz to the White House to discuss Middle East issues on multiple occasions, Mr. Dershowitz said he had not used his access to lobby on behalf of Mr. Gertler.\n\u201cI would never raise an issue like this,\u201d he said.\nMr. Kabila\u2019s government has stocked up on consultants who have cast themselves as able to broker access at the highest levels of the administration. It has paid $8 million to its security contractor, an Israeli firm called Mer Security and Communication Systems, to hire American lobbyists, according to lobbying filings.\nMer paid $500,000 in April 2017 to Alston & Bird, the firm of former Senator Bob Dole. Mr. Dole\u2019s team indicated that it could secure a meeting between Mr. Kabila and Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the relationship. The meeting never happened, and Mer ended the subcontract in frustration.\nMer proceeded to invest millions more in lobbying and public relations firms with lower profiles but closer ties to the Trump team.\nLobbying filings show $360,000 paid by Mer to Adnan Jalil, a former congressional liaison for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign; $250,000 to the firm of Nancye Miller, the wife of the Trump campaign adviser and former C.I.A. chief R. James Woolsey Jr.; $680,000 to the firm of former Representative Robert L. Livingston, an early Trump endorser; and $598,000 to the firm of Brian Glicklich, who has represented Trump allies such as Breitbart News and Rush Limbaugh.\nMer also agreed to pay $1.25 million to the firm of Robert Stryk, who had worked with Trump campaign officials, to organize the Hay-Adams event and meetings around it for Mr. Kabila\u2019s special envoy to the United States. (Mr. Stryk\u2019s firm, Sonoran Policy Group, also signed a $100,000-a-month contract in August to represent Somalia in its bid for increased military aid from the Trump administration and removal from its travel ban list. And Sonoran registered as a subcontractor for a law firm to lobby for a notorious Serbian arms dealer who was hit with sanctions for selling weapons to Liberia).\nAt the time of the Congolese reception, the Trump administration and the international community were pressuring Mr. Kabila to step down, partly by intimating that his allies might face additional sanctions. Not only had he been accused of violent repression of dissent and looting millions, but he had overstayed the country\u2019s constitutionally mandated term limits by nearly two years.\nThe Congolese officials at the reception posed for photos with Mr. Giuliani, and afterward there was some confusion about his connection to the lobbying effort.\nFrancois Balumuene, the Congolese ambassador to the United States, suggested in an interview in September that his country was working with Mr. Giuliani to figure out the administration\u2019s position on an upcoming presidential election called by Mr. Kabila to avoid threatened sanctions.\n\u201cWhat I know is that it is possible that Giuliani will let us know how to go ahead,\u201d Mr. Balumuene said. He referred additional questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role to the country\u2019s special envoy to Washington, Raymond Tshibanda, who could not be reached for comment.\nMr. Giuliani said he was not serving as an intermediary between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the administration. In an interview in September, he initially said he stopped by the reception for a half-hour to \u201csay hello to people\u201d and to impress a woman with whom he had been dining by taking her \u201cto the top of the Hay-Adams to see a Washington party\u201d with a \u201cgreat view.\u201d\nBut he later suggested that he attended at least partly because he was interested in exploring business opportunities, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to see what\u2019s Africa all about.\u201d\nAnd someone familiar with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s business affairs said that one of his companies has recently been negotiating a consulting deal to work in the Democratic Republic of Congo, possibly through Mer.\nIn text messages on Sunday, Mr. Giuliani said that \u201cif I do it, it would only be security consulting\u201d similar to what he does in other countries, not lobbying. \u201cBeyond that, I can\u2019t say anything other than you can assume if we are working in a foreign country, we are doing security \u2014 physical and cyber, antiterrorism, emergency management.\u201d\nIt is not clear whether the lobbying overseen by Mer had much effect, and several of Mer\u2019s subcontracts with Trump-linked lobbyists have expired.\nLess than a month after the Hay-Adams event, Mr. Kabila announced that he would not seek a third term in presidential elections scheduled for this month. While some Trump administration officials are concerned that the elections are being tilted in favor of Mr. Kabila\u2019s chosen successor, the United States has not leveled additional sanctions against the country since Mr. Kabila\u2019s announcement \u2014 an outcome some lobbyists on the account are privately claiming as a victory.\nIn October, Mer signed a new $200,000 contract with a public relations firm called Sanitas International that was co-founded by Christopher Harvin, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign who had worked in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. The firm is seeking to demonstrate to the news media that Mr. Kabila does, in fact, intend to step down and hold free and fair elections.\nJesse Drucker contributed to this report.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/us/politics/sanctions-lobbyists-usa.html#click=https://t.co/fifCDOsGnL", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.96085"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.81505"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.75088"}, {"label": "embargoes and economic sanctions", "score": "0.50071"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.42577"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.30346"}, {"label": "lobbying and lobbyists", "score": "0.28146"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.25337"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.23512"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.18908"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.16741"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.13964"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.10817"}, {"label": "foreign investments", "score": "0.06501"}, {"label": "bribery", "score": "0.06434"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.05671"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.04522"}, {"label": "multinational companies", "score": "0.04385"}, {"label": "sales", "score": "0.02891"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.02872"}, {"label": "oil (petroleum) and gasoline", "score": "0.02799"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.02668"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.02461"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.02315"}, {"label": "sanctions (economic)", "score": "0.02284"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.02275"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01926"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01570"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01514"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01412"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["WASHINGTON", "the United States", "the United States", "Washington", "Washington", "Washington", "Washington", "Trump", "United States", "United States", "United States", "Canada", "United States", "Iran", "Ukraine", "Trump", "Iran", "Washington", "the United States", "Somalia", "Liberia", "the United States", "Washington", "Washington", "the Democratic Republic of Congo", "Trump", "the United States"], "ORG": ["U.S. Sanctions Hire Lobbyists", "the Hay-Adams hotel", "the White House", "the Democratic Republic of Congo", "the United States Treasury Department", "the Commerce Department", "ZTE", "ZTE", "Mercury Public Affairs", "Hikvision", "Mercury", "Hikvision", "ZTE", "Huawei", "Greenberg Traurig", "the Republican National Committee", "Halkbank", "the Treasury Department", "the White House", "Mer Security and Communication Systems", "Mer", "Alston & Bird", "Mer", "Mer", "Mer", "C.I.A.", "Trump", "Breitbart News", "Mer", "Hay-Adams", "Sonoran Policy Group", "the Democratic Republic of Congo", "the Hay-Adams", "Mer", "Mer", "Mer", "the Hay-Adams", "Mer", "Sanitas International"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Rudolph W.

That charge is usually applied to critics of the ruling Communist Party who are accused of organizing political challenges.\nOther lawyers and activists who had been picked up in an expansive campaign by the government that began in the summer of 2015 were either released or put on trial and sentenced. But Mr. Wang, 42, had been held for nearly three and a half years before he faced charges in a closed trial in Tianjin on Dec. 26 that even his wife was barred from attending.\nThe crackdown, which included televised show trials in which lawyers confessed to plotting to overthrow the government and working on behalf of foreign forces, is a part of President Xi Jinping\u2019s efforts to obliterate threats to the party\u2019s control.\nMr. Wang\u2019s wife, Li Wenzu, condemned the decision on Monday, accusing the police, prosecutors and judge of committing crimes by detaining her husband for more than three years.\n\u201cI will continue to fight for the rights of Wang Quanzhang,\u201d Ms. Li said in a Twitter post. \u201cI will look after our child and wait for Wang Quanzhang to come home.\u201d\nCalls to Ms. Li\u2019s mobile phone went unanswered. It was unclear whether Mr. Wang would appeal the decision. Since Mr. Wang has been in custody since August 2015, it is possible he could be released next year, legal experts said.\nMr. Wang was one of most prominent figures to be swept up in the campaign against rights activists. As a lawyer at the Beijing Fengrui law firm, he represented members of a banned religious group, Falun Gong, and helped train legal activists.\nProsecutors had accused Mr. Wang of \u201cstirring up trouble\u201d and colluding with foreign-funded groups.\nHuman rights advocates and Western governments have raised concerns over the Chinese government\u2019s handling of the case. Mr. Wang\u2019s relatives and friends have not been allowed to see him.\nGermany\u2019s human rights commissioner, B\u00e4rbel Kofler, on Monday called the sentencing \u201ccompletely incomprehensible.\u201d\n\u201cWang Quanzhang has done nothing but advocate within the legal framework as a lawyer in China for disenfranchised citizens and politically persecuted people,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThere are also concerns that he might have faced abuse while in prison. Several lawyers who were detained in 2015 have said they were abused while in custody.\n\u201cPeople are saying that he is too stubborn for his own good and that he\u2019s not going to cave in,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London who studies Chinese rights lawyers and knows Mr. Wang. \u201cYou just have to worry about the basic state of his mental and physical health.\u201d\nThe government has continued its campaign against human rights advocates, disbarring lawyers who take on cases the party sees as a threat and keeping others under surveillance.\nExperts said that Mr. Wang\u2019s sentencing would most likely deepen concerns among China\u2019s legal rights advocates, a small but daring group of lawyers who help dissidents, religious leaders, aggrieved farmers and others fight everyday injustices.\nDoriane Lau, a China researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong, called Mr. Wang\u2019s trial a \u201csham.\u201d\n\u201cHe is being imprisoned solely for doing his job,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will have a chilling effect on the many human rights lawyers in China who are still fighting very hard for justice.\u201d\nFollow Javier C.

Early Monday, federal officials raided his home, removing computer equipment and boxes in an operation that represents another setback for this struggling seaside city.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. was at the mayor\u2019s home in Atlantic City in an official capacity executing a search warrant,\u201d said Doreen Holder, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.\u2019s office in Newark. Ms. Holder said the I.R.S. was also involved in the search, but she declined to offer any other details.\nVideo posted on social media showed about a dozen agents going in and out of the home on Ohio Avenue.\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to comment about what prompted the raid.\n\u201cWe can tell you that the mayor\u2019s office is open, and we are here to provide services to Atlantic City residents and to serve the administration in any way that we can,\u201d said Christina Bevilacqua, the deputy chief of staff in the mayor\u2019s office.\nShortly after 12:30 p.m. Monday, Mr. Gilliam emerged from his house and left in a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. He did not respond to shouted questions from reporters gathered at the end of his driveway.\nThe F.B.I. operation is the latest chapter in what has been a tumultuous couple of months for Mr. Gilliam, a Democrat. The late-night brawl he was involved in took place outside the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City; surveillance video obtained from the casino showed the mayor swinging wildly at an unknown man. Casino security intervened to break up the fight.\nThe cause of the melee has never been made clear. Prosecutors said they would not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Gilliam.\nMr. Gilliam has also faced complaints about his campaign finances. The mayor and the Atlantic City Democratic Committee quarreled over a $10,000 check that had been made out to the committee, but that Mr. Gilliam deposited into his campaign account.\nThe committee filed a criminal complaint in March, but a judge later dismissed the case.\nMr. Gilliam was elected in 2017, defeating the incumbent mayor Don Guardian, a Republican who had clashed frequently with the administration of former Gov. Chris Christie over the state\u2019s decision to take over Atlantic City\u2019s finances. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy as its casino industry struggled.\nMr. Gilliam, a native of Atlantic City who had served as a city councilman since 2009, campaigned on a \u201cnew era\u201d message, saying that Atlantic City\u2019s struggles were the result of poor management of city government and the casinos. He faulted Mr. Guardian for allowing the state takeover and said the largely Democratic city needed to return to its Democratic roots.\nHe promised to court developers and bring in businesses. Since taking office, two casinos have opened where old ones had shuttered.\nBut he also promised to broaden Atlantic City\u2019s appeal, seeking to establish the resort city as a family-friendly destination.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our identity because of gaming,\u201d Mr. Gilliam said during the campaign. \u201cIf everyone got to the table, Atlantic City would find its way.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. raid on Mr. Gilliam\u2019s home, however, is a reminder of the long history of criminal behavior among some of Atlantic City\u2019s top public officials.\nRobert W. Levy, who was elected mayor in 2006, disappeared in 2007 amid rumors of a pending federal investigation into his military record and benefits. He was found to have checked into an addiction and rehabilitation facility in central New Jersey, and later admitted in court to falsifying his military records to receive veterans benefits.\nIn 1991, James L. Usry, who had been mayor for six years and was Atlantic City\u2019s first elected African-American mayor, pleaded guilty to campaign contribution violations after prosecutors accused of him accepting $6,000 in cash and a $500 check in exchange for supporting an ordinance that would have benefited a business owned by the donor. Mr. Usry and four city councilmen were indicted.\nAnd in 1984, Michael J. Matthews, who had been elected mayor in 1982, was charged with extortion, bribery and conspiracy as part of a wide-ranging sting operation against organized crime. Federal authorities said he maintained a close relationship with Nicodemo \u201cLittle Nicky\u201d Scarfo, an infamous organized crime leader, that predated Mr. Matthews\u2019s election as mayor. Mr. Matthews pleaded guilty to a single count of extortion.\nAtlantic City also played a central role in the Abscam scandal, which resulted in the convictions of several members of Congress on charges of bribery and political corruption, including Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey.\nAt the center of the scandal were promises for casino partnerships and revenue in Atlantic City.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you Atlantic City \u2014 without me, you do nothing,\u201d Angelo J. Errichetti, who was then mayor of Camden, N.J., boasted to an undercover agent about arranging a casino license for a $50,000 kickback.\nAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/nyregion/mayor-frank-gilliam-atlantic-city.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytmetro", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.10095"}, {"label": "mayors", "score": "0.05754"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.05004"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03387"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.02801"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02795"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.02716"}, {"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.01851"}, {"label": "games", "score": "0.01675"}, {"label": "gambling", "score": "0.01541"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.01508"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.01425"}, {"label": "real estate", "score": "0.01145"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01097"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01095"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.00886"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.00854"}, {"label": "casinos", "score": "0.00838"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00769"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00740"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00607"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.00553"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.00529"}, {"label": "search and seizure", "score": "0.00439"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.00407"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00396"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00389"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.00387"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.00386"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00379"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["New York", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Newark", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "New Jersey", "Atlantic City\u2019s", "Atlantic City", "New Jersey", "Atlantic City", "Atlantic City", "Camden", "N.J."], "ORG": ["F.B.I.

Officials have long suspected Huawei of working to advance Beijing\u2019s global ambitions and undermine America\u2019s interests and have begun taking steps to curb its international presence.\nThe charges underscore Washington\u2019s determination to prove that Huawei poses a national security threat and to convince other nations that it cannot be trusted to build their next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The indictments, based in part on the company\u2019s internal emails, describe a plot to steal testing equipment from T-Mobile laboratories in Bellevue, Wash. They also cite internal memos, obtained from Ms. Meng, that prosecutors said link her to an elaborate bank fraud that helped Huawei profit by evading Iran sanctions.\nThe acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, flanked by the heads of several other cabinet agencies, said the United States would seek to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at the request of the United States.\nThe charges outlined Monday come at a sensitive diplomatic moment, as top officials from China are expected to arrive in Washington this week for two days of talks aimed at resolving a monthslong trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Trump administration officials have insisted that Ms. Meng\u2019s detention will not affect the trade talks, but the timing of the indictment coming so close to in-person discussions is likely to further strain relations between the two countries.\nMs. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder and one of the most powerful industrialists in the country. Her arrest has outraged the Chinese government, which has since arrested two Canadians, in apparent retaliation. The indictment now presents Canada with a politically charged decision: whether to extradite Ms. Meng to face the fraud charges, or make a legal or political determination to send her back to Beijing.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry called on the United States and Canada to let Ms. Meng go.\n\u201cFor a long time, the U.S. has used state power to smear and attack certain Chinese companies in an attempt to stifle legitimate business operations,\u201d it said. \u201cBehind that, there is strong political motivation and manipulation. We strongly urge the U.S. to stop unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies, including Huawei, and treat Chinese enterprises fairly and objectively.\u201d\nA spokesman for Huawei, Joe Kelly, said it \u201cis not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion.\u201d The company also denied violating American laws.\nThe indictment unsealed against Ms. Meng is similar to the charges leveled against the Huawei executive in filings made by federal prosecutors in connection with the bail hearing in Canada. It claimed that Huawei defrauded four large banks into clearing transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions through a subsidiary called Skycom. Federal authorities did not identify the banks, but in an earlier court proceeding in Canada after Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, prosecutors had identified one of the banks as HSBC.\nThe most serious new allegation in the indictment, which could have bearing on the extradition proceeding in Canada, is the contention by federal prosecutors that Huawei sought to impede the investigation into the telecom company\u2019s attempt to evade economic sanctions on Iran by destroying or concealing evidence.\nThe indictment said Huawei moved employees out of the United States so they could not be called as witnesses before a grand jury in Brooklyn. And authorities said the company destroyed evidence in order to hinder the inquiry.\nRichard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said that the telecom firm\u2019s actions began in 2007 and \u201callowed Iran to evade sanctions imposed by the United States and to allow Huawei to profit.\u201d\nMs. Meng\u2019s lawyer in the United States, Reid Weingarten, a leading white-collar lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, said that his client \u201cshould not be a pawn or hostage\u201d in the relationship between the United States and China.\n\u201cMs. Meng is an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any U.S. law, including the Iranian sanctions,\u201d Mr. Weingarten said. \u201cWe are confident that justice will be done.\u201d\nThe arrest of a top executive for sanctions evasion is unusual. In 2015, Deutsche Bank was fined $258 million for violating American sanctions on Iran and Syria. No executives involved in the scheme were indicted, though six employees were fired.\nMs. Meng is under house arrest at one of two residences that she owns in Vancouver. American officials said Monday that they will request her extradition before a deadline on Wednesday. The next stage of her case will be decided at the Supreme Court of British Columbia.\n\u201cCompanies like Huawei pose a dual threat to both our economic and national security,\u201d said Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, who joined Mr. Whitaker and two other cabinet members, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary.\nMr. Wray argued that \u201cthe magnitude of these charges make clear just how seriously the F.B.I. takes this threat.\u201d\n\u201cToday should serve as a warning that we will not tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct justice or jeopardize national and economic well-being,\u201d he added.\nParts of the indictment were redacted and left open the question of whether the United States had secretly indicted Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, a former People\u2019s Liberation Army officer and member of the Communist Party. A United States government interview with Mr. Ren from 2007 is cited in one of the indictments, to make the case that he misled investigators, and the name of at least one of those indicted is blacked out from the publicly filed version of the indictment.\nMr. Whitaker fueled the speculation about an indictment of Mr. Ren when he told reporters on Monday that the criminal activity \u201cgoes all the way to the top of the company.\u201d\nThe Justice Department also accused Huawei of conspiring to steal trade secrets from a competitor, T-Mobile. The charges relate to a criminal investigation that stemmed from a 2014 civil suit between the two companies.\nIn that case, T-Mobile accused Huawei of stealing proprietary robotics technology that the telecom company used to diagnose quality-control issues in cellphones. Huawei was found guilty in May 2017. The indictment cited internal emails from Huawei and its American subsidiary that appeared to set up a bonus system for employees who could illicitly obtain the T-Mobile testing system.\n\u201cThese are very serious actions by a company that appears to be using corporate espionage not only to enhance their bottom line but to compete in the world economy,\u201d Mr. Whitaker said.\nThe legal drama now shifts to Canada, where the government has warned that it will not extradite Ms. Meng if it appears that the request is being made for political reasons. President Trump said after her arrest that he would consider using her case for leverage in the upcoming trade negotiations, which fueled speculation that the United States may be more interested in Ms. Meng\u2019s value in winning trade concessions than in obtaining a conviction.\nCanada\u2019s ambassador to Beijing was fired over the weekend by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for suggesting that the case against Ms. Meng was political and that Canada might accede to Chinese demands and return her home.\nMr. Whitaker declined to say Monday whether the White House would interfere in the criminal case against Ms. Meng. But the array of officials present at the announcement was clearly intended to demonstrate a coordinated government effort to go after Huawei.\n\u201cGiven the seriousness of these charges, and the direct involvement of cabinet officials in their rollout, today\u2019s announcements underscore that there is a unified full-court press by the administration to hold China accountable for the theft of proprietary U.S. technology and violations of U.S. export control and sanctions laws,\u201d said David Laufman, the former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s counterintelligence and export control section.\nThe indictments could further complicate the trade talks that the administration is holding this week with Beijing. The Trump administration is seeking significant changes to China\u2019s trade practices, including what it says is a pattern of Beijing pressuring American companies to hand over valuable technology and outright theft of intellectual property.\n\u201cThe Americans are not going to surrender global technological supremacy without a fight, and the indictment of Huawei is the opening shot in that struggle,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration.\nLawmakers like Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who have long argued for action to be taken against Chinese technology providers including Huawei and ZTE, a smaller firm that has faced similar accusations, called the indictment \u201ca reminder that we need to take seriously the risks of doing business with companies like Huawei and allowing them access to our markets.\u201d\nMr. Warner said that he would continue to press Canada to reconsider using any Huawei technology as it upgrades its telecommunications network.\nOn Tuesday, American intelligence officials are expected to cite 5G investments by Chinese telecom companies, including Huawei, as a worldwide threat. And the United States has been drafting an executive order, expected in the coming weeks, that would effectively ban American companies from using Chinese-origin equipment in critical telecommunications networks.\nDavid E.

It is the point farthest from a sea or ocean on the planet. Located in China just east of the border with Kazakhstan, the pole gets you a good distance from harbors and coastlines \u2014 at least 1,550 miles in any direction \u2014 into an expanse of white steppe and blue-beige mountain that is among the least populated places on earth. Here, among some of the last surviving pastoral nomads in Central Asia, nestled between two branches of the Tian Shan range on the edge of Kazakhstan, the largest infrastructure project in the history of the world is growing.\nAbout 80 miles from the Pole of Inaccessibility, just across the border in Kazakhstan, is a village called Khorgos. It has spent most of its existence on the obscure periphery of international affairs, and its official population is just 908. But over the last few years, it has become an important node of the global economy. It is part of an initiative known informally as the new Silk Road, a China-led effort to build a vast cephalopodic network of highways, railroads and overseas shipping routes, supported by hundreds of new plants, pipelines and company towns in dozens of countries. Ultimately, the Belt and Road Initiative, or B.R.I., as the project is more formally known, will link China\u2019s coastal factories and rising consumer class with Central, Southeast and South Asia; with the Gulf States and the Middle East; with Africa; and with Russia and all of Europe, all by way of a lattice of land and sea routes whose collective ambition boggles the mind.\nKhorgos is a flagship project of this work in progress, an international shipping hub and free-trade zone that its promoters say is poised to become the next Dubai. Thanks to its location at the junction of the world\u2019s soon-to-be-largest national economy and its largest landlocked country, Khorgos has become an unlikely harbinger of the interconnected planet: a zone fully enclosed by the logic of globalization, where goods flow freely across sovereign borders, following corridors designed to locate every human being on the planet within a totalizing network of producers and consumers, buyers and sellers.\n[Read about China\u2019s $1 trillion plan to shake up the economic order.]\nSuch victories of the global and industrial over the local, isolated and rural are heralded as the inevitable future \u2014 if there is to be a future \u2014 of our species. What would that future look like? Whom would it benefit? What would it cost? To find out, last July I caught a sleeper train from Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, to the Chinese border, where I woke up in a train yard surrounded by desert.\nKhorgos is one of a cluster of villages encircling a former trading post of the ancient world called Zharkent. From Zharkent, I hoped to arrange a ride to the border. Frescoes of camel caravans flanked the entrance gate on Silk Road Avenue. In a central square stood a rainbow-colored mosque with the sweeping eaves of a Chinese pagoda and an inscription in Uighur enjoining visitors not to forget their past. Next to the mosque was the warren of chopped-up shipping containers that serves as Zharkent\u2019s central market. Taxi drivers hung unhopefully around the watermelon stands.\nAmong the drivers was a farmer named Nunur, who had come to Kazakhstan from China in 1962, when he was a young boy and Kazakhstan was a Soviet Socialist Republic. That year, more than 60,000 Chinese Uighurs and Kazakhs escaped to the Soviet Union, crossing with Soviet passports they received from the consulate in Xinjiang and with the apparent cooperation of Chinese border guards. Nunur remembered his parents walking him over red hills at night toward the checkpoint at Khorgos. \u201cThey opened the border and let us go into Soviet territory,\u201d he recalled. There were rumors that his relatives who stayed behind were imprisoned or killed. (Nunur, fearing trouble from the authorities, asked that I use only his first name.) His parents, who had raised wheat in China, found work on a collective farm. His mother became a cook while his father learned to drive tractors and Nunur to repair them. He became an expert mechanic. \u201cI\u2019m a master without a diploma,\u201d he said.\nI asked Nunur to drive me to a place near the border where we could take in the booming hub of Khorgos at a glance. On the way, we passed his cornfields, apportioned to him after the breakup of the collective farm. Even as Kazakhstan modernized following its 1991 independence, growing rich by regional standards from the sale of oil and outfitting a new capital city with glossy architectural marvels, the eastern border with China remained sparsely developed, its economy dominated by livestock and grain production. Nunur said his village still had no indoor plumbing, and as we left his fields we passed some of the ruins of centralized planning the Soviets left behind: a former winery, a shuttered milk plant.\nChina\u2019s plans are significantly more ambitious, and they reach far beyond eastern Kazakhstan. The \u201cbelt\u201d of the B.R.I. refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, a tangle of rail and highway routes currently vining their way untidily across the continent from eastern China to Scandinavia. The \u201croad\u201d is the Maritime Silk Road, a shipping lane that will connect Quanzhou to Venice, with prospective stops along the way in Malaysia, Ethiopia and Egypt. To date, at least 68 countries, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the planet\u2019s total population, have signed on to bilateral projects partly funded by China\u2019s policy banks and other state-owned enterprises. Chinese firms are building or investing in new highways and coal-fired power plants in Pakistan, ports in Greece and Sri Lanka, gas and oil pipelines in Central Asia, an industrial city in Oman and a $6 billion railway project in Laos, which in 2017 had a G.D.P. of less than $17 billion. China\u2019s port holdings stretch from Myanmar to Israel and from Mauritius to Belgium. It has spent an estimated $200 billion on B.R.I. projects so far, mostly in Asia, and has implied it will spend a total of $1 trillion on hundreds of projects around the world in the coming years, dwarfing the Marshall Plan by roughly an order of magnitude. When the investments from all the participating countries are combined, the estimated cost rises to $8 trillion.\nThe B.R.I. is so big and multifarious that describing it can feel like trying to narrate the weather conditions of the entire planet. Some individual components span hundreds of miles and are themselves dauntingly complex and international, like the $68 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or the stalled and scandal-mired Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor. Taken as a whole, the B.R.I. is unfathomable. But I had heard that, at Khorgos, a pioneering outpost, I could get closer than anywhere else to appreciating the scope of its aspirations.\nNunur drove me through his village to an overlook within view of a border sentry post, a few miles from the spot where he crossed into Kazakhstan almost six decades before. We parked near a small rock-crushing plant above a valley of bright green cornfields. Beyond the fields, through a blue haze, I could see this improbable new crossroads of the global economy.\nThe Chinese side of the border was easiest to spot. Since 2014, an instant city of 100,000 people, also called Khorgos (sometimes spelled Horgos), has appeared; its dark high-rises glittered in the sun. The Kazakh side of the border was less impressive from afar, but I knew it now hosted a first-of-its-kind free-trade zone, opened on territory shared with China. Behind a copse of cypress trees, I could also make out the gantry cranes of the new dry port \u2014 an inland shipping-and-logistics hub for freight trains \u2014 that began operating in 2015 and could soon be the largest port of its kind in the world. Adjacent to the dry port was a nascent railroad company town, and other plots nearby were cleared for factories and warehouses to be staffed by some of the future residents of the city of 100,000 that, if all goes as planned, will soon rise to match the one across the border.\n[ The Times\u2019s special report on how China became a superpower.]\nThe manager of the plant wandered over. He asked whether we wanted to get through the checkpoint, beyond which was the last village in Kazakhstan and, beyond that, China.\nWe got back in the car and pulled up to two guards who stood at the gate, rifles slung over their shoulders. They looked young and bored. The manager shouted the name of one of them, who walked shyly up to the passenger-side window. It seemed as if everyone in town knew everyone else.\n\u201cGive me some sunflower seeds,\u201d the manager said. The guard pulled a bag from his pocket and poured seeds into the manager\u2019s cupped hand until it overflowed. The manager explained that we wanted to see China. The guard shrugged and raised the boom gate.\nTwo miles beyond the checkpoint, across a valley of farmland, a tangerine ridge signaled the start of China\u2019s largest territory, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The border was somewhere in the valley beneath us. If we kept going, we would arrive at the Chinese sentry post we could just make out at the top of a train of switchbacks. We didn\u2019t test it, however. In recent years, the Chinese government has erected the most advanced police state in the world in Xinjiang, targeting the region\u2019s Turkic Muslims, especially its Uighur ethnic group, who make up about half the region\u2019s population. As part of what Chinese Communist Party literature describes as \u201cde-extremification\u201d efforts to combat terrorism, authorities have created an exclusion zone of state surveillance, arbitrary mass internment, brainwashing and torture that covers an area more than four times the size of Germany and includes a population almost as big as Australia\u2019s. According to the United States State Department, between 800,000 and two million people, or up to 15 percent of Xinjiang\u2019s Muslim population, have been incarcerated in a growing network of more than 1,000 concentration camps.\nYou couldn\u2019t see any of that from our perch at the border. Everything looked peaceful. To our left, a shepherd\u2019s path ascended into white-capped mountains where herdsmen grazed sheep and cattle in summer, far above the fields of corn and sunflowers. To our right, beyond the ridge, the high-modernist future of international commerce was springing up out of the ground. You could squint and imagine you were looking at a time-lapse photo of the entire history of collective human activity, from the first wandering goat-herder all the way to the present.\nChina has never released any official map of Belt and Road routes nor any list of approved projects, and it provides no exact count of participating nations or even guidelines on what it means to be a participant. But this fuzziness may be one of its defining advantages. Rather than a list of megaprojects and bilateral deals, some of which might stumble or fail, the B.R.I. can be understood as a vaguely visible hand guiding all the interlocking developments in infrastructure, energy and trade where China plays any kind of role.\nIt is also a framework through which China\u2019s leaders can present virtually any component of its foreign policy, from a soda-ash plant in Turkey to China\u2019s first foreign military base, in Djibouti, as part of a nonthreatening vision of what party representatives like to call \u201cwin win\u201d global development. In recent years, China has floated several expansions of President Xi Jinping\u2019s initial Belt and Road vision that make its scope seem all but limitless: the \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d into the frontiers of the virtual, the \u201cPacific Silk Road\u201d to South America, and the Arctic-crossing \u201cSilk Road on Ice.\u201d Xi himself has meanwhile extolled the merits of globalization at Davos and worked to brand his \u201cproject of the century\u201d as a natural extension of the spontaneous trade routes that once laced across the Eurasian continent.\nCritics have described the B.R.I. as a new kind of colonialism or even part of a strategy of \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy,\u201d seducing cash-poor countries with infrastructure projects that are unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover the interest on the loans that funded them. That is the unhappy situation at the China-funded Port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka, which the China Harbor Engineering Company took over after Sri Lanka fell behind on debt service. The Center for Global Development lists eight countries that face high risk of \u201cdebt distress\u201d from B.R.I. projects that they can\u2019t afford.\n[Read about China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America.]\nKazakhstan is poised to play a literally central role in China\u2019s plan. The B.R.I. was first announced in Astana, at a 2013 ceremony attended by Xi and Kazakhstan\u2019s longtime president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. At the same event, Xi and Nazarbayev also celebrated the opening of a joint gas pipeline and signed $30 billion worth of trade and investment agreements. Although in the past Kazakhstan\u2019s economy has tended to orbit Russia\u2019s, in 2007 China edged out Russia as Kazakhstan\u2019s top importer, and some critics fear that the B.R.I. is leading the country deeper into economic vassalage. \u201cSome people think that China is too big,\u201d Nygmet Ibadildin, an assistant professor of international relations at Kimep University, in Almaty, told me. \u201cKazakh people want a win-win with the B.R.I., but in these situations China wins more often.\u201d\nEven in a country with few meaningful democratic rights, there are risks to courting foreign investment. In 2016, a proposed law that would have permitted parcels of farmland to be leased to Chinese companies sparked nationwide protests, leading Nazarbayev to table the measure.\nThe human rights crisis in Xinjiang has not helped China\u2019s standing in Kazakhstan, either, although the Kazakh government has been careful not to make any public statements that might alienate an important economic partner. While diplomats may be negotiating on behalf of ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang behind closed doors \u2014 in January, the Kazakh foreign ministry announced that China would allow 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs to give up their citizenship and cross the border into Kazakhstan \u2014 the government is not letting the presence of a prison state across the border interfere with its collaboration with China.\nThat may be largely thanks to the immediate economic concerns of both states, not to mention a shared penchant for autocracy, but it may also owe something to the unprecedented nature of the B.R.I. In many participating countries, the project\u2019s very novelty seems to lend itself to gauzy optimism. In September, the Chinese state-run media group People\u2019s Daily commemorated the fifth anniversary of the B.R.I. with a music video modeled after Coca-Cola\u2019s famous 1971 \u201cI\u2019d Like to Buy the World a Coke\u201d TV spot. The new video featured altered lyrics like \u201cI\u2019d like to build the world a road/And furnish it with love,\u201d sung by smiling representatives of dozens of participant nations, decked out in ruquns, hijabs and dashikis. Rather than defining the initiative in any concrete way, the video slyly co-opts Coke\u2019s ability to serve as empty cipher, meaning anything to anyone. Whatever it is, the B.R.I. is \u201cwhat the world needs today/It\u2019s the real thing.\u201d\nKhorgos Gateway rises out of the flat desert basin, a pale yellow moon base of cranes and storage silos into which, every so often, a freight train slowly rolls. A trio of rail-mounted gantry cranes loomed 50 feet overhead as I arrived on a damp, overcast morning. Khorgos Gateway may be the most advanced port in Central Asia, but it retains some of eastern Kazakhstan\u2019s rustic atmosphere. When I walked into the lobby of the dry port\u2019s main offices, a security guard was handing out apples he had picked in his garden.\nThe chief executive of Khorgos Gateway, Zhaslan Khamzin, welcomed me into a tidy office overlooking the freight yard. \u201cThe future lies here,\u201d he said proudly. Khorgos was blessed by its position in the middle of Eurasia. \u201cLook at a map, and you\u2019ll see China on one side, Europe on the other, Russia to the north and the Caucasus and Iran to the east. Why am I pointing this out? Precisely because 90 percent of cargo traffic to these countries is currently made by sea.\u201d\nSince the dry port\u2019s inaugural train passed through in 2015, Khamzin said, companies who manufacture goods in China have begun to recognize the advantages of a modernized overland trade route across Asia. The dry port has transferred John Deere combines to Azerbaijan, he claimed, and Hewlett-Packard parts to Western Europe. He added that it may be much cheaper to ship containers by sea, but it can take more than three times as long, and air transit is the most expensive by far. By contrast, a container passing through Khorgos can travel from a Chinese point of origin to Europe in about 14 days, faster than the sea and cheaper than the air. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a central distribution point,\u201d he concluded. If all goes well, according to company forecasts, in a few years Khorgos Gateway will be the largest dry port in the world.\nOut in the shipping yard, wild dogs sniffed at stacked containers. It started to rain. A train had just pulled into port, and workers in yellow slickers were jogging out to meet it. Friendship between nations notwithstanding, Chinese border authorities are tight-lipped about freight schedules. The port sometimes learns about an impending arrival only an hour before it appears on the horizon, whereupon a swift ballet of machine and human movement begins. A siren blared as a gantry crane began to creep toward me through the mist. The three 41-ton cranes straddled six rail lines \u2014 three are the wide-gauge rails that stretch across the post-Soviet world from Helsinki to Ulaanbaatar; three are the standard gauge used in both China and Europe \u2014 and from my perspective they appeared to tower impossibly over the mountains around us. From a dangling control booth, a crane operator lowered containers onto their beds with dull-eyed expertise.\n[What the world\u2019s emptiest international airport says about China.]\nThe national railway company of Kazakhstan owns 51 percent of Khorgos Gateway. The remaining 49 percent is split between two Chinese state-owned companies. Khamzin viewed China\u2019s participation not as economic imperialism but as proof of the port\u2019s likelihood of success. The Chinese, he explained, \u201care the kind of people that if they saw no commercial opportunity, they wouldn\u2019t invest here.\u201d\nSuch arrangements are less one-sided in Kazakhstan than in some of the more debt-strapped B.R.I. countries, so it\u2019s very unlikely that what happened in Sri Lanka will happen here. But Chinese investments have in all likelihood muffled Kazakhstan\u2019s response to the crackdown in Xinjiang.\nEach train that arrives at Khorgos has to pass through the Chinese region, which is home to 24 million people, including more than 12 million Uighurs and about 1.5 million Kazakhs. Although political unrest has troubled the region for decades, including, in recent years, a spate of knife attacks and bombings by Uighur separatists, authorities in Xinjiang have responded with brutal asymmetry, rounding up hundreds of thousands of Uighurs alongside thousands of ethnic Kazakh and Kyrgyz residents in a sweeping internment drive the scope of which rivals Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Their \u201coffenses\u201d range from open displays of religious belief \u2014 wearing a beard, praying in public, owning a Quran or refusing to smoke or eat pork \u2014 to simply traveling with or even speaking to relatives abroad. For those not yet detained, Xinjiang has become a dystopian zone of extralegal checkpoints, patrols, GPS tracking and random home inspections.\nSome experts say the camps and other security measures are partly in reaction to the increased freight traffic across Xinjiang, much of which now comes through Khorgos Gateway. \u201cThe role of Xinjiang has changed greatly with the B.R.I.,\u201d Adrian Zenz, an academic expert on China\u2019s minority policy, told me. China\u2019s B.R.I. ambitions have transformed Xinjiang from a fringe territory into what party leaders call a \u201ccore region\u201d of development. That\u2019s why awareness of the camps among people in places like Kazakhstan was such an issue, Zenz said. \u201cIt has significant potential to cast a very negative light on the Belt and Road.\u201d\nAfter my tour of the dry port, I headed a mile down the road to Nurkent, a newly built town of low bungalows and apartment blocks. For all its symbolic importance, Khorgos Gateway is still a modest operation; if it were a United States seaport, its 2018 throughput would place it somewhere around the 26th-largest in the country, beneath the ports of Mobile, Ala.; Boston; and Gulfport, Miss. There are just 190 employees, which Khamzin said was close to capacity, and most of them live in Nurkent, alongside railroad workers, police officers, border guards, customs officials and other agents of the new frontier. Except for the cawing of crows nesting within an apartment building\u2019s crumbling gables, the town was silent. During a visit to the region in 2016, Nazarbayev predicted the population would grow and merge with Zharkent to form a large city, but this was hard to visualize. The site of a planned expansion was marked by a roundabout with a tiered silver gateway \u2014 the \u201c2001\u201d obelisk as imagined by Frank Gehry \u2014 through whose arch I could see only an untended field of scrubland.\nAs I stood looking at the archway, a car pulled up. A man in straw hat and sandals hoisted himself out of the passenger side. \u201cI guard this place,\u201d he said. He uncoiled a hose on the ground and began watering the grass around the gate. \u201cThis is the double door to the future of Nurkent, where the city will rise up.\u201d\nKhorgos\u2019s other major landmark is a boomtown of open borders known as the International Center for Boundary Cooperation, or I.C.B.C., which China and Kazakhstan established in 2011 about six miles from the dry port. Here it is not only the goods that move freely back and forth but also the people. In this duty- and visa-free zone, Kazakh citizens willing to brave the hourlong wait at customs control are permitted to enter a walled section of the Chinese side of Khorgos across the border to buy cheap linens and electronics, and Chinese tourists may enter a walled leisure area inside Kazakhstan to buy souvenirs and eat Kazakh delicacies like shashlik and laghman.\nA United Nations human rights panel describes the entirety of Xinjiang as a \u201cmassive internment camp,\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop workers I met at the dry port from suggesting I cross into China by way of the I.C.B.C. Khorgos Gateway and the I.C.B.C. are the products of special economic development zones set up in coordination with China: industrial and commercial arenas designed to foster jobs and investments. There are dozens of such zones within China \u2014 the first, Shenzhen, is now a megacity of more than 12 million people \u2014 but Khorgos is the first to exist partly outside China\u2019s own borders. That will soon change. Chinese officials have announced plans to build 50 more international zones in countries from Algeria to Vietnam.\nAt Khorgos, the I.C.B.C. seems intended to complement the dry port\u2019s vision of frictionless trade with an equivalent vision of borderless commerce, even if most Kazakhs understand the project as a wholesale depot for cheaply made Chinese goods. A popular hustle among shopkeepers from Almaty is to hire one of the locals who wait outside the I.C.B.C., and who are euphemistically called \u201ccarriers,\u201d to help circumvent the weight limits on imports. By all accounts, customs officials tend to look the other way.\nMy state-assigned guide picked me up at my hotel in Zharkent in a sleek Mercedes sedan that he drove as if we had just robbed a bank. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d he asked, laughing, as we careered around a watermelon truck. His name was Marat Abaiuly. If the I.C.B.C. was the most important of China\u2019s outposts in Kazakhstan, Abaiuly was its ambassador, the handsome liaison to opinion makers and potential investors. He made his power known by blowing through checkpoints with a friendly honk or, if necessary, by leaping out of the car to grip the soldier on duty by the forearm.\nIt was 10 in the morning, and a line of wholesalers and hopeful carriers had formed beyond a fence topped with concertina wire. Bus drivers reclined inside their open cargo holds, chain-smoking and preparing to nap through the day. Inside the customs-control building, a construction worker was destroying the tile floor with a jackhammer. Improvised lines formed around the rubble.\nChina is said to be spending billions of dollars building up its side of Khorgos. By contrast, Kazakhstan\u2019s share of the I.C.B.C. is mostly a dream of the future. Projects like a constellation of luxury hotels, a sports complex and a Disneyland-style theme park called Happy Land Khorgos have languished for lack of funding. Fields of rubble and stalled construction projects are scattered among the few small retail buildings and the yurt-shaped gift shops that are the Kazakh side\u2019s most distinctive feature.\nIn recent years, the name Khorgos has instead become synonymous among Kazakhs with smuggling rings and high-profile corruption cases. In 2011, authorities arrested the head of customs at Khorgos as part of a larger takedown of a $130 billion smuggling ring. In 2016, the former head of the I.C.B.C. was caught on tape accepting a $1 million bribe for a construction bid. Locals do not tend to figure in these public scandals, but based on the crowds I saw in front of the border checkpoint, informal gray-market carrying at Khorgos seems to have replaced animal husbandry as the region\u2019s main line of work. \u201cMost locals work at the I.C.B.C. carrying cargo,\u201d the chief executive of an Almaty-based truck transport company later told me, describing the work as a kind of pseudolegal smuggling. \u201cThat\u2019s how they make money.\u201d\nAbaiuly arranged for an I.C.B.C. van to drive us across the open border into China, where the main attractions for visiting Kazakhs are four large, windowless malls. The malls are honeycombed with shops where women of all ages and a few older men sell underwear, electronics and an array of other inexpensive products under fluorescent lights. One mall was dedicated entirely to fur coats, a gift of ritual significance in Kazakhstan, particularly between in-laws at weddings. It was early, and there were no customers anywhere. Floor after floor of identical shops stood empty, their racks of odorless pelts doubled and tripled by wall-length mirrors.\nSome workers I met were Chinese citizens from Xinjiang. I had heard that, in some towns, even talking to a journalist is considered grounds for detention, so I didn\u2019t say much, and I was relieved to come across an outspoken furrier from Kazakhstan, Zhannur Erkenkyzy, who had worked at the border for six months. She got the job because she could speak Chinese, Russian, Uighur and Kazakh. She was also the store\u2019s model, she said, and she showed me her Instagram page, on which she appeared nestled inside the furs of minks, foxes and beavers, although at the moment she was wearing no fur at all, just a black cocktail dress that reflected no light.\nErkenkyzy said she worked seven days a week unless she happened to ask for a day off. The time involved in crossing the unpredictable border meant that the job occupied most of her waking life, of which one highlight was catching thieves. \u201cWhen we see a shoplifter, we put on red armbands and beat them with sticks,\u201d she said excitedly. Abaiuly interrupted, whispering in low, snappy Russian: \u201cWhy are you saying such nasty stuff about us to the reporter?\u201d\nBack on the Kazakh side, we wandered the yurts, which were staffed by Chinese clerks who spoke no Russian or Kazakh. Tourists were milling about inside one of them, browsing rows of instant coffee, jade eggs and taxidermic hawks and antelopes. Outside, a row of golf carts and one stretch limousine waited to take the tourists back. I watched a group of women in ankle-length skirts cross a moonscape of rocks, heading toward China and dragging uselessly wheeled luggage behind them. When I asked Abaiuly about the prevalence of the carriers, he smiled. \u201cOn that subject I cannot speak,\u201d he said.\nAt an outdoor restaurant, I met a shashlik cook who lived inside one of the yurts where Chinese tourists ate. He left and re-entered the I.C.B.C. once a week to stay out of legal trouble, and said it was cheaper than living anywhere else.\nOne way to read the history of Central Asia is as a record of interactions between the mounted nomads who were long the primary occupants of the Eurasian Steppe and the sedentary populations who lived among them. As late as the 1930s, the dominant activity on the steppe was pastoral: herding sheep, goats and other livestock. Herders roamed in large, shifting clans on either side of the Tian Shan and Altai ranges, traveling on horseback and occasionally fragmenting or forming political alliances. These nomadic hordes proved unconquerable until the late 18th century, when they began to fall to Chinese conquest and, in what is now Kazakhstan, to Russian \u2014 later Soviet \u2014 rule.\nIn 1929, the leaders of the Soviet Union determined that Kazakhstan\u2019s pastoral work force would go to work on farms. This forced collectivization was framed as a civilizing mission to modernize a population whom many Russians had long viewed as primitive barbarians. Land formerly devoted to grazing was irrigated and turned over to wheat production, with the immediate result that around 90 percent of the country\u2019s livestock died. The subsequent famine caused the deaths of one-quarter of the population of Kazakhstan and anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all ethnic Kazakhs, a human-made catastrophe that ended nomadism as it had been practiced in the region for thousands of years. Kazakhs became a minority in the nation the Soviets had founded in their name.\nNomadic pastoralism remains central to Kazakh mythology \u2014 Nazarbayev describes himself as \u201cthe son, grandson and great-grandson of herders\u201d \u2014 but as a practice it has retreated to the periphery of the country\u2019s economy. Most of the surviving herders in this part of Kazakhstan practice a form of seminomadism known as transhumance, alternating between winters in a low-altitude village and summers in a pasture, or zhailau, in the mountains. I wondered how those in the mountains above Khorgos were reacting to the economic foment that had emerged around their winter homes. One morning I visited a village of herders in the Zhongar Alatau, a northern stretch of the Tian Shan named for the last nomadic khanate to rule over the steppes of western China.\nIt was Friday, and most of the men were at the village mosque. I asked the local damkeeper\u2019s son, who said his name was Turar, to take me farther into the mountains where families graze their herds throughout the summer. I got into Turar\u2019s old Lada four-wheel drive, and we rattled and bounced up the edge of a steep bank that commanded a wide prospect of sand dunes and crumpled foothills. Hawks gyred overhead. I thought to myself that the beauty of Kazakhstan defied description, but Turar, who had lived here all his life, managed to capture its pristine emptiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like a screen,\u201d he said cryptically. Then, to clarify: \u201cLike a computer. Like the Windows screen.\u201d\nTo reach the zhailau, we left Turar\u2019s car at the dam where his family controls the flow of snowmelt and mountain spring through a Soviet-era irrigation canal. Before long, we arrived at an emerald slope where a single yurt sat embosomed in alpine lushness. Turar said this area was called the Black Gorge.\nA friend of Turar\u2019s emerged from the yurt, blinking at the sun. His name was Arsen Akhatay, and he\u2019d been napping. Every spring, he helped drive the family livestock, a few hundred sheep and 50 cows and horses, up to the zhailau and tended them. He returned to the village when school started in the fall, leaving his parents to drive the animals back down. In between, there was a lot of free time. Sometimes he passed it playing kokpar, a popular Central Asian sport in which players fight over a headless goat carcass while on horseback. Akhatay was the attacker on his local team and was meant to be at training camp this week for nationals, but he\u2019d fallen sick instead. He surveyed his sheep without enthusiasm. Each was labeled in resin with a large \u201c5\u201d marking it as a member of his family\u2019s flock. A solar panel staked into the ground near the doorway to the yurt powered a Chinese-made radio and a four-inch TV set. Turar gestured farther into the gorge, where Akhatay\u2019s family pastured their horses a mile or so in, and said that if you kept on in that direction, you\u2019d hit China.\nAkhatay was wearing a blue camouflage jacket, the kind worn by Kazakh police officers on field exercises. His cousin came out of the yurt wearing the same thing. During the school year they lived in a village near Zharkent called Turpan. Akhatay, who was about to start his senior year of high school, said he did not intend to look after sheep his whole life. I asked whether he wanted a job at Khorgos.\n\u201cMany people from the village work at the border as carriers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many official jobs but also many unofficial.\u201d All things being equal, he said, he wanted an official one. When he graduated, he planned to enroll at the military institute in Almaty to become a border guard.\nOn our drive down the mountain there was nothing to displease the eye, and before long we arrived at yet another small mountain village of white birches and potato gardens. Turar parked the car by a water pump and introduced me to a former classmate, a Kazakh named Zholaman Tashimkhan, who had come out to greet us.\nWe sat on the curb near the pump. Like Arsen, Tashimkhan spent most of the summer up in the mountains, but he was older and had already been drawn to the jobs at the border. He worked for a year for the railroad, a good job that is hard to come by through normal channels \u2014 \u201cI used my connections,\u201d he said, and laughed \u2014 but then his sister\u2019s husband found him work as a carrier. \u201cIt\u2019s not an official job,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a public job.\u201d\nA few men from the village began to gather around the pump as we talked. Tashimkhan explained that he had worked for a wholesaler based in Zharkent, crossing into the I.C.B.C. four or five days a week to bring household products, mostly bedsheets and linens, back into Kazakhstan. He was paid according to how much he managed to get through customs. On an average day, he might earn $15 or $20 \u2014 good money \u2014 and occasionally as much as $60. Customs enforcement was lax. \u201cFor us, you talk to the official working there, and you just bring things out,\u201d he said.\nMore villagers had come out to the road until they completed a circle around us. Tashimkhan changed the subject, then joked with a friend that he was starting to think he would regret talking to me. An older man who had been pacing the street squatted down beside us and began conspicuously sharpening a sickle a few inches from my head. Turar suggested it was time for us to continue down the mountain. We got into the Lada and drove off.\nThe great commonplace of our time also happens to be true: The world is more connected than ever before. But if it is more connected, the world is also more administered \u2014 its people more coerced and surveilled, more susceptible to the designs of authoritarian leaders and more dependent on the fortunes of mercurial international markets \u2014 than at any point in human history. If the first fact has made some parts of the world freer, the second has made the rest of it less so.\nA continuing trial at the local courthouse in Zharkent underscored this inversion, which seemed to me to lie at the heart of the developments at Khorgos. The case concerned Sayragul Sauytbay, a Chinese-born Kazakh woman who had fled Xinjiang and was requesting political asylum in Kazakhstan. Before the crackdown in Xinjiang, ethnic Kazakhs freely crossed the border to visit friends and relatives. But in 2016, as crossings became increasingly fraught, Sauytbay\u2019s husband and two children decided to move permanently to Kazakhstan. Sauytbay, who was working in Xinjiang as a kindergarten director, remained in China with plans to join them; the rest of the family became Kazakh citizens in 2017. For more than a year, they met only in the free-trade zone at the I.C.B.C.\nOn April 5, 2018, without telling anyone, Sauytbay entered the I.C.B.C. with forged identity papers, then slipped into Kazakhstan by posing as a member of a tour group. A few weeks later, she was arrested and charged with entering the country illegally, and then her story began to emerge. Not long after her family had left China, Sauytbay was assigned to work at one of Xinjiang\u2019s notorious detention camps. In her testimony, she described it as \u201ca prison in the mountains,\u201d with high walls and barbed wire that kept in some 2,500 inmates. She said she was forced by authorities to accept a teaching job there, indoctrinating the inmates in state propaganda, and she was warned that the penalty for revealing any information about the camps was death. The authorities confiscated her passport.\nAt her trial, Sauytbay provided some of the earliest testimony about life in Xinjiang\u2019s camps. Her case made headlines in Kazakhstan\u2019s national newspapers. She was married to a Kazakh citizen and was herself a \u201creturnee,\u201d a member of the diaspora of ethnic Kazakhs the government has been courting for years. But now prosecutors at Sauytbay\u2019s trial were arguing that she should be deported back to China, where she claimed she would be arrested or even killed for having made public her knowledge of the camps.\nMost people I\u2019d met in Almaty seemed to think she had little chance of receiving asylum, much less Kazakh citizenship. The acquittal rate in criminal trials in Kazakhstan is around 1 percent, and hasn\u2019t changed since the days of the Soviet Union. There was also the B.R.I. to consider. Kazakhstan might decide Chinese investment was more important than any international agreements on refugees. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a country was so swayed. In 2017, Greece vetoed a European Union statement criticizing China\u2019s human rights record at the United Nations, a decision that critics linked to China\u2019s controlling interest not just in Greece\u2019s largest port but also in its public power grid. In January, China hosted a Silk Road Celebrity China Tour, inviting journalists from six B.R.I. partner countries \u2014 Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2014 on a highly choreographed tour of a \u201cvocational center\u201d in Kashgar, another famous stop on the ancient Silk Road. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, the visitors uniformly \u201cpraised the development and stability\u201d of Xinjiang. An editor from Bangladesh singled out the region\u2019s contributions \u201cto the nonoccurrence of violence and terrorism.\u201d\nMy last day in town coincided with what turned out to be the last day of Sauytbay\u2019s trial. About 100 supporters had risen early and driven out from Almaty to the courthouse, which was opposite a park where marble busts of Soviet heroes watched over a playground. When the courtroom opened, the crowd crushed against the glass doors. I made it through with a handful of other reporters thanks to some strategic shoving by a few veteran activists; most of the crowd remained on the courthouse steps.\nAs the proceedings began, Sauytbay\u2019s lawyer introduced into evidence a copy of the asylum application that she had just filed. Both the judge and prosecutor interrogated Sauytbay, who from behind a clear protective wall related how, when she was arrested by the Kazakh police, an official told her that she would be sent back to China to die and her children would become orphans.\nSauytbay freely admitted she\u2019d escaped China illegally. She was willing to serve a prison sentence. She just didn\u2019t want to be sent back. \u201cThere is no reason for me to live if I am not with my children,\u201d she told the judge. Her family sat across the room, near an open window through which we could hear the crowd murmuring outside.\nThe prosecution had previously rejected any kind of a plea deal. So what happened next was that rare thing: a dramatic courtroom reversal. In a closing statement, the prosecutor cited the outpouring of support the case had received across Kazakhstan. She requested that the judge allow Sauytbay to serve out a period of probation at her husband\u2019s house. \u201cI ask you not to apply deportation,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask you to set her free in the courtroom.\u201d Sauytbay\u2019s eyes went wide. Her lawyer, who seemed stunned, agreed. A few moments later, sounds of cheering rang out on the courthouse steps.\n\u201cI was surprised the law was kept,\u201d Rysbek Sarsenbay, a prominent opposition activist, told me later. He reasoned that the government must have weighed the consequences of deporting Sauytbay carefully against the risk of alienating China\u2019s leadership. \u201cEven as a dictatorship,\u201d he said, \u201cKazakhstan must honor its international commitments.\u201d\nOnce the judge issued the expected ruling \u2014 prosecutors and judges in Kazakhstan rarely disagree \u2014 Sauytbay was ushered from the courthouse to the top of the steps, where she embraced her son and thanked President Nazarbayev for his beneficence. A poet took the stage to extemporize a victory verse in Kazakh. The crowd repaired to a restaurant a few miles outside Zharkent, where a spontaneous release party began with the singing of the national anthem. Waiters descended with plates of beshbarmak, a national dish of boiled noodles and horse meat in onion sauce. When Sauytbay arrived, holding her son in her arms, everyone stood up and clapped. She told me she hoped her testimony would \u201cshine a light of hope\u201d for her compatriots in China. \u201cThey know there is a country that will always protect them,\u201d she said.\nThe celebration may have been premature. As Sauytbay later told The Globe and Mail of Toronto, within a day of her release, her sister and two friends were arrested in Xinjiang \u2014 they have since disappeared into camps \u2014 and in October Kazakhstan denied Sauytbay\u2019s asylum claim. For the time being, she is living at home with her family, but her legal status in Kazakhstan is uncertain.\nEven if she manages to avoid deportation, Sauytbay is one of thousands of people with ties to Kazakhstan who have found themselves caught up in Xinjiang\u2019s detention centers. At the release party, I found myself sitting next to a Kazakh woman named Qarlyghash Ziparova, whose nephew, a former Xinjiang official named Askar Azatbek, had disappeared inside the ostensibly neutral free trade zone of the I.C.B.C. Azatbek, who had become a Kazakh citizen a few months earlier, entered the I.C.B.C. in 2017 with a friend, whereupon a group of men drove up in two cars and detained them. The friend was released, but Azatbek was hauled off. They hadn\u2019t even been on the Chinese side, the friend had said. Ziparova tried to complain to authorities in Kazakhstan, but without any luck. The I.C.B.C. told her there was no surveillance video, although she didn\u2019t believe it. She didn\u2019t understand how a Kazakh citizen could be taken away by China like that \u2014 without even a trial.\nThe ancient Silk Road was equal parts trade route and social network. The routes themselves were in constant flux and administered by no one, and they succeeded through incremental growth and local knowledge in response to changing needs \u2014 the exact opposite of the Ozymandian ambitions and sweeping autocratic statecraft that characterize the Belt and Road. For all its potential to create jobs and modernize infrastructures, the project has also created a halo of mass internment camps for the powerless and gray-market economies for the poor. While new official jobs in Khorgos are lifting a lucky few out of poverty, it is far more common to find farmers and herders moonlighting as taxi drivers, security guards or smugglers, part of a precarious network of low-paid freelancers. Such work is susceptible by design to sudden changes in enforcement and depends on a constant influx of disposable workers. It seemed like a high cost for connecting the world.\nI hired a taxi to drive me back to Almaty. We took a new highway that opened last year, part of a growing highway system affiliated with the B.R.I. and known as the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor. The highway cuts the travel time in half, from six hours to just over three hours, and driving atop it felt like riding an air-hockey puck. There were no rest stops or gas stations, and the few landmarks I could see stood at an unobtrusive distance. They included an old train station, a pumping house for a Chinese oil pipeline and the alien forms of a half-built wind farm courtesy of SANY Group, the Chinese manufacturing behemoth. As the sun became a narrow red eye on the horizon, a dust storm descended the cliffs to our left and crossed the road into empty veld. There were no cars in sight. It was less a road than the idea of a road.\nThe driver didn\u2019t know anything about the trial whose outcome I had just seen. He had never heard of Sayragul Sauytbay. He was happy to have such a fine new highway on which to drive his customers back and forth between Khorgos and Almaty. Kazakhstan, we agreed, was a beautiful country. He pointed to some fields he said would be full of cattle in the fall, then opened the sunroof and stuck his hand into the night air.\nThis article was researched with support from New York University\u2019s Matthew Power Literary Reporting Award.\nBen Mauk is a writer based in Berlin.

The novelist, Salman Rushdie, author of ''The Satanic Verses,'' said he was taking the threat seriously.\nThe Teheran radio quoted Ayatollah Khomeini as asking ''all the Muslims to execute them,'' referring to Mr. Rushdie, who lives in London, and the publishers of the book, Viking Penguin, ''wherever they find them.''\nHe said that anyone killed carrying out his order would be considered a martyr.\nMr. Rushdie's American agent said there were no plans to call off the author's American promotional tour. All was quiet at Viking Penguin's offices in New York, but a guard there said security was tight.\nThreat Taken 'Very Seriously'\nWednesday was declared a day of mourning in Iran to protest the novel. It has prompted violent protests by Islamic fundamentalists over the author's projection of Islamic myths and Koranic motifs in contemporary and futuristic settings, which many\ncontend is blasphemous.\n''The author of the 'Satanic Verses' book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death,'' said Ayatollah Khomeini, whose\nword is considered law by millions of Shiite Muslims. ''If someone knows them but is unable to kill them, he should hand them over to the people for punishment.''\nMr. Rushdie, who is 41 years old and was born into a Kashmiri Muslim family in Bombay, could not be reached by The New York Times for comment today. But he was quoted as telling the British Broadcasting Corporation that he had to take the threat ''very\nseriously indeed'' and that he ''may well have to think about'' applying to the authorities for protection.\n''I am very sad it should have happened,'' Mr. Rushdie was quoted by the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, as saying. ''It is not true this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much Khomeini\nor anyone else in Iran has read the book or anything more than selected extracts taken out of context.''\nBritain's Foreign Office said today that clarification was being sought over Ayatollah Khomeini's remarks, which, ''if true, are a cause for concern.'' [ A leader of the British Muslims, quoted by Reuters, added grave concern\nto the security situation late tonight by reinforcing Ayatollah Khomeini's call for Mr. Rushdie's execution. Said Abdul Quddas, joint secretary of the Council of Mosques in the northern English city of Bradford,\ntold reporters, ''Every good Muslim is after his life. He has tortured Islam and has to pay the penalty. He deserves hanging. [ ''There are any number of people who would willingly carry out what to\nus would not be a crime but a justified act.'' ] A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to comment on the threat. However, British newspapers said the Special Branch of Scotland Yard was protecting Mr. Rushdie,\nadding that a team of armed officers was probably assigned to accompany the author. Special Branch officers will also increase surveillance on Muslim fundamentalist groups in London and throughout Britain, the agency said.\nThe Khomeini statement came amid a wave of protests and attempts to ban the book. On Sunday, a mob of thousands of enraged Muslims tried to enter and destroy the American cultural center in Islamabad, Pakistan, because Mr. Rushdie's book is being\npublished in the United States. The attack left five people dead and more than 100 people wounded; three people died in similar disturbances in India on Monday.\nMuslims in Britain burned copies of the book last month and W. H. Smith booksellers withdrew it from public display in Bradford, a city in the north that has a large Moslem community.\nThe Press Association quoted Mr. Rushdie's literary agent in Britain, Gillon Aitken, as saying that the author had been ''out and about,'' in response to a question about whether he was in hiding today.\n''I assume he has been getting on with his life,'' Mr. Aitken said.\n''The Satanic Verses'' begins with a plane crash over the English Channel in which two men survive to be ''born again,'' one with a halo, the other with slowly developing horns and hoofs. It is not clear, despite\ntheir appearance, which of them is good and which is evil. They become involved with characters named Alleluia Cone and Mahound, the latter a businessman turned prophet who lives in the imaginary city of Jahilla.\n'A Dirty Conspiracy'\nMr. Rushdie's character the Prophet Mahound resembles the portrayal of Jesus Christ in Martin Scorsese's film ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' in that Mahound is depicted as having a human nature and wrestling with temptation.\nThe work is clearly perceived as offensive to Islam, but what exactly is regarded as insulting has not been spelled out.\nThe Iranian Government condemned the book as ''a dirty conspiracy'' against Islam and urged followers of Ayatollah Khomeini around the world to take action against it. A Government statement read on the Teheran radio called for cells\nof the Party of God -devotees of the Ayatollah and a group of them in Lebanon is believed to be holding Westerners who are missing and believed kidnapped there - to take ''necessary steps to neutralize this plot.''\n''We call on all Party of God cells in the world of Islam to grasp the depth of this black conspiracy,'' the statement said. ''We advise all Islamic Governments not to place themselves against the million masses of angry\nMuslims but to demonstrate their disgust and anger, together with their nation, towards this provocative American deed.''\nThe Iranian press agency quoted Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi as calling Mr. Rushdie an ''American mercenary.''\nMr. Rushdie was quoted as telling Independent Television News here that he doubted that those conducting a campaign against the book were trying to act as ''thought police.''\nReturn to the Books Home Page", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-khomeini.html?module=inline", "tags": [{"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.93711"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.86777"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.78638"}, {"label": "book trade", "score": "0.24655"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.09604"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.08341"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.07789"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.06820"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.06216"}, {"label": "threats and threatening messages", "score": "0.05216"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.04171"}, {"label": "censorship", "score": "0.04073"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.03329"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.03319"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.03318"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.03223"}, {"label": "christians and christianity", "score": "0.02848"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.02744"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02591"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.02564"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01906"}, {"label": "fringe groups and movements", "score": "0.01575"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01550"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.01441"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.01434"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01412"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01370"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01248"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.01139"}, {"label": "anti-semitism", "score": "0.01135"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Iran", "Teheran", "London", "New York", "Iran", "Bombay", "Britain", "Iran", "Britain", "Bradford", "London", "Britain", "Islamabad", "Pakistan", "the United States", "India", "Britain", "Bradford", "Britain", "Teheran", "Lebanon"], "ORG": ["ONDON", "Islam", "Islam", "The New York Times", "the British Broadcasting Corporation", "the Press Association", "Islam", "Foreign Office", "Reuters", "the Council of Mosques", "Islam", "Scotland Yard", "the Special Branch of Scotland Yard", "Special Branch", "The Press Association", "the English Channel", "Mahound", "Mahound", "Islam", "The Iranian Government", "Islam", "the Party of God", "Party", "Independent Television News"], "PERSON": ["Khomeini", "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini", "Salman Rushdie", "Ayatollah Khomeini", "Rushdie", "Rushdie", "Ayatollah Khomeini", "Rushdie", "Rushdie", "Khomeini", "Ayatollah Khomeini's", "Ayatollah Khomeini's", "Rushdie", "Said Abdul Quddas", "Rushdie", "Khomeini", "Rushdie", "W.

The output would be a WeWork. So much serene, lavish and mechanical attention is allocated to every detail: the neon and the daybeds and the fiddle-leaf figs, the wallpaper and the playlists and the typefaces. The newest iteration of its ever-emergent design concept may be indebted to Luis Barrag\u00e1n and Carlo Scarpa, but the degree of thought and investment that goes into its terrarium construction is something its busy occupants are expected to register only as background noise. WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.\nThere\u2019s also free top-shelf coffee, the sort of minor frill most office workers might take for granted in a way the self-employed never would. One premise of the company\u2019s existence is that it\u2019s good business to provide such minor luxuries to the otherwise unfrilled. The coffee \u2014 and the draft kombucha, which has come to supplement beer as WeWork distances itself from the frattier aspects of entrepreneurship \u2014 is, at any rate, only part of an environment engineered for felicitous exchange. This strategy is supported by narrow hallways, boxy plate-glass enclosures, distant bathrooms and centralized fruit-water dispensers, but the company\u2019s architects never indulged the belief that if they built it, people would come. The spaces themselves are the staging ground for yoga classes, wine tastings, make-your-own-trail-mix bars and vendor workshops about how to cut cloud costs. For what remains of life outside the workplace, there are cross-promotional discounts on 1-800-Flowers.com and Crunch gym memberships.\nMost of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work, and it\u2019s easy to object to WeWork\u2019s thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle. Once you get accustomed to the basic product, however, it\u2019s hard not to find it ... pretty nice. Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.\n[Housecleaners, nannies, health aides and domestic workers are organizing to secure job security. Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue.]\nMy \u201chome\u201d location \u2014 on North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, next to the Whole Foods across from the Apple store \u2014 was proposed to me, by WeWork\u2019s unusually thoughtful and candid public-relations representatives, as a particularly strong example of the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity layer\u201d at work. The \u201ccommunity manager,\u201d Natalie, is a luminous young woman with flaming scarlet hair and a rockabilly swagger. She started as the location\u2019s first front-desk associate and rose quickly to her current role as operational czar, personal concierge and on-call therapist; she has also been recruited, in her capacity as a \u201ctheatrical jazz pop\u201d singer, to perform at companywide events. She has first-name-basis relationships with everybody. She knows when the printer by the sunglasses and accessories manufacturer is going to run out, and when Ulrik, the chief executive of the Danish software-platform company that is the location\u2019s largest tenant, is arriving on a red-eye and will require early-hours access. She was quick to put together canned-food and used-clothing drives on the occasions of disasters, and encouraged everyone to sign up for a marrow-donor registry. Community managers remember people\u2019s birthdays and their preferences in candy or whiskey and their dogs\u2019 preferences in treats.\nWeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.\nIf Natalie was everyone\u2019s favorite quasi comptroller, it was clear that everyone\u2019s favorite quasi co-worker was a young accountant named Mabel Luna. When she was 18, Mabel moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx. She put herself through school and worked for three of the Big Four accounting firms until she decided her heart was not in capital markets but in small companies. It was the idea of her own office, which she selected before the space had a floor, that gave her the confidence to start a business \u2014 a common sentiment at WeWork and one I heard particularly often from women and people of color \u2014 and on move-in day, she hung up her shingle as a private C.P.A. Though she never advertised, she quickly outgrew herself; she told me that 90 percent of her customers have come through WeWork, either via hallway run-ins or through the social-networking features of its mobile app. She had several clients in the building \u2014 including a brewer of natural alcoholic kombucha, a sole-proprietor attorney and the German sunglasses manufacturer by the printer \u2014 and saw herself as much more than an arm\u2019s-length contractor. The only real glitch was that her friend-client-colleagues were constantly stopping by to rap on her window with a quick question about cash flow or depreciation, or to ask if she could spare an hour for a kombucha-tasting panel or some volunteer hand-modeling. During tax season, she felt as though she had to leave WeWork to get any work done.\nThe relentless sociability inspired by WeWork was always one of the founders\u2019 aims, even as the composition of its membership has changed. When the company first opened in 2010, its spaces catered to entrepreneurs. The founders soon understood that the increasingly fluid and anxious labor market \u2014 its conditions exacerbated by the downturn but likely to exist in perpetuity \u2014 presented them with a much larger potential customer base. Uber and TaskRabbit and other labor-platform intermediaries positioned themselves to match those who needed something done with those who needed something to do, but they based their recruitment drives on a cynical reading of the economic mood. The subway I took to WeWork was plastered with tough-love ads from services like Fiverr, which made naked appeals to stoic virtues. (\u201cActually, it hasn\u2019t all been done before\u201d; \u201cIn doers we trust\u201d; \u201cReading about starting your own business is like reading about having sex.\u201d)\nThat sort of campaign felt manipulative: The platforms\u2019 emphasis on self-reliance for the economically precarious merely disguised their rent-seeking. WeWork, by contrast, just charged rent. The company was perceptive enough to realize that disaggregated workers (or at least those of a certain class) did not want to hear that they should just kill it on their own, bro. They wanted to hear that nobody ever can. What WeWork offered was not just rhetoric \u2014 a more sympathetic description of the restless, fretful life of the deinstitutionalized worker \u2014 but true shelter from a pervasive sense of alienation. Where Fiverr issued an invitation to gladiatorial combat, WeWork promised a work environment remodeled for solace and dignity.\nThus is the business model of WeWork, recently valued at $47 billion, now only facially about commercial subletting. All its accessories serve to buttress its real product: \u201coffice culture\u201d as a service. When people at the company try to explain that culture, they invariably resort to talk of positive energy sources and the obligation to heal the social fabric \u2014 a vocabulary traditionally associated with utopian architecture, 1980s academic communitarianism or ayahuasca experimentation. They affirm that all the ostensibly small incremental niceties add up to more than the sum of their parts, and on some level I couldn\u2019t help agreeing. The market certainly seems to. As of this January, WeWork has 400,000 members in 425 locations in 27 countries, at least 30 percent of whom are employees of large existing businesses. This latter category has helped double that membership in only a year. Some of these enterprise customers are merely outsourcing their facilities management the way they outsource manufacturing or payroll; others anticipate the revitalization \u2014 or even wholesale procurement \u2014 of their corporate culture. The conviction behind the rapid growth of WeWork is that the office culture of the future is likely to be the culture of the future, full stop, and that it is WeWork\u2019s special vocation to bring it to market.\nThe idea of \u201ccorporate culture,\u201d long before it was identified and cultivated as such, emerged as a solution to the problems of the large, distributed mass-industrial firm. Ransom Olds is credited with inventing the concept of the assembly line in 1901, and it was over the following decades that businesses began to feel an imperative to address the question of what work was supposed to \u201cmean.\u201d This was both an internal bottom-line matter \u2014 employees who toiled in exchange for only a paycheck were difficult to retain and unlikely to prioritize efficiency or innovation \u2014 and a social one. By midcentury, large companies like the car manufacturers had come to represent the predominant institutional affiliation for legions of American men. Even if these firms had no explicit philanthropic interest in civic cohesion, they certainly had a stake in the preservation of the social order. If they could invest piecemeal labor with something like dignity, they could neutralize the political and economic threats posed by union solidarity.\nWhat they arrived at was a generic set of strategies, applicable at any industrial organization, designed to help workers recognize the value of their personal contributions to the final product. The classic formulation of this approach was Peter Drucker\u2019s \u201cConcept of the Corporation\u201d; though it\u2019s now seen \u2014 if not much read \u2014 as a foundational text in the study of management, it reads like a sober contribution to midcentury sociology. The simplest form of recognition is advancement. Workers, Drucker believed, ought to be viewed not as exploitable resources but as human capital to be fostered, and thus provided with the training necessary to secure a path upward. Programs like project rotations \u2014 which exposed otherwise specialized employees to the breadth of company operations \u2014 should be put in place even if they seemed, in the short term, economically irrational; in the long term, they represented an investment in worker potential. Employees unlikely to advance might more gladly accept their place in the corporate scheme when given a holistic perspective on production: The maker of a car\u2019s door hinge, for example, might be shown where his discrete, repetitive effort fits into the fully realized car.\nThe anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined culture as a collective act of interpretation, the stories we tell one another about ourselves in an attempt to make ongoing sense of why we do what we do. A car manufacturer could just point to a sensible Oldsmobile, something the world self-evidently needed. Because cars were public goods, corporate culture could easily borrow its energy from civic culture.\nIt could also borrow civic culture\u2019s prevailing norms \u2014 and, in turn, reinforce them. The management classic \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d describes how Walt Disney, for example, did not manage a corporation so much as lord over an extended brood of subordinates, each of them expected not only to abide by the letter of company decorum but also to embody its founder\u2019s spirit. Hourly theme-park workers were held to an imperious standard of personal upkeep: for men, no facial hair; for women, no dangly earrings or excessive makeup. As one biographer described it, \u201cWhen someone did, on occasion, slip in Walt\u2019s presence and use a four-letter word in mixed company, the result was always immediate dismissal, no matter what type of professional inconvenience the firing caused.\u201d The people making the country\u2019s cars could be forgiven a coarse exclamation; the people making the country\u2019s cartoons were held to a loftier code.\nAs the economy shifted from industrial manufacturing to the service and knowledge sectors, it became increasingly necessary for businesses to articulate their \u201ccore purpose\u201d as an organizational and motivational principle \u2014 and a way to differentiate \u201ctheir\u201d ethereal knowledge work from whatever it was other companies\u2019 employees did. The separation of corporate culture in particular from general civic culture was also encouraged by the ascendancy of free-market economics; Milton Friedman told executives that their sole remit was to tend to their own shareholder garden. Shared goals, while important, ought to be strictly values-agnostic.\nAn intrinsic and well-elaborated corporate mission was seen as a crucial competitive advantage. \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d examined, as a comparative case study, cultural differences in the tobacco sector. As the authors put it, \u201cwe saw in Philip Morris an esprit de corps and sense of common purpose that we simply did not see over the last 30 years at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives have appeared far more passionate about their cigarettes than the executives at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives express much more defiance in their prosmoking ideology, whereas the R.J.R. folks after about 1960 did not seem to care much about the products except as a way to make money. ... The Philip Morris executives, in contrast, framed the fight over cigarettes in almost self-righteous moral overtones: We have a right to smoke; it\u2019s a matter of freedom of choice. Don\u2019t take away our cigarettes. Don\u2019t tread on me!\u201d One former employee told them that \u201cthe company forced upon her and her co-workers boxes of cigarettes to take home with their paychecks.\u201d\nImplicit in all this was the acknowledgment that corporate work was not a clear-cut transaction but a complicated relationship. The difference between a contractor and an employee was that the employee accepted the benefits of security and attention along with the costs of unspecified professional obligations \u2014 the sum of which could be called culture. This paternalistic ethos in mainstream corporate America has long seemed aesthetically dour, economically inefficient and morally retrograde. \u201cCorporate culture\u201d today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities. Given the structure of our current economy, most companies understand that it\u2019s in the best interests of the shareholders to call it even: They\u2019ve withdrawn the Disney-like benefits as well as the Disney-like expectations and set their employees \u201cfree.\u201d\nWeWork has stepped into this breach, purporting to offer the best of both worlds. On the one hand, it speaks the language of autonomy: You can choose to sit at a table or a booth or a couch, you can come and go as you please, and if you rent an actual office, you can decorate it like a tiki bar or a nuclear submarine if you fancy it. On the other, however, it speaks the language of belonging, awarding freelancers like me the chance to go to office holiday parties, to feel as if our lives have been enlivened by the scuttlebutt around the ambiently professional boathouse. With a stable corporate culture, especially in a unionized shop, these two wants aren\u2019t contradictory: Solidarity among colleagues can give strength and definition to any individual employee\u2019s sense of independence. But in the floating economy that WeWork equips, there\u2019s something uneasy about the company\u2019s \u00e0 la carte promises.\n'Corporate culture' today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities.\nThe primary evidence for WeWork\u2019s faith in its own corporate calling \u2014 to be the universal purveyor of energy and community \u2014 is internal. The two big collective imprinting events on the company calendar each year are Summer Camp, a tent revival, and a wintertime Summit, a three-day carnival for thousands of employees. In January last year, the event took place in a cavernous theater underneath Madison Square Garden. The ratio of M.S.G. employees to WeWork attendees seemed to be approximately one to one, and the two groups faced off with a kind of looking-glass symmetry: on the one side, union sweatshirts and jackets for the electricians and security guards, and on the other, young people in \u201cWomen of WeWork\u201d or \u201cWe of Color\u201d or \u201cEast Region\u201d or \u201cCreated in China\u201d team T-shirts and sturdy outerwear over the standard-issue gray-heather CREATOR undershirts. The assembled WeWorkforce \u2014 which is, for a tech company, exceptionally diverse, gender-balanced and bizarrely attractive \u2014 had a relaxed cool that clashed with the atmosphere of corporate sentimentality. In the background, an inspirational video invited attendees to imagine \u201csomething that\u2019s greater than any one of us.\u201d Everyone present was \u201cpart of a new generation \u2014 the \u2018We\u2019 generation.\u201d\nOn the first full day of internal talks, Miguel McKelvey, a founder of the company and its chief culture officer, took the stage in a purple-heather \u201cWe of Color\u201d T-shirt. A keystone of company lore is that he grew up in a matriarchal collective in Oregon. (The other founder, Adam Neumann, grew up in part on a kibbutz; today, according to recent reports, he collects millions of dollars from WeWork as one of its landlords.) McKelvey explained that thus far the company had been associated with \u201centrepreneurs, start-ups, freelancers, and that\u2019s who we typically think of as the innovative people in our world.\u201d This was a characteristic WeWork sleight of hand, insofar as he was referring both to the employees present and to the current well of members; the company has a classic \u201cI\u2019m not just the president \u2014 I\u2019m also a member\u201d mentality. Over the last few years, he went on, \u201clarger companies thought: WeWork seems cool. We should put our teams into WeWork locations.\u201d\nThis was all prelude to McKelvey\u2019s announcement that the company was radically expanding its courtship of enterprise customers \u2014 offering a suite of \u201cspace as a service\u201d options under the new rubric Powered by We. WeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork. Some companies, like Liberty Mutual (Boston) and Nasdaq (New York), have simply taken a floor or two in a WeWork location. Others, like IBM (New York), have moved into entire buildings. WeWork\u2019s most enthusiastic customers \u2014 UBS (Weehawken, N.J.) and Sprint (Kansas City) are two of the biggest examples \u2014 have engaged the company\u2019s bespoke services from planning through build-out to management.\nVeresh Sita, an executive in charge of this novel product line, appeared onstage and asked us to close our eyes and \u201cimagine a workplace \u2014 imagine a workplace where you can create a life; imagine a workplace that\u2019s so much more than an office, desks and infrastructure; imagine a workplace built on your needs \u2014 physically and digitally.\u201d When we opened our eyes, he reminded us that most people did not have that privilege. \u201cEighty-five percent of employees at enterprise businesses do not feel engaged today.\u201d\nThe screen behind him flashed a beige sea of barren cubicles. \u201cFifty-one percent of employees at enterprise companies are currently looking for a job.\u201d What these companies needed was a better \u201cworkplace experience.\u201d Sita showed before-and-after slides of one firm\u2019s transformation. The first showed a collection of yellowing chairs scattered desolately around white laminate cafeteria tables; the second showed what we were to understand as the same space reborn as an open loft, with gales of natural light reflecting off the herringbone parquet and the emerald shoots of their ubiquitous succulents. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you even call the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cDeath row?\u201d\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, WeWork\u2019s pivot to culture has been a business necessity. The company takes out large commercial leases \u2014 initially entire floors, later buildings \u2014 and subdivides the floor plans into \u201cstorefront\u201d units with the size and flexibility designed to suit start-ups. As plenty of discriminating observers have pointed out, this business model is vulnerable to some huge macroeconomic risks: On the \u201csupply\u201d side of commercial leases, the company has little control over costs, while on the \u201cdemand\u201d side, its (highly elastic) product risks feeling like an easily duplicated commodity. And so, from the perspective of both investors and customers, it\u2019s paramount that WeWork not be seen as purely a real estate arbitrageur. The focus on \u201cculture\u201d affords it a kind of magical penumbra of workplace retrofuturism.\nIf the company\u2019s \u201cCultureOS\u201d excuses it from the harsh realities of commercial real estate, it also affords it an opportunity to differentiate its product from the \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d of the pure technology companies. It has collected an enormous amount of workplace data and has developed experimental desks that will feature personalized height and temperature settings, all of which could easily be exploited by productivity-hawk employers, but much of its CultureOS is oriented to \u201cwork-life balance.\u201d This could be flexibly interpreted. The Summit events included a panel with two community managers at enterprise locations. One was told by a client company never to plan events on Fridays, because people just didn\u2019t come in that day. But the community manager and her team went ahead and scheduled the sort of social calendar they were used to, and, she said, \u201clast Friday at 6:30 p.m., there were people playing Jenga and drinking beer.\u201d People who would usually leave at 3 or 4 were staying later than they ever had. Remote employees were now coming in every day; one was suddenly around so much that he was asked if he\u2019d relocated from the suburbs to the city, but the answer was no. \u201cEven if I have to commute every day for five hours,\u201d he apparently continued, \u201cI want to be here.\u201d\nThe community manager was confident that something as casual as weekly happy hours had been revolutionary to their new clients. \u201cExecutives who would otherwise be hiding out in private offices are now being peer-pressured to come out and hang with their direct reports. We are destroying hierarchy.\u201d\nWhen I met McKelvey a few weeks later at WeWork\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, he made it clear that the long-term plan was not just to make IBM a bit more like Google but something much more grandiose. The company\u2019s CultureOS was about being \u201csupportive to openness and conversation\u201d and the \u201cobligation we create to each other to be good humans to each other \u2014 to share a smile and some warmth.\u201d We\u2019ve learned the hard way from social media, he said, that \u201calignment along ideological lines is a shallow way of creating a human environment.\u201d This, McKelvey said, is what he tells his team: \u201cYou\u2019re not building work space. You\u2019re here building a new infrastructure to rebuild social fabric and rebuild up the potential for human connection.\u201d It was, he conceded, a \u201cbig leap.\u201d But the company existed to give it a shot. \u201cWho am I going to need in a disaster? The person I took a yoga class with versus the person I\u2019m in the same Facebook group with?\u201d The enterprise product could scale up that social infrastructure to unite millions and millions of people. On a hard-hat tour of WeWork\u2019s new West Coast headquarters, in San Francisco\u2019s Salesforce Tower, Adam Neumann told me: \u201cAssuming we keep up our personal growth as a company, as individuals and as a company, there is no limit. Businesses, neighborhoods, cities \u2014 there are new cities being built around the world, and we want the call from those cities.\u201d\nWeWork is not so na\u00efve as to think that narrow hallways, happy hours, Taco Tuesdays and yoga are going to revive the workplace as a locus of societal coherence. But it thinks that thousands of Natalies remembering the birthdays of thousands of Mabel Lunas might, and it\u2019s to its sincere credit that \u2014 unlike most other technology companies, but like most religions \u2014 it recognizes that meaning at scale is a high-touch business, and it seems prepared to invest in labor costs that, even if they\u2019re drawn from the low-wage hospitality sector, will grow linearly with expansion. When I spoke to representatives of Powered by We customers, they were highly appreciative of a partnership that gave their employees at the very least better access to informal common spaces.\nAnd WeWork is right to perceive that it provides its members with a heightened sense of social organization. To join WeWork is to feel gently buoyed along in a strange kind of substrate, neither fully adrift nor fully anchored, loosely bound to others by novel waveforms. These ties alternately resemble deals between independent contractors, collaborations between colleagues, flirtations between strangers and intimacy between friends \u2014 and insofar as they muddy the boundaries between these things, they ultimately feel like none of them. There is a near-imaginable WeWorld in which all human endeavor outsources itself to associations of WeNodes that in an eternal churn arise as spontaneously as they disperse. If a very clever combination of architecture, technology and hospitality serves as an analgesic for the disaggregated, it can just as easily function as a solvent for the institutions that remain.\nThis might not be such a bad thing, especially for certain types of \u201ccreatives\u201d and \u201cinnovators,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to see where community will take root and culture will flower. WeWork\u2019s executives might believe that people are lonely and atomized because our social infrastructure has been degraded, but the problem is not that we lack opportunities to brush up against one another. They confuse the possibility of interaction with the incentive and desire to interact; they confuse their own set decoration for the provision of a common script. You cannot put a bunch of random actors on a stage and expect them to fumble their way toward a play. When a spirit of community does unfold ex nihilo in one of their spaces, the simplest explanation is selection bias: When they open locations based on proximity to a Whole Foods or an Apple store, they are masking the sorting mechanism they\u2019ve used to build their brand.\nWeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork.\nAs for me, I never went to any of those free yoga classes; I suppose I can\u2019t really speak for Williamsburg\u2019s other members, but perhaps that\u2019s the point. I was an extracurricular truant in part because I liked my own yoga classes just fine and in part because the WeWork events I did attend were so networky. Also, I always had too much work. It\u2019s tempting to underline the paradox that, in my case, a WeWork yoga class could very plausibly have counted as work, but then again the very same could be said for any of North Fourth Street\u2019s accountants or kombucha marketers \u2014 not to make allies in anticipation of disaster but to trawl for more clients and contractors.\nAnd I didn\u2019t really care to go to the holiday party either. The anarchic thrill of a masquerade is electrifying only insofar as it feels genuinely remissive: A harvest ritual only makes sense as a reprieve from the collective sacrifices of the season. One thing that executives at Philip Morris and Disney understood was that cultures succeed in the attempt to organize and structure human behavior only when they address both what you are permitted to do and what you are obligated to do. \u201cDo what you love\u201d is only half a culture; what\u2019s missing is the idea that there might be some deep reward, beyond the gratification of self-discipline, for doing what you have to do even when you don\u2019t love it \u2014 in other words, for doing work. An authority that can\u2019t compel is not an authority that can protect or inspire.\nWeWork\u2019s own precedent puts its employees in an excellent position to understand this dynamic. A recent executive mandate declared the company a \u201cmeat-free\u201d organization. When I interviewed McKelvey not long after the Summit, he had a very fuzzy time trying to explain the meaning of the \u201ceight pillars\u201d of its CultureOS and the relationships among them. But when he noticed that the P.R. representative happened to be carrying a single-use plastic water bottle, he admonished her to be mindful of her own consumption. For all the company\u2019s vaulting ambition to build the workplace of the future, this was much closer to Walt Disney than Milton Friedman.\nOver the past year, as WeWork has been folded into what is now called the We Company \u2014 which encompasses WeGrow, its school, and WeLive, its communal housing projects \u2014 its Powered by We product has been refined and formalized. Recently, I met with Lakshmi Rengarajan, its director of workplace connection and a recent recruit from Match.com, and Craig Robinson, a veteran of commercial real estate who now served as global head of Powered by We Services, along with two P.R. representatives; the company\u2019s data show that people prefer small conference rooms to medium-size ones, and the five of us were pressed into intimacy by the vitrine they\u2019d reserved.\nRengarajan and Robinson were careful to italicize the idea that they\u2019re not trying to foist their own strong, participatory, idiosyncratic culture on anybody else\u2019s shop. Their services, while inspired by and grounded in the company\u2019s internal environment, begin with WeWork\u2019s tailored attempts to understand the client\u2019s own organizational structure and needs. They did, of course, have a repertoire of connective practices that seemed to them universally valuable. Rengarajan told me that \u201cthe first step toward someone being seen as a full human\u201d was to begin with something as simple as a round of stories about where people\u2019s first names came from; she explained that a former boss, unable for some reason to pronounce the name Lakshmi, had simply called her Sue. Robinson, who had personally experienced Rengarajan\u2019s exercise twice, said that the activity made it easy to remember Rengarajan because her name meant she was born on a Monday. \u201cOr maybe it wasn\u2019t Monday?\u201d\n\u201cFriday,\u201d she said, and laughed.\nBut they were not so presumptuous as to expect that Sprint or UBS would have a cafeteria that served no meat. I wondered how far they would extend themselves to help a firm help its employees to do what they loved. Would they be willing to work with, say, Philip Morris? Everyone tried to sustain simultaneous eye contact with me while they all paused to give it some thought.\n\u201cThat,\u201d each repeated in turn with total, collective sincerity, \u201cis a great question.\u201d They were going to have to talk about it.\nGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

Was Obama too soft on Russia?\nThe real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American!\nLeaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!\nThe spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!\nFAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and \"sources,\" is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!\nThe Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!\nThe FBI is totally unable to stop the national security \"leakers\" that have permeated our government for a long time. They can't even......\nfind the leakers within the FBI itself. Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW\nRussia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!\n...intentional. This whole narrative is a way of saving face for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed.....\n...to win. The Democrats are overplaying their hand. They lost the election, and now they have lost their grip on reality. The real story...\n...is all of the illegal leaks of classified and other information. It is a total \"witch hunt!\"\nThe first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\nJust out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.\nIs it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!\nI'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!\nHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\nIs it true the DNC would not allow the FBI access to check server or other equipment after learning it was hacked? Can that be possible?\nWho was it that secretly said to Russian President, \"Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?\" @foxandfriends\nFor eight years Russia \"ran over\" President Obama, got stronger and stronger, picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends\nJames Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!\nThe Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!\nThe real story that Congress, the FBI and all others should be looking into is the leaking of Classified information. Must find leaker now!\nWhat about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also, is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?\nJust watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!\nWhy isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech....\n...money to Bill, the Hillary Russian \"reset,\" praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!\nWatch @foxandfriends now on Podesta and Russia!\nWhy doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton - sale of Uranium?\nMike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!\nWhen will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?\nIt is the same Fake News Media that said there is \"no path to victory for Trump\" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!\nWow, @FoxNews just reporting big news. Source: \"Official behind unmasking is high up. Known Intel official is responsible. Some unmasked....\n..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated.\" If this is true, does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S.\nThe real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.\nSuch amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. \"Spied on before nomination.\" The real story.\nWas the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?\n.@FoxNews from multiple sources: \"There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump. This is unprecedented.\" @FBI\nFBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...\n...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?\nSusan Rice, the former National Security Advisor to President Obama, is refusing to testify before a Senate Subcommittee next week on.....\n...allegations of unmasking Trump transition officials. Not good!\nWhen will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?\nGeneral Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration - but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that.\nAsk Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H. Counsel.\nDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \"no evidence\" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.\nSally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today --- she said nothing but old news!\nThe Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?\nBiggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance. Why doesn't the media report on this? #FakeNews!\nCryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, \"I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.\" Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp\nThe Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\nJames Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job, bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.\nComey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!\nWatching Senator Richard Blumenthal speak of Comey is a joke. \"Richie\" devised one of the greatest military frauds in U.S. history. For....\nyears, as a pol in Connecticut, Blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in Vietnam - except he was never there. When....\ncaught, he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness...and now he is judge & jury. He should be the one who is investigated for his acts.\nThe Roger Stone report on @CNN is false - Fake News. Have not spoken to Roger in a long time - had nothing to do with my decision.\nDems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!\nRussia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.\nAgain, the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.\nJames Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\nWhen James Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there is no collusion, when does it end?\nI have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....\nThis is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!\nWith all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!\nRussian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.\nSo now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their....\n...case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing \"the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan...\" Witch Hunt!\nCrooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.\nThe big story is the \"unmasking and surveillance\" of people that took place during the Obama Administration.\nI believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'\nA.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!\nThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice\nYou are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA\nWhy is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my non-dealings are?\nCrooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer, 'bleached' emails, & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?\nAfter 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my \"collusion with the Russians,\" nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!\nDespite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America, the economic & jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down, jobs and enthusiasm way up!\nI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt\nFormer Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.\nBy the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?\n...Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election). It's all a big Dem HOAX!\n...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!\nWith all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea...\n...whether there are \"tapes\" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.\nJust out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?\nSince the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!\nObama Administration official said they \"choked\" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?\nThe reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..\n...and did not want to \"rock the boat.\" He didn't \"choke,\" he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.\nThe real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...\n..under a magnifying glass, they have zero \"tapes\" of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!\nFrom @FoxNews \"Bombshell: In 2016, Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election.\" Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!\nWow, CNN had to retract big story on \"Russia,\" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!\nFake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!\nSo they caught Fake News CNN cold, but what about NBC, CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!\nEveryone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!\n...and safe. Questions were asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don't....\n...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?\nJames Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!\nMy son Donald did a good job last night. He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!\n.@WashTimes states \"Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump.\"\nWhy aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!\nHillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?\nThank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.\nA new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post,this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!\nWhile all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS\nSo many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?\n...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia, including Podesta Company, Uranium deal, Russian Reset, big dollar speeches etc.\nMy son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33,000 e-mails!\nAs the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues, two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold, Democrats and Russians!\nAfter 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found, Chuck Schumer just stated that \"Democrats should blame ourselves,not Russia.\"\nSo why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\nSleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into \"Russia,\" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!\nUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - \"quietly working to boost Clinton.\" So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!\nProblem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!\nJared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!\nWhy didn't A.G. Sessions replace Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got....\n...big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton and her representatives. Drain the Swamp!\n\"One of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the Russians collected and spread negative information.....\n...about then candidate Trump.\" Catherine Herridge @FoxNews. So why doesn't Fake News report this? Witch Hunt! Purposely phony reporting.\nAfter many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security, the tougher the better!\n...and West Virginia. The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs.....\nInteresting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!\nNever in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal. He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....\n...conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?\nE-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.\n@foxandfriends According to report just out, President Obama knew about Russian interference 3 years ago but he didn't want to anger Russia!\nJames Clapper, who famously got caught lying to Congress, is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?\nWow, looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!\nThe Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?\nThe greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media \"screaming\" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next, she was a bad candidate!\nWow, FBI confirms report that James Comey drafted letter exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton long before investigation was complete. Many..\n...people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?\nAs it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!\nUranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!\nWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?\n.@foxandfriends \"Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation\"\nOfficials behind the now discredited \"Dossier\" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.\nCrooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!\n\"Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President.\" @FoxNews\nIt is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!\nNever seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....\n...the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,....\n...\"collusion,\" which doesn't exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's...\n...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!\nAll of this \"Russia\" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!\nReport out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd!\nSorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????\n....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!\nThe Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was \"no collusion\" and events mentioned took place long before he...\n....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!\nThe biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is....\n....earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!\nDonna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H....\n....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?\nThe @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch. James Comey's leadership was a disaster!\nEverybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..\n...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...\n....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!\nThe real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!\nPocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.\nThe rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!\nDoes the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.\nSince the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nCharles McCullough, the respected fmr Intel Comm Inspector General, said public was misled on Crooked Hillary Emails. \u201cEmails endangered National Security.\u201d Why aren't our deep State authorities looking at this? Rigged & corrupt? @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity\nThe House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\nSo General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday \u201cinterrogation\u201d with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?\nMany people in our Country are asking what the \u201cJustice\u201d Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and \u201cacid washed\u201d 33,000 Emails? No justice!\nCongratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and \u201cpapers\u201d should do the same with their Fake News!\nI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\nTainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI \u201cagent's role in Clinton probe under review.\u201d Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.\nAfter years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.\nReport: \u201cANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE\u201d Now it all starts to make sense!\nA must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!\nHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\nWow, \u201cFBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,\u201d according to @FoxNews.\n.@FoxNews-FBI's Andrew McCabe, \u201cin addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.\u201d\nWOW, @foxandfrlends \u201cDossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.\u201d And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!\nCrooked Hillary Clinton's top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others\nWell, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!\nNow that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....\nThe fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!\nThe single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!\nDisproven and paid for by Democrats \u201cDossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?\u201d @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!\n\u201cHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.\u201d This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\nIn one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!\nWhere are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!\nGreat jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!\n\u201cThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....\n...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn't straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.\u201d Wall Street Journal\nLittle Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\nNEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!\nThe Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!\nPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\n\u201cMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he's been victimized. He's been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......\n....agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don't believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).\u201d Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews\nRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\n\u201cCharges Deal Don A Big Win,\u201d written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that \u201cthe Russians had no impact on the election results.\u201d There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. \u201cShe lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.\u201d\nDeputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\nFunny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!\nVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!\nGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\nFinally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!\nI never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said \u201cit may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u201d The Russian \u201choax\u201d was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\nNow that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn't I a great candidate?\nIf it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\nThank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo\nObama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?\nThank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!\n....The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to \u201crock the boat.\u201d When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.\nI have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!\nBad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!\nQuestion: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!\nDem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!\n\u201cRussians had no compromising information on Donald Trump\u201d @FoxNews Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!\n\u201cCongressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts\u201d @FoxNews So, what else is new. He is a total phony!\n\u201cHe's got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton's criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.\u201d @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show\n\u201cI've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don't see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.\u201d Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\n\u201cWe've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don't see it.\u201d Judge Ken Starr\nWITCH HUNT!\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\nWhy did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....\n...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.\nTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp\nThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\nWow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked \u201chave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?\u201d He said strongly \u201cnever, no.\u201d He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.\nSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\nWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\nA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\n...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!\u201d So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.\nI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......\n\u201cSpecial Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am still opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....\nHouse Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.\nMany lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......\n....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!\nSo sad that the Department of \u201cJustice\u201d and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!\nLawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD!\nWhat does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good!\n\u201cThe FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....\u201d and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld\nAttorney\u201d\u201cclient privilege is dead!\nA TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!\nThe Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story!\nMuch of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!\nIf I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!\nJames Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....\n....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst \u201cbotch jobs\u201d of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!\nDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!\nUnbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!\nThe big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more?\nComey throws AG Lynch \u201cunder the bus!\u201d Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!\nI never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His \u201cmemos\u201d are self serving and FAKE!\nAttorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!\nSlippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!\nComey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!\nSlippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!\nJames Comey just threw Andrew McCabe \u201cunder the bus.\u201d Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?\nJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\nSo General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!\nJust heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.\nJames Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?\nThe New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will \u201cflip.\u201d They use....\n....it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\nSo funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!\nJames Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others?\nThe Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as \u201cMr. Magoo\u201d and Rod Rosenstein as \u201cMr. Peepers.\u201d This is \u201caccording to people with whom the president has spoken.\u201d There are no such people and don't know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!\n\u201cAt least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.\u201d Wall Street Journal\n\u201cGOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.\u201d @FoxNews Good luck with that request!\nA complete Witch Hunt!\nKim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, \u201cyou got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there.\u201d Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!\nJust Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. \u201cNo evidence\u201d that the Trump Campaign \u201ccolluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.\u201d Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!\nHouse Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!\n\u201cClapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN\u201d @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.\nSo disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were \u201cleaked\u201d to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!\nIt would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!\nThere was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!\n\u201cThe questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone...\u201d Joe Digenova, former US Attorney\nNEW BOOK - A MUST READ! \u201cThe Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\u201d by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!\nA Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal \u201cjustice?\u201d At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!\nThe Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it's called Fighting Back\nThe 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait \u201d\u02dctill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!\nLisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!\nIs this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\nSenator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn't really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!\nCan you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it!\nCongratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!\nWow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI \u201cSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.\u201d Andrew McCarthy says, \u201cThere's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.\u201d If so, this is bigger than Watergate!\nDespite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and \u201cHaters,\u201d but that's the way it is!\n\u201cApparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit.\u201d David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff!\nWhy isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!\nReports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a \u201chot\u201d Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!\nIf the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!\nThings are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World's most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!\n....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption...\n...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.\nNow that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!\nWhat ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?\n....and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?\nThe Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they're looking at the rest of the World. Oh' great!\nI hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\n\u201cJohn Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....\n....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which....\n...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself, he's worried about staying out of Jail.\u201d Dan Bongino\nThe Wall Street Journal asks, \u201cWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?\u201d A very good question!\n...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!\nIf the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...\n@foxandfriends \u201cNew Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?\u201d Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!\nLook how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!\n\u201cIt's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano\nSPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\n\u201cTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign\u201d No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!\nWITCH HUNT!\nClapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!\nNot surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE\nThe Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an \u201cInformant\u201d who is paid a fortune and who \u201csets up\u201d way earlier than the Russian Hoax?\nCan anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!\n\u201cEveryone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.\u201d Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!\nWith Spies, or \u201cInformants\u201d as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or \u201cJustice\u201d contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?\nThis whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!\nWhen will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia?\nWho's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!\nWhy didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation!\nWhy didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.\n\u201cThe President deserves some answers.\u201d @FoxNews in discussing \u201cSPYGATE.\u201d\n\u201cSally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.\u201d Jonathan Turley\n\u201cWe now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.\u201d Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\n\u201cThis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and scandalous.\u201d Mollie Hemingway\nThe 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!\nWhy aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!\nSorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.\nThe Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, I'm President!\nRep.Trey Gowdy, \u201cI don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's....\n....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, \u201d\u02dcoh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and that's how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you.....\n....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!\u201d And I wish I did!\nThe soon to be released book, \u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump,\u201d written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks.\n\u201cThe recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.\u201d JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.\nRUSH LIMBAUGH \u201cIf the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren't targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.\u201d\nIger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!\nThe corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?\nNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\nA.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!\n\u201cJohn Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar, he's a liar about being a liar.\u201d Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends\n....\u201c$17 million spent, it's a scam Investigation. Americans are being worked. We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats. The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $'s to Crooked H).\u201d Dan Bongino\nThere was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?\nJesse Watters \u201cThe only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.\u201d So true!\nAs only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of \u201cJustice\u201d have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!\n....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired!\nMark Penn \u201cWhy are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.\u201d A disgrace!\nAs has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!\nThe appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!\nThe Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.\nWhat is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!\nThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\nWow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!\nGreat interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?\nChris Farrell, Judicial Watch. \u201cThey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...\n...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff\n....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!\nAlan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: \u201cIt all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate.\u201d So true!\nWhen and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?\nOur Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a \u201cplea deal\u201d to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!\nWhen will people start saying, \u201cthank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?\u201d\nThe Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this \u201cmatter\u201d (as Comey would call it). Investigate!\nNow that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.\nSo, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!\nFBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that \u201cwe'll stop\u201d candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn't get any lower than that!\nThe IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!\n\u201cWhy in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)?\u201d asks Mark Levin!\n\u201cDonald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey.\u201d Mark Levin\nWow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!\nI've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!\nThe IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!\nDaniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: \u201cThis IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein's memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.\u201d Witch Hunt!\nWITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!\nWhy was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn't matter to them!\nWhy was the FBI's sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe'll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!\n\u201cThe highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.\u201d Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn't it?\nComey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey's best friend. Witch Hunt!\nI can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!\u201d Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p\n\u201cFBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.\u201d @FoxNews Big News, but the Fake News doesn't want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!\nOur great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy,\u201d which is fantastic. Go get it!\n.@FoxNews Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!\nThe Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!\nI have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents?\nWhy is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn't this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?\nThe hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!\n\u201cThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano\nLover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!\nRussia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!\nPeter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!\nWhen is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and......\n....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...And what is going on in the FBI & DOJ with Crooked Hillary, the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!\nJust won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others), colluded with Russia. They haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!\nPublic opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the \u201cSpecial\u201d Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!\nThe Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more. It's a Democrat Con Job!\nEx-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!\nHow can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!\nAs I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews\n....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?\nThe stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?\nThese Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn't Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!\nHeading to Helsinki, Finland \u2013 looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...\nPresident Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!\nOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\nThe meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!\nWhile I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\nThank you @RandPaul. \u201cThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed to think?\u201d\nSo many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!\nSome people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome!\nThe Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!\n\u201cTrump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.\u201d Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don't want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.\nI got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!\nInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!\nThe Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the \u201d\u02dc16 Election never ends!\nNo Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!\nCongratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of \u201cJustice\u201d and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!\nLooking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\nAndrew McCarthy - \u201cI said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.\u201d On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!\nI had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!\n.@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews \u201cSource #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes, the Dirty Dossier, paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump, and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...\u201d ILLEGAL!\nSo President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn't he do something about it? Why didn't he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that's why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!\nSo we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!\nWhen you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!\n\u201cIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....\n....and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....\n.....\u201dCarter Page wasn't a spy, wasn't an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.\u201d Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America. They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now!\n\u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump\u201d is a Hot Seller, already Number One! More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!\nWhat kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!\n.@AlanDersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn't vote for me, has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. He has written a new and very important book...\n...called \u201cThe Case Against Impeaching Trump,\u201d which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read!\n....,the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO,....\n.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\nThere is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\nIs Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..\n....Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama....And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?\nCollusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!\n\u201cFBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. He needed an insurance policy. Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election. He should never, ever been allowed to........\n.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won't go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.\u201d ALAN DERSHOWITZ....\n..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!\nPaul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!\nRussian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!\nLooking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and \u201cPublic Enemy Number One,\u201d or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?\n\u201cWe already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?\u201d Marc Thiessen, Washington Post\nCongratulations to @GreggJarrett on The TREMENDOUS success of his just out book, \u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump.\u201d Already number one on Amazon. Hard work from a brilliant guy. It's the Real Story of the Rigged Witch Hunt!\nCongratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book, \u201cTHE RUSSIA HOAX, THE ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD TRUMP,\u201d going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon. It is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. Great book!\nFake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!\n...Why aren't Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!\nToo bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS!\n\u201cCollusion with Russia was very real. Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians, and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT. We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through....\n....a law firm, eventually Kremlin connected sources, to gather info on Donald Trump. Collusion is very real with Russia, but only with Hillary and the Democrats, and we should demand a full investigation.\u201d Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends Looking forward to the new IG Report!\n\u201cThere has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite, that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.\u201d @GrahamLedger\nThis is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Phony Dossier, FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 Angry Dems? Stay tuned!\n@LindseyGrahamSC \u201cWhy didn't the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?\u201d They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?\nJenna Ellis \u201cFBI thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.\u201d\n.@MariaBartiromo \u201cNo evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians - and here we are, a year and a half later.\u201d\nWhy isn't the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won't give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.....\n.....Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!\nThe big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC....\n.@JudgeJeanine \u201cBob Mueller, isn't your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier, paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump, & used to con a FISA Court Judge. Bob, I really think it's time for you to give up your phony investigation.\u201d No Collusion!\n\u201cSeems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President\u201d. @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends If this had happened to the other side, everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time.\nAgent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!\nJust fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!\nTom Fitton of Judicial Watch: \u201cThe Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else. There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok & his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI. We know this...\n....guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus. Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. Instead, Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. He used Strzok, he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing....\n....should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.\u201d Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn't have said it better myself!\nBruce Ohr of the \u201cJustice\u201d Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele \u201cfind dirt on Trump.\u201d Ohr's wife, Nelly, was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier. @foxandfriends\n\u201cThey were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn't do.\u201d Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people.\nFired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!\nStrzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn't this so-called \u201cprobe\u201d ended immediately? Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?\nLou Dobbs: \u201cThis cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.\u201d Thank you Lou, so true!\nThe Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the \u201coriginators and founders\u201d of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!\n\u201cThe action (the Strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey's skinny inner circle.\u201d Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director.\n\u201cJohn Brennan is a stain on the Country, we deserve better than this.\u201d Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book, \u201cSpygate, the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan, and good luck with the book!\n\u201cHillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI. We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump\u201d concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt. JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.\nMark Levin \u201cWhen they had power they didn't stop the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, they funded the Iranians & are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election & trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.\u201d\n\u201cI'd strip the whole bunch of them. They're all corrupt. They've all abused their power. They've all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States.\u201d @seanhannity\n\u201cThe FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department & whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).\u201d Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.\n\u201cWhile Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.\u201d Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words, they were colluding with Russia!\n\u201cVery concerned about Comey's firing, afraid they will be exposed,\u201d said Bruce Ohr. DOJ's Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr's connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!\n.@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: \u201cHow did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?\u201d Now that is a really good question! Then followed by \u201cRichard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...\u201d So true, a total Fake!\nHow can \u201cSenator\u201d Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? Loser!\n\u201c....An incredibly corrupt FBI & DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election. Brennan has gone off the deep end, he's disgraced and discredited himself. His conduct has been outrageous.\u201d Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch.\n\u201cDirector Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. If Director Brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA, why didn't he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment......\n.....released in 2017. If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach......\u201d Richard Burr (R-NC) Senate Intel Cmte Chair @LouDobbs\n\u201cFox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.\u201d Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED!\n\u201cBruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it's astonishing that he's still employed. Bruce & Nelly Ohr's bank account is getting fatter & fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling. He doesn't disclose it under Fed Regs. Using your Federal office for personal.......\n....financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation, Bribery Statute Violation, Honest Services Violation....all Major Crimes....because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions......\u201d Gregg Jarrett. So when does Mueller do what must be done? Probably never! @FoxNews\nAll of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China. But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!\nHas anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-attacks-obstruction-investigation.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur", "tags": [{"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.86814"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.73153"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.41904"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.41530"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.31645"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.28107"}, {"label": "espionage", "score": "0.23687"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.21350"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.19569"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.19461"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.19229"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.16540"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.16132"}, {"label": "russia-international relations-us", "score": "0.09180"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.08893"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.08237"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.08183"}, {"label": "intelligence services", "score": "0.07422"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.07253"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.06700"}, {"label": "intelligence", "score": "0.05926"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.05921"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.04726"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.04670"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.03418"}, {"label": "disclosure of information", "score": "0.03269"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.02426"}, {"label": "freedom of the press", "score": "0.02420"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.02148"}, {"label": "government information policies", "score": "0.02099"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Russia", "Iran", "Russia", "USA", "Crimea", "TAKEN", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "Crimea", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Trump", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "Trump", "Trump", "Russia", "Russia", "Trump", "Russia", "Washington", "U.S.", "Connecticut", "Vietnam", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "America", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Moscow", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Connecticut", "Vietnam", "U.S.history", "Vietnam", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Pocahontas", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "@TuckerCarlson @seanhannity", "United States", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "RUSSIA", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "Russia", "the @nypost", "Florida", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "China", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Moscow", "America", "Russia", "Crimea", "Syria", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "RUSSIA", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Ukraine", "Ukraine", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "Russia", "America", "Russia", "Russia", "North Korea", "China", "US", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Virginia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "D.C.", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Washington", "D.C.", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "the United States", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Iran", "the United States", "Singapore", "North Korea", "U.S.", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Russia", "Helsinki", "Finland", "Moscow", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "Russia", "Helsinki", "Russia", "Russia", "Trump", "Russia", "America", "Russia", "S.C.", "USA", "Russia", "Russia", "Trump", "Russia", "Russia", "U.S.", "the United States", "Russia", "Connecticut", "Connecticut", "Vietnam", "Vietnam", "@LouDobbs", "Russia", "Russia", "China"], "ORG": ["@MSNBC & @CNN", "NSA", "NSA & FBI", "the Obama Administration", "FBI", "FBI", "the Obama Administration", "White House", "DNC", "FBI", "Potus", "Electoral College &", "Congress", "FBI", "DNC", "FBI", "NBC", "ABC", "the House Intelligence Committee", "Bill & Hillary", "Uranium", "Podesta Russian Company", "MAGA", "Watch @foxandfriends", "Podesta", "Podesta", "Uranium", "media & Dems", "Intel", "SURVEILLANCE", "FBI", "National Security", "Senate", "Russia &", "DNC", "FBI", "the Obama Administration", "W.H.

Devote $50 billion to \"jumpstarting the economy, helping economic growth, and preventing another one million jobs from being lost,\" including assistance to states and localities to prevent them from having to cut their vital services.\nEnsure that the foreclosure prevention program enacted by Congress is implemented \"quickly and effectively so that at-risk homeowners can get help and hopefully stay in their homes.\" (The measure includes a plan to help troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure by refinancing their mortgages with more affordable government-insured loans.) Reform bankruptcy laws.\nEnd tax breaks for companies that ship American jobs overseas and provide incentives for companies that keep and maintain good jobs in the United States. Invest in advanced energy technologies and create \"millions of new, good 'Green Collar' American jobs.\"\nEnforce pay-as-you-go budgeting rules. Honor these rules by ending Iraq war, eliminating waste in existing government programs, generating revenue by charging polluters for releasing greenhouse gases and ending \"special interest driven corporate loopholes and tax cuts for the wealthy.\" Put all non emergency bills, passed by Congress, online for five days, to allow the public to review and comment on them before they are signed into law. Publish searchable, online information about federal grants, contracts, earmarks, loans, and lobbyist contacts with government officials.\nSupport \"timely and carefully targeted aid to those hurt by the housing crisis so that affected individuals can have a chance to trade a burdensome mortgage for a manageable loan that reflects their home\u2019s market value.\" \"Government action must not implicitly encourage anyone to borrow more than they can afford to repay.\"\nReduce corporate tax rate \"so that American companies stay competitive with their foreign counterparts and American jobs can remain in this country.\" Encourage agreements to reduce trade barriers that limit market access for U.S. products, commodities and services: \"Greater international trade, aggressively advanced on a truly level playing field, will mean more American jobs.\" New nuclear energy plants will rejuvenate industrial and manufacturing base, \"with nearly 15,000 high quality jobs created for every new nuclear plant built.\"\nImpose an immediate moratorium on the earmarking system and reform the appropriations process through full transparency. One-year pause in non-defense, non-veterans discretionary spending. Call for presidential line-item veto. \"New authorizations should be offset by reducing another program, and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization.\"\nAll Americans should have coverage they can afford. Families and individuals should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans, including many private health insurance options and a public plan. Coverage should be made affordable for all Americans with subsidies provided through tax credits and other means. Insurance should be portable from job to job.\nStrengthen Medicare by cutting costs and protecting seniors from fraud. Fix Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program: \"Repeal the prohibition on negotiating prescription drug prices, ban drug companies from paying generic producers to refrain from entering drug markets, and eliminate drug company interference with generic competition.\" Phase-out the cap on Medicaid funding and phase-in equal participation in other federal health care assistance programs. Provide Medicaid to more low-income HIV-positive Americans.\nAutomatically enroll every worker in a workplace pension plan that can be carried from job to job and match savings for low-income working families. Ask those making over $250,000 \"to pay a bit more\" in payroll taxes for Social Security. (Currently, only income up to $102,000 is subject to the payroll tax).\n\"We will not replace the current system with the staggering inefficiency, maddening irrationality, and uncontrollable costs of a government monopoly.\" Make insurance more affordable and more secure, and give employees the option of owning coverage that is not tied to their job. Every one should receive the same tax benefit as those who are insured through work, whether through a tax credit or other means.\nRevive Medicare by rewarding quality care, promoting competition, eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, and giving patients and providers control over treatment options. Give Medicaid recipients more health care options: \"We envision a new Medicaid partnership with the states, improving public health through flexibility and innovation.\"\n\"No changes in the system should adversely affect any current or near-retiree. Comprehensive reform should include the opportunity to freely choose to create your own personal investment accounts which are distinct from and supplemental to the overall Social Security system.\"\nReduce oil consumption by at least 35 percent, or ten million barrels per day, by 2030. \"We can\u2019t drill our way to energy independence \u2026 we must invest in research and development, and deployment of renewable energy technologies\u2014such as solar, wind, geothermal, as well as technologies to store energy through advanced batteries and clean up our coal plants.\" Commit to fast-track investment of billions of dollars over the next ten years to establish a green energy sector. Stand up to \"oil companies that spend hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and political contributions.\"\n\"Implement a market-based cap and trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary to avoid catastrophic change and we will set interim targets along the way to ensure that we meet our goal.\"\nReach out to the leaders of the biggest carbon emitting nations and ask them to join a new Global Energy Forum. \"We need a global response to climate change that includes binding and enforceable commitments to reducing emissions, especially for those that pollute the most: the United States, China, India, the European Union, and Russia.\"\n\"Aggressively support technological advances to reduce petroleum dependence.\" Support \"accelerated exploration, drilling and development in America, from new oilfields off the nation\u2019s coasts to onshore fields such as those in Montana, North Dakota, and Alaska.\" Pursue dramatic increases in the use of all forms of safe, affordable, reliable \u2014 and clean \u2014 nuclear power. Advocate a long-term energy tax credit equally applicable to all renewable power sources. Modernize the nation\u2019s electricity grid. Support coal-to-liquid and gasification initiatives and investment in the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies.\nSupport technology-driven, market-based solutions that will decrease emissions. \"We can \u2014 and should \u2014 address the risk of climate change based on sound science without succumbing to the no-growth radicalism that treats climate questions as dogma rather than as situations to be managed responsibly.\"\n\"Because the issue of climate change is global, it must become a truly global concern as well\u2026. It would be unrealistic and counterproductive to expect the U.S. to carry burdens which are more appropriately shared by all.\"\nBring the war to a \"responsible end\". Withdraw combat brigades at the pace of one to two per month and complete redeployment within sixteen months. Keep a residual force in Iraq to target terrorists, protect American personnel and support Iraq\u2019s Security Forces, \"provided the Iraqis make political progress.\"\nSend at least two additional combat brigades and seek greater contributions from NATO allies. Build special forces and intelligence capacity; train, equip and advise Afghan security forces; and build Afghan governmental capacity. Help grow Afghanistan\u2019s economy \u201cfrom the bottom up, with an additional $1 billion in non-military assistance each year.\"\nPrevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapon with \u201ctougher sanctions and aggressive, principled, and direct high-level diplomacy, without preconditions.\u201d \u201cBy going the extra diplomatic mile, while keeping all options on the table, we make it more likely the rest of the world will stand with us to increase pressure on Iran, if diplomacy is failing.\u201d\nIncrease the size of the Army by 65,000 troops and the Marines by 27,000 troops.\nSupport \"constitutional protections and judicial oversight on any surveillance program involving Americans.\" Review the current Administration\u2019s warrantless wiretapping program: \"We reject illegal wiretapping of American citizens, wherever they live.\" (Senator Barack Obama voted for a 2008 bill that expanded that overhauled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and expanded the government's surveillance power).\nClose the detention camp in Guantanamo Bay. \"We will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries, or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes, or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.\"\nNo timetable for withdrawal. The outcome is \"too critical to our own national security to be jeopardized by artificial or politically inspired timetables that neither reflect conditions on the ground nor respect the essential advice of our military commanders.\"\nEstablish a nationwide counterinsurgency strategy led by a unified commander. Increase number of troops \u201cboth from NATO countries and through a doubling in size of the Afghan army.\u201d \u201cWe flatly reject the Democratic Party\u2019s idea that America can succeed in Afghanistan only by failure in Iraq.\u201d\nCall for a \u201csignificant increase in political, economic, and diplomatic pressure\u201d to prevent Iran from pursuing nuclear capability. Tighten sanctions against Iran and the companies with business operations in or with Iran. Oppose \u201cpresidential-level, unconditional dialogue with the regime in Iran until it takes steps to improve its behavior.\u201d \u201cThe U.S. must retain all options\u201d in dealing with Iran.\n\"Although our country has thwarted new terrorist attacks since 2001, those threats do persist. That is why our reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was so vital, and why the Democrats\u2019 opposition to it was so wrong.\"\nNot mentioned.\nRequire those \u201cliving here illegally but otherwise playing by the rule\u201d to \u201cget right with the law.\u201d Support a system that requires undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine, pay taxes, learn English, and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens.\nIncrease the number of immigration visas for family members of people living here and for immigrants who meet the demand for jobs that employers cannot fill, as long as appropriate labor market protections and standards are in place.\nCrack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. Establish an employer verification system that is \u201caccurate, fair to legal workers, safeguards people\u2019s privacy, and cannot be used to discriminate against workers.\u201d\nSupport additional personnel, infrastructure, and technology on the border and at ports of entry. Increase the number Customs and Border Protection agents and equip them with \u201cbetter technology and real-time intelligence.\u201d\nNo path to legalization. \u201cWe oppose amnesty. The rule of law suffers if government policies encourage or reward illegal activity.\u201d Deny federal funds to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d for illegal immigrants. (Senator John McCain co-sponsored a 2006 bill that called for establishing guest-worker program and setting up a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants that included learning English and paying fines.)\nEncourage legal immigrants to learn English and \u201cfoster legally present immigrants\u2019 integration into American life to advance respect for the rule of law and a common American identity.\" Oppose granting refugee status \"on the basis of lifestyle or other non-political factors.\u201d Update the H-1B guest-worker visa program \u201cto reflect our need for more leaders in science and technology.\u201d\nAuthorize an internet-based system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees and enact a \"phased in requirement\" that employers use the system.\nGive border patrol agents \u201cthe tools and resources they need to protect our sovereignty.\u201d Complete the border fence quickly and securing the borders.

So He Sued an Energy Company in Germany.\nClimate Chaos Is Coming \u2014 and the Pinkertons Are Ready\nAs they see it, global warming stands to make corporate security as high-stakes in the 21st century as it was in the 19th.\nThe Pinkertons wanted me to picture myself in a scene of absolute devastation. \u201cA hurricane just wipes out everything, and you need to feed your children,\u201d Andres Paz Larach said. The power grid is down, shipments of food are cut off, the water is no longer potable \u2014 how do you get what you need to survive? What risks do you take? It was a hot early morning in March, and we were driving through a pine forest high in the mountains surrounding Santa Ana Jilotzingo, 25 miles northwest of Mexico City. Our Suburban, equipped with bulletproof windows and reinforced doors, labored slowly over the dirt road, which appeared to have been washed out by a recent thunderstorm.\nFor much of the previous hour, Paz Larach and two other executives from Pinkerton, Carlos Manuel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos and Paul Rakov, had been explaining the company\u2019s philosophy of risk management. Now over 150 years old, having long outlived its reputation as Andrew Carnegie\u2019s personal militia, the agency has evolved into a modern security firm. Over the last decade or so, Pinkerton began noticing a growing set of anxieties among its corporate clients about distinctly contemporary plagues \u2014 active shooters, political unrest, climate disasters \u2014 and in response began offering data-driven risk analysis, in addition to what they\u2019re more traditionally known for. Dressed in an untucked powder blue oxford and round, rimless sunglasses, Paz Larach, the firm\u2019s senior vice president in charge of the Americas, paused before affecting a look of brutal candor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to turn to desperate measures,\u201d he said. Everybody will. The other Pinkertons nodded.\nI was seated in the rear row next to Rakov, a marketing officer who, at 51, had recently shifted his career from more traditional P.R. to Pinkerton. He was now fully fluent in the language of tactical response. He chimed in to observe that preparing for a disaster can carry its own risks. He gave the example of a drought. \u201cIf a client has food and water and all the other stuff,\u201d he said, \u201cthen they become a target.\u201d L\u00f3pez Portillo and Paz Larach uttered small words of consensus in Spanish, while scanning through email on their phones. \u201cAnd if and when desperate people discovered that cache of water and food,\u201d he continued, it was the Pinkertons\u2019 job to protect it at whatever cost.\n[Read about how Wall Street is hedging against the apocalypse.]\nOur destination that morning was a shooting range called Club de Tiro Jarib\u00fa, which Pinkerton sometimes uses for agent and client trainings. The idea had been to demonstrate what Pinkerton agents go through before they are deployed to disaster zones. L\u00f3pez Portillo had also lately fielded several inquiries from corporate clients, asking for lessons in tactical skills like evasive driving and extraction from disaster zones, both for themselves and sometimes hundreds or more of their employees. \u201cSomeone who works in corporate \u2014 say, as an attorney or salesperson,\u201d he said, \u201cthey find it something completely new and useful.\u201d\nAt the range, which was made up of seven terraced target areas bulldozed into a steep ridge, we were greeted by our instructor, Reynold Castro R\u00f3man. A former Mexican military officer, he wore black fatigues with the Pinkerton all-seeing-eye logo emblazoned on either shoulder. A kaffiyeh hid a long scar along his neck. During an intel mission 16 years ago, Castro R\u00f3man was flying over marijuana fields when the plane went down \u2014 from what Castro R\u00f3man suspected was narco fire \u2014 killing the three others on board. Since then, he has dedicated himself almost exclusively to private-sector urban-combat training, often for Pinkerton.\nOver the next three hours, Castro R\u00f3man worked us steadily through various readiness drills, including quick-draw methods, accuracy competitions and timed reloading under pressure. We shot nine-millimeter pistols and Israeli assault rifles. Considering all the firearms, the atmosphere was relaxed and sporting. Nearby, a man grilled chorizo and carne asada. A cooler and makeshift bar was stocked with beer, wine and mezcal.\nThe scene was a stark contrast to the big-data wonkery I was pitched in the car ride over. But Paz Larach explained that their statistical and tactical approaches were fundamentally connected. All businesses exposed themselves to risk, which had to be mitigated, insured or, more relevantly, defended against. Even if the Pinkertons couldn\u2019t predict the specific risks of the future, they had a general sense of what it might look like \u2014 and what opportunities they might avail themselves of as it materialized. According to the World Bank, by 2050 some 140 million people may be displaced by sea-level rise and extreme weather, driving escalations in crime, political unrest and resource conflict. Even if the most conservative predictions about our climate future prove overstated, a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in temperature during the next century will almost certainly provoke chaos, in what experts call climate change\u2019s \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d: Displacement begets desperation begets disorder. Reading these projections from the relative comforts of the C-suite, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see why a company might consider enhancing its security protocols.\nFor Pinkerton, the bet is twofold: first, that there\u2019s no real material difference between climate change and any other conflict \u2014 as the world grows more predictably dangerous, tactical know-how will simply be more in demand than ever. And second, that by adding data analytics, Pinkerton stands to compete more directly with traditional consulting firms like Deloitte, which offer pre- and postdisaster services (supply-chain monitoring, damage documentation, etc.), but which cannot, say, dispatch a helicopter full of armed guards to Guatemala in an afternoon. In theory, Pinkerton can do both \u2014 a fully militarized managerial class at corporate disposal.\nLater, after Paz Larach took his turn on the range \u2014 during which he emptied a Galil ACE assault rifle into a human-shaped cardboard cutout, then quickly drew his nine-millimeter, grouping four shots in the chest-cavity bull\u2019s-eye \u2014 he offered the example of Hurricane Maria. On the day the Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Puerto Rico in 2017, he received more than 30 calls from American businesses and multinationals. He wouldn\u2019t go into detail but explained that many chief executives felt blind to the situation and effectively tendered a blank check if Pinkerton could provide security. Over the next few days, as the company deployed hundreds of agents to the island, some of them, Paz Larach claimed, reported seeing firearms brandished at gas stations. \u201cWe had to escort the cargo with real agents, have cars chase the main truck,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who did not have protection were having their cargo hijacked.\u201d\nAware that he might end up sounding vampiric, Paz Larach hesitated, then eventually confessed what he\u2019d wanted to say in the first place: The future looked pretty good for Pinkerton.\nYou could be forgiven for assuming that the Pinkertons were relics of the past. Like the stage coaches the company once protected, the name Pinkerton summons up sepia-tinted images of the American West \u2014 black-hatted detectives pursuing train robbers, or rooting out labor agitators from coal mines. And indeed, Allan Pinkerton organized his agency in response to the lawlessness of the frontier. When he first began offering his services in the early 1850s, a majority of the territories west of the Mississippi remained ungoverned; few towns offered policing, and fewer still had the means to investigate crimes after the fact. Overnight, Pinkerton\u2019s novel methods of \u201ccrime detection,\u201d which included infiltrating gangs and developing networks of informants, became the standards of investigation, and his company became a sort of de facto national police force. According to some historians, by the late 19th century, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency numbered more men than the United States Army.\nIn the intervening years, the Pinkertons have survived in no small part because of their ability to adapt to the changing landscapes of crime. To differentiate his agency from common bounty hunters, Pinkerton worked to professionalize his ranks with formal attire, pay and badges and created what probably was the first national criminal database. In the following years, as railroads opened up the frontier and settlement brought with it the rule of law, Pinkerton turned to what he saw as the \u201criotous element\u201d growing in company towns. Between 1877 and 1892, Pinkertons were dispatched to break up some 70 labor strikes \u2014 either by going undercover to provide intel, or through brute force.\n[Read David Leonhardt on the economics of climate change.]\nIt was only after a particularly lethal clash during a strike in Homestead, Pa., in 1892 that the public began to wonder if the threat of the Pinkertons eclipsed those they supposedly protected against. In the years since the frontier closed, antitrust sentiment had grown, and demand for the Pinkertons lessened \u2014 in part because the government was more able to enforce its laws. In the aftermath of Homestead, Congress and 23 states passed \u201canti-Pinkerton\u201d acts, banning government bodies from hiring mercenaries as strikebreakers.\nIn the decades since, the Pinkertons have undertaken several rebrandings, each aimed at lowering their public profile, though through it all they never gave up the lucrative specter of their name: the Pinkerton Agency, Pinkerton\u2019s Inc., Pinkerton. During the first half of the 20th century, the company protected wartime factories and later began to seek out new markets in parts of the world, like India and China, where authority could still be outsourced. In 1999, the Swedish security giant Securitas AB absorbed the agency, buying it for a reported $384 million, and the company underwent rebranding once again, this time as a boutique risk-management firm. It began diversifying into intellectual-property services and cybersecurity. Among their most popular new services is the Pinkerton Dedicated Professional, in which agents join a client\u2019s company like any other new hire, allowing them to provide intel on employees. By 2018, the agency said it could count among its clients about 80 percent of Fortune 1,000 companies.\nThe best outcome for these new data-driven Pinkertons is that this century lapses into the kind of lawlessness and disorder that makes it look more like the 19th \u2014 which many scientists and economists think it could. Since 1980, a period that includes all 20 of the warmest years in recorded history and 18 of the 20 most intense hurricane seasons in the satellite era, losses in the United States from storms, wildfires and droughts topped $1.6 trillion \u2014 nearly a third of which occurred in just the last five years. And this exponential destruction is just the beginning of what David Wallace-Wells, in his book \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth,\u201d calls the Great Dying: a worldwide economic decline, sharply deteriorated living conditions, disruption to basic government functions and widespread hunger. Looking deeper still into the future, the predictions are even more dire. Over the next century, 3.7 degrees of warming could contribute to an additional 22,000 murders and 1.3 million burglaries in the United States.\nWhatever the exact costs of climate change, it is Pinkerton\u2019s job to read between the numbers looking for the potential for violence. If you\u2019re suffering only one hurricane every 20 years or so, shelling out $1 million to Pinkerton isn\u2019t such a big deal, Paz Larach explained; you bake it into your risk. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a disaster every year, which is happening more and more, it makes more sense to have dedicated staff on standby.\u201d A Pinkerton on standby doesn\u2019t mean protection for just your insurable risks but also for the uninsurable risks \u2014 business interruptions, theft of trade secrets, pandemics. And with the environment increasingly weaponized against the poor, to borrow Wallace-Wells\u2019s phrase, the sectors that rely on cheap labor will face more unrest among workers; the state will struggle to keep up with crime; and in the aftermath of storms, with landslides blocking first responders, regional offices will be cut off.\nAnd this, of course, is exactly the sort of environment in which the Pinkertons thrive.\nThe morning after weapons training, I found myself once again in the back of an armored Suburban. Paz Larach was talking on the phone beside me as we made our way to the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez, a racetrack where we were scheduled to learn evasive driving. Throughout my visit, the Pinkertons had insisted on providing me a full security detail, which included the armored car and two escorting agents, as a way of simulating executive protection. The two agents were clad in black suits and earpieces and shadowed me to dinner, interviews and an outing to the Templo Mayor Museum; rarely during the three days could I get either to chat with me. They treated the job, however farcical it seemed, gravely.\nLike people, companies could become habituated to modernity\u2019s relative safety, Paz Larach said. But it was his job to shock them out of such thinking, whether through exercises or data. For much of the last century, the traditional form of defense for businesses has been insurance compensation \u2014 pay a premium up front, recover later. But one of the many byproducts of this model of subsidized recovery, according to economists, has been unfettered growth along floodplains, hurricane-impact zones and other high-risk areas. After Hurricane Harvey, Pinkerton found clients were frustrated and open to alternatives. \u201cMost clients were not prepared enough,\u201d Paz Larach said. \u201cAn insurance policy is just a piece of paper.\u201d\n[Read about new legal strategies to make the world\u2019s biggest polluters pay for climate change.]\nPaz Larach rattled off a suite of services that were not, strictly speaking, covered by that piece of paper: armed warehouse defense, executive extraction, 24-hour surveillance, chartered helicopters and planes, escorted cargo shipments. \u201cIf you abandon your property, you\u2019re kind of just blindfolding yourself,\u201d he said \u2014 checking news, hoping for the best. \u201cWe\u2019re your eyes and ears on the ground.\u201d During the 2017 hurricane season, the Pinkertons chartered half a dozen planes across the Caribbean, each of them full of food and under armed escort, to the tune of around $100,000 each. Ordinarily, Pinkerton bills on a relatively cheap hourly basis, but during a state of emergency, the rate soars, something Paz Larach compared to Uber\u2019s surge pricing. By the end of the season, after Maria, Harvey and Irma, Paz Larach told me the company billed tens of millions of dollars.\nHowever bankable and flashy, tactical work is by its nature highly reactive, which has left Pinkerton vulnerable to steep fluctuations in revenue. At the same time, Paz Larach found himself increasingly frustrated by how few businesses took even the simplest of precautions \u2014 generators, stores of water, cameras to prove damage to adjusters. But as he brought these ideas to businesses, he discovered an unexpected drawback to the Pinkerton name: Companies didn\u2019t tend to call for advice; they called because they needed \u201ca guy for a job,\u201d as Paz Larach put it. So over the last five years, as the company watched the demand for incident response skyrocket, it began to pour resources into building three data-and-information-gathering centers: one each in Seattle and The Hague, which focus mainly on crunching big data to predict crime trends worldwide, and a \u201cGlobal Intelligence Center\u201d in Mexico City, which is geared more toward the operational response to those trends.\nThe Mexico City Global Intelligence Center occupies a large wing on the fourth floor of an angular glass building in the neighborhood of Jardines del Pedregal. At the entrance, through double glass doors, I was greeted by an enormous black rendering of the Pinkerton logo and slogan \u2014 \u201cWe never sleep\u201d \u2014 along with framed prints of documents and photographs from the agency\u2019s early days, among them one of Allan Pinkerton standing with President Lincoln, another the rap sheet for Butch Cassidy. The center of the space was dominated by a long white desk, at which several employees, all in black Pinkerton jackets, sat at computers. Behind a biometric scanner lay the operational nerve center of the office, which appeared surprisingly empty. From our conversations, I\u2019d expected a hive of analysts hunched over intricate software displays. But nearly every surface was eerily immaculate, free of any visible sign of stress; at their computers, a handful of analysts browsed Associated Press stories and pecked numbers into Excel. CNN was on. The whole office felt somehow incomplete, as if the company had staged the place in haste.\nPaz Larach and I were met there by David Valenzuela, a former Mexican police officer who looked to still be adjusting to corporate life: He sported a deep blue fatigue shirt, which he\u2019d tucked into his slacks. Valenzuela was in charge of overseeing the analysts who worked there. After scanning into the nerve center, he stood by a screen on the wall, which flashed up a GPS readout of our location. Several separate, smaller frames within the larger one then displayed ticking feeds: Twitter, a news wire, Doppler radar, quick links to police and fire. This was the Pinkerton \u201cthreat monitor\u201d \u2014 quite literally, a monitor.\nMany of the Pinkertons\u2019 tools, including the threat monitor, were originally developed only for internal use \u2014 for an agent tracking a C.E.O. through disputed cartel territory, or keeping an eye on a tanker in waters known for piracy. But over the last few hurricane and wildfire seasons, when storms and blazes began to overtake industrial corridors throughout the Eastern Seaboard and California, the company found that C.E.O.s wanted access to these tools. To sweeten the deal, Pinkerton built out packaged services, including storehouses of food, a threat dashboard for C-suite computers and daily intelligence briefings. Excited by the implications, the company began rolling out an entire conceptual framework around what it called \u201capplied risk science.\u201d\nListening to Paz Larach pitch the agency\u2019s future \u2014 all of it rendered in the gauzy language of consulting \u2014 I was struck by its relative simplicity, which belied, in part, just how far most companies and governments are from accepting the reality of climate change. Even if Pinkerton\u2019s core competency still lies in tactical response, the means of preparation are not exactly the province of big data: Put food in a warehouse, aggregate news, consult the latest open-source modeling. Pinkerton doesn\u2019t even see this strategy as climate-related, per se. The company doesn\u2019t have a dedicated climate division, nor climate experts; from its perspective, that would be redundant. Pinkerton sells safety, or its pretense, in the face of catastrophe, and the only real differences between the catastrophes of this century and the 19th, on some level, will be rate and severity. As Jack Zahran, the president of Pinkerton, put it to me, Pinkerton is a 150-year-old start-up, still pitching the same basic vision: You aren\u2019t prepared enough, and the government is too clumsy to save you.\nLater, at the racetrack, we watched three young men suit up in ski masks to shoot paintballs at our S.U.V. Even among my Pinkerton handlers, the theater of exercise seemed to strain the reasonable connections between tactical response and climate change. Throughout my visit, I wondered whether I had caught Pinkerton in the midst of an awkward organizational transition, or if the company stood merely to capitalize on the world\u2019s growing panic \u2014 and if the difference really mattered. They had, after all, taken me to fire automatic weapons, ostensibly as a training exercise against desperate, disaster-ravaged people. It was impossible to experience that and not project it into a future in which, in the absence of true climate policy or mitigation, capital felt free to protect itself from outside risks \u2014 whatever form they may take.\nDuring one of the long meals that Paz Larach, Rakov, L\u00f3pez Portillo and I shared, the novelty of my being there had faded just enough for them to reflect personally on climate change. The relentless pragmatism of trying to respond to disasters and analyze their occurrence had seemed to leave the men with little space for the existential dread that marks so much of the modern condition. But for whatever reason, on this night, as we picked at a plate of escamoles \u2014 a central-Mexican delicacy of ant larvae \u2014 they spoke about their anxieties.\nL\u00f3pez Portillo, who until then had been jovial if diplomatic in answering my questions, turned solemn, his eyes glancing around the vaulted ceiling. He said he worried about his children, and what sort of world he might be leaving them. But his fear, he clarified, wasn\u2019t exactly that they wouldn\u2019t learn to adapt; it was that he, their father, didn\u2019t know what adaptation would look like. He said that he feared variables he didn\u2019t know how to calculate, variables he couldn\u2019t conceive of yet.\nWhen L\u00f3pez Portillo finished, Paz Larach admitted that thinking that far out was still difficult for him. He was 33 and just married. What the most immediate future held for him was a new home in Miami, where he and his wife had just bought an apartment on the water. It had always been their dream. When I asked him about sea-level rise \u2014 something with which Miami is practically synonymous \u2014 he paused for a moment, then said, \u201cWe know it\u2019s a risk, but we looked at it and decided it was worth it.\u201d And anyway, the apartment wouldn\u2019t be ready until 2021. They\u2019d deal with it then.\nNoah Gallagher Shannon is a writer from northern Colorado who now lives in New York.

Judging whether a practice is \u201cinvasive\u201d isn\u2019t a science, of course. It\u2019s more like a gut feeling, and it depends on how you feel about your own privacy, how much you value strangers\u2019 privacy and the trust you have in corporations and law enforcement.\nBut the results also emphasize a quirk in our digital behavior: People rarely change what they do online, even when they express serious concerns about how their data is used. This is sometimes called the privacy paradox.\n\u201cOne of the reasons people say one thing and do another is they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Lee Rainie, the director of internet and technology research at the Pew Research Center. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re being hypocritical, or that they\u2019re mouthing one thing and immediately dismissing it in another moment. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t actually know.\u201d\nResearchers studying the paradox say internet companies make it hard for users to judge their privacy risks. Users might feel like they have no choice but to use services like email or social networks. The sites might also make it hard to learn about all of their data practices. Facebook, for example, has a lengthy Data Policy, but it\u2019s written so broadly that it's nearly impossible to figure out what exactly they do with your data. Just signing up for a digital service often means consenting to all kinds of data use and collection.\nUnder those conditions, is it surprising people aren\u2019t changing their behavior?\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nTrusting Social Media\nThe paradox is clearest with social media, which has been a focus of privacy concerns for decades. Facebook, for example, has endured a barrage of bad press over the past few years, including the fallout from Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting company harvested information from millions of unsuspecting users to build detailed profiles on voters (a practice it ended in 2015). Even so, Facebook reported late last year that its number of daily active users in the United States and Canada remained steady at 185 million.\nUntil recently, Facebook did a version of many of the practices listed here.\n|Does Facebook do this, or has it?|\n|if you provide it||collects personal information about me|\n|uses friends' posts to send me targeted advertisements|\n|lets companies upload customer lists so they can send me targeted advertising|\n|until April 2018||buys information about me from third parties|\n|on some sites||receives details about my activity from other websites|\n|at some retailers||receives information on what I buy in physical stores|\n|after granting permission||lets third parties download basic information on my friends without their consent|\n|until April 2015 (after granting permission)||lets third parties download information on my friends, like their relationship status and interests, without their consent|\n|it was tested in 2016||serves me targeted ads on a smart TV app that has a relationship with the website|\n|if you enable location services||might know when I walk into into a physical store using the location I share with the phone app|\nSo far, percent of our readers were comfortable with sites collecting personal data. But that doesn\u2019t mean those basic practices come without risk. Agreeing to those basic kinds of data collection enrolls users in Facebook's entire data ecosystem.\nArtificial intelligence \u201ccan make all of these things far worse,\u201d added Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author on a 2018 study about modern surveillance. He said running machine learning \u2014 a branch of artificial intelligence \u2014 on basic information collected by social networks can allow them to \u201cinfer things that I couldn\u2019t even imagine a company could learn.\u201d\nNew Privacy Frontier: DNA\n|Is this already happening?|\n|uses my DNA to offer clues about my genealogy|\n|uses my DNA to determine specific health risks like cancer|\n|uses data from surveys I complete on the site to build a richer profile about me|\n|if you opt in||invites me to participate in pharmaceutical research if my DNA profile matches research needs|\n|if you opt in||sells an analysis of my anonymous/aggregated DNA profile to third parties|\n|if you opt in||uses my DNA profile to conduct research on behalf of pharma companies|\n|if you opt in||sells my anonymous DNA profile to third parties as part of paid research projects|\n|if you opt in||lets customers identify relatives by matching DNA to other customers|\n|lets law enforcement agencies register as users, which lets them look for criminals by matching DNA profiles (without a warrant)|\nGenetic companies like 23andMe and Ancestry analyze customer DNA to provide clues about genealogy and health risks. But the data also offers another potential revenue stream: repackaging it as valuable data for pharmaceutical companies, colleges and researchers.\nBoth 23andMe and Ancestry allow customers to opt into research collaborations with third parties \u2014 relationships the companies say will lead to scientific breakthroughs.\nAncestry said it has no current for-profit ventures and only one nonprofit collaboration with the University of Utah. But in 2015, it partnered with the biotech research company Calico to analyze anonymized data from its trove of genetic samples and, possibly, commercialize their findings.\nThe deal ended last year, and its financial terms were never released.\n23andMe said it\u2019s currently partnering with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and recently collaborated with Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Past collaborations also include Grunenthal, Celmatix, Lundbeck and Milken Institute, and two with Pfizer.\nThe company said the vast majority of their partnerships use de-identified and aggregated data (so it\u2019s pooled with other genetic profiles and summarized, removing identifying information). Other collaborations involved sharing parts of your DNA profile, stripped of additional identifying information like your name. 23andMe emphasized they provide several different opt-ins and consent forms before customers are enrolled. But privacy experts have questioned whether consenting to long documents full of legal terms is the best approach.\n\u201cThe classic notice-and-consent regime that has been the anchor of all kinds of things \u2014 not just online transactions but who\u2019s in medical trials and who is getting what kind of medical treatments \u2013 that regime is a complicated one,\u201d said Mr. Rainie. \u201cEspecially when there are lots of little encounters, lots of little transactions, where a notice-and-consent format might be implicated, people are confused by all of this.\u201d\nIn our poll, percent of readers were comfortable with pharmaceutical companies profiting from their genetic material. Meanwhile, 23andMe said 80 percent of its customers agree to enroll in research during registration, when they see several consent forms in a row. This consent form allows for their de-identified DNA information to be used for research projects, some of them funded by pharmaceutical companies. The company said that the enrollment process was approved by an outside ethics review board.\nContext and Combinations Matter\n|Is this already happening?|\n|in at least some schools||uses facial recognition to match my face against a list of employees in my workplace|\n|planned for a Brooklyn building||checks my face against a database of tenants in my apartment building|\n|tool is being marketed||checks my face against a database of known shoplifters|\n|in a Walgreens pilot||uses facial analysis to determine my age and gender|\n|in a Walgreens pilot||tracks where I look in a store|\n|not in real time||allows police to match my face against a mugshot database|\n|not in real time||allows police to match my faces against a driver's license database|\n|an Israeli company claims to do this||interprets the features on my face to guess other attributes about me|\n|in a pilot project||monitors major roads or bridges 24/7|\n|in the U.K.||lets police departments scan crowds in real time|\n|in New York, according to a news report||watches a subsidized housing project to identify people|\nAll facial recognition practices listed here are happening somewhere in the world today, signalling how A.I. can be combined with video surveillance to create new privacy risks. New York City experimented with using facial recognition on drivers as they crossed bridges and tunnels around Manhattan. And an Israeli startup claims to be able to identify specific attributes like \u201chigh IQ\u201d or \u201cterrorist.\u201d But in most cases, it\u2019s hard to know exactly where and how the burgeoning technology is being used.\n\u201cFor all of these, we know the capability is being advertised, but don't necessarily know if anyone is using the technology for that purpose,\u201d said Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.\nWhile each piece of technology in our poll comes with some privacy risks, the most invasive applications can come when those technologies are used in tandem like this.\nIt\u2019s possible to imagine how combining facial recognition with drones, or connecting it to a citywide network of real-time cameras, could suddenly make the technology far more invasive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the individual collections of online activity that\u2019s the problem,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and author of \u201cData and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the correlation of offline activity, and location, and income estimates, and so on.

Now, investigators are using it to find suspects and witnesses near crimes, running the risk of snaring the innocent.\nWhen detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a murder investigation last December, they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went cold.\nThe police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.\nInvestigators also had other circumstantial evidence, including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic, the same model that Mr. Molina owned, though they could not see the license plate or attacker.\nBut after he spent nearly a week in jail, the case against Mr. Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him. Last month, the police arrested another man: his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who had sometimes used Mr. Molina\u2019s car.\nThe warrants, which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault, turn the business of tracking cellphone users\u2019 locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement. In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies, it is just the latest example of how personal information \u2014 where you go, who your friends are, what you read, eat and watch, and when you do it \u2014 is being used for purposes many people never expected. As privacy concerns have mounted among consumers, policymakers and regulators, tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practices.\nThe Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique, whose use has risen sharply in the past six months, according to Google employees familiar with the requests. It can help solve crimes. But it can also snare innocent people.\nTechnology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users\u2019 information. The new warrants go further, suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues. Often, Google employees said, the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devices.\nLaw enforcement officials described the method as exciting, but cautioned that it was just one tool.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pop out the answer like a ticker tape, saying this guy\u2019s guilty,\u201d said Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington State who has worked on several cases involving these warrants. Potential suspects must still be fully investigated, he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were there.\u201d\nIt is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions, because many of the investigations are still open and judges frequently seal the warrants. The practice was first used by federal agents in 2016, according to Google employees, and first publicly reported last year in North Carolina. It has since spread to local departments across the country, including in California, Florida, Minnesota and Washington. This year, one Google employee said, the company received as many as 180 requests in one week. Google declined to confirm precise numbers.\nThe technique illustrates a phenomenon privacy advocates have long referred to as the \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d principle \u2014 anytime a technology company creates a system that could be used in surveillance, law enforcement inevitably comes knocking. Sensorvault, according to Google employees, includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decade.\nThe new orders, sometimes called \u201cgeofence\u201d warrants, specify an area and a time period, and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there. It labels them with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the users\u2019 names and other information.\n\u2018\u2018There are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked \u2014 and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case, that should give everybody serious pause,\u201d said Catherine Turner, a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the technique.\nInvestigators who spoke with The New York Times said they had not sent geofence warrants to companies other than Google, and Apple said it did not have the ability to perform those searches. Google would not provide details on Sensorvault, but Aaron Edens, an intelligence analyst with the sheriff\u2019s office in San Mateo County, Calif., who has examined data from hundreds of phones, said most Android devices and some iPhones he had seen had this data available from Google.\nIn a statement, Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to \u201cvigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement.\u201d He added that it handed over identifying information only \u201cwhere legally required.\u201d\nMr. Molina, 24, said he was shocked when the police told him they suspected him of murder, and he was surprised at their ability to arrest him based largely on data.\n\u201cI just kept thinking, You\u2019re innocent, so you\u2019re going to get out,\u201d he said, but he added that he worried that it could take months or years to be exonerated. \u201cI was scared,\u201d he said.\nA Novel Approach\nDetectives have used the warrants for help with robberies, sexual assaults, arsons and murders. Last year, federal agents requested the data to investigate a string of bombings around Austin, Tex.\nRich Harris / The New York Times\nAustin investigators obtained another warrant after a fourth bomb exploded. But the suspect killed himself three days after that bomb, as they were closing in. Officials at the time said surveillance video and receipts for suspicious purchases helped identify him.\nAn F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the response from Google was helpful or timely, saying that any question about the technique \u201ctouches on areas we don\u2019t discuss.\u201d\nOfficers who have used the warrants said they showed promise in finding suspects as well as witnesses who may have been near the crime without realizing it. The searches may also be valuable in cold cases. A warrant last year in Florida, for example, sought information on a murder from 2016. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the data was helpful.\nThe approach has yielded useful information even if it wasn\u2019t what broke the case open, investigators said. In a home invasion in Minnesota, for example, Google data showed a phone taking the path of the likely intruder, according to a news report and police documents. But detectives also cited other leads, including a confidential informant, in developing suspects. Four people were charged in federal court.\nAccording to several current and former Google employees, the Sensorvault database was not designed for the needs of law enforcement, raising questions about its accuracy in some situations.\nThough Google\u2019s data cache is enormous, it doesn\u2019t sweep up every phone, said Mr. Edens, the California intelligence analyst. And even if a location is recorded every few minutes, that may not coincide with a shooting or an assault.\nGoogle often doesn\u2019t provide information right away, investigators said. The Google unit handling the requests has struggled to keep up, so it can take weeks or months for a response. In the Arizona investigation, police received data six months after sending the warrant. In a different Minnesota case this fall, it came in four weeks.\nBut despite the drawbacks, detectives noted how precise the data was and how it was collected even when people weren\u2019t making calls or using apps \u2014 both improvements over tracking that relies on cell towers.\n\u201cIt shows the whole pattern of life,\u201d said Mark Bruley, the deputy police chief in Brooklyn Park, Minn., where investigators have been using the technique since this fall. \u201cThat\u2019s the game changer for law enforcement.\u201d\nA Trove of Data\nLocation data is a lucrative business \u2014 and Google is by far the biggest player, propelled largely by its Android phones. It uses the data to power advertising tailored to a person\u2019s location, part of a more than $20 billion market for location-based ads last year.\nIn 2009, the company introduced Location History, a feature for users who wanted to see where they had been. Sensorvault stores information on anyone who has opted in, allowing regular collection of data from GPS signals, cellphone towers, nearby Wi-Fi devices and Bluetooth beacons.\nPeople who turn on the feature can see a timeline of their activity and get recommendations based on it. Google apps prompt users to enable Location History for things like traffic alerts. Information in the database is held indefinitely, unless the user deletes it.\n\u201cWe citizens are giving this stuff away,\u201d said Mr. Ernsdorff, the Washington State prosecutor, adding that if companies were collecting data, law enforcement should be able to obtain a court order to use it.\nCurrent and former Google employees said they were surprised by the warrants. Brian McClendon, who led the development of Google Maps and related products until 2015, said he and other engineers had assumed the police would seek data only on specific people. The new technique, he said, \u201cseems like a fishing expedition.\u201d\nUncharted Legal Territory\nThe practice raises novel legal issues, according to Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on criminal law in the digital age.\nOne concern: the privacy of innocent people scooped up in these searches. Several law enforcement officials said the information remained sealed in their jurisdictions but not in every state.\nIn Minnesota, for example, the name of an innocent man was released to a local journalist after it became part of the police record. Investigators had his information because he was within 170 feet of a burglary. Reached by a reporter, the man said he was surprised about the release of his data and thought he might have appeared because he was a cabdriver. \u201cI drive everywhere,\u201d he said.\nThese searches also raise constitutional questions. The Fourth Amendment says a warrant must request a limited search and establish probable cause that evidence related to a crime will be found.\nWarrants reviewed by The Times frequently established probable cause by explaining that most Americans owned cellphones and that Google held location data on many of these phones. The areas they targeted ranged from single buildings to multiple blocks, and most sought data over a few hours. In the Austin case, warrants covered several dozen houses around each bombing location, for times ranging from 12 hours to a week. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Google responded to all the requests, and multiple officials said they had seen the company push back on broad searches.\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant was required for historical data about a person\u2019s cellphone location over weeks, but the court has not ruled on anything like geofence searches, including a technique that pulls information on all phones registered to a cell tower.\nGoogle\u2019s legal staff decided even before the 2018 ruling that the company would require warrants for location inquiries, and it crafted the procedure that first reveals only anonymous data.\n\u201cNormally we think of the judiciary as being the overseer, but as the technology has gotten more complex, courts have had a harder and harder time playing that role,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWe\u2019re depending on companies to be the intermediary between people and the government.\u201d\nIn several cases reviewed by The Times, a judge approved the entire procedure in a single warrant, relying on investigators\u2019 assurances that they would seek data for only the most relevant devices. Google responds to those orders, but Mr. Kerr said it was unclear whether multistep warrants should pass legal muster.\nSome jurisdictions require investigators to return to a judge and obtain a second warrant before getting identifying information. With another warrant, investigators can obtain more extensive data, including months of location patterns and even emails.\nMixed Results\nInvestigators in Arizona have never publicly disclosed a likely motive in the killing of Joseph Knight, the crime for which Mr. Molina was arrested. In a court document, they described Mr. Knight, a 29-year-old aircraft repair company employee, as having no known history of drug use or gang activity.\nDetectives sent the geofence warrant to Google soon after the murder and received data from four devices months later. One device, a phone Google said was linked to Mr. Molina\u2019s account, appeared to follow the path of the gunman\u2019s car as seen on video. His carrier also said the phone was associated with a tower in roughly the same area, and his Google history showed a search about local shootings the day after the attack.\nAfter his arrest, Mr. Molina told officers that Marcos Gaeta, his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, had sometimes taken his car. The Times found a traffic ticket showing that Mr. Gaeta, 38, had driven that car without a license. Mr. Gaeta also had a lengthy criminal record.\nWhile Mr. Molina was in jail, a friend told his public defender, Jack Litwak, that she was with him at his home about the time of the shooting, and she and others provided texts and Uber receipts to bolster his case. His home, where he lives with his mother and three siblings, is about two miles from the murder scene.\nMr. Litwak said his investigation found that Mr. Molina had sometimes signed in to other people\u2019s phones to check his Google account. That could lead someone to appear in two places at once, though it was not clear whether that happened in this case.\nMr. Gaeta was arrested in California on an Arizona warrant. He was then charged in a separate California homicide from 2016. Officials said that case would probably delay his extradition to Arizona.\nA police spokesman said \u201cnew information came to light\u201d after Mr. Molina\u2019s arrest, but the department would not comment further.\nMonths after his release, Mr. Molina was having trouble getting back on his feet. After being arrested at work, a Macy\u2019s warehouse, he lost his job. His car was impounded for investigation and then repossessed.\nThe investigators \u201chad good intentions\u201d in using the technique, Mr. Litwak said. But, he added, \u201cthey\u2019re hyping it up to be this new DNA type of forensic evidence, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "tags": [{"label": "murders and attempted murders", "score": "0.92860"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.52250"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.43718"}, {"label": "serial murders", "score": "0.13877"}, {"label": "robberies and thefts", "score": "0.07643"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.07512"}, {"label": "police", "score": "0.06489"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.06253"}, {"label": "kidnapping", "score": "0.06101"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.05824"}, {"label": "telephones and telecommunications", "score": "0.03832"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.03694"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.02924"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.02772"}, {"label": "firearms", "score": "0.02725"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.02438"}, {"label": "identification devices", "score": "0.02208"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.02164"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.02113"}, {"label": "privacy", "score": "0.02024"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.01988"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01925"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.01348"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.01304"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.01158"}, {"label": "organized crime", "score": "0.01008"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.00978"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.00951"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.00916"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.00908"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Phoenix", "Arizona", "Washington State", "North Carolina", "California", "Florida", "Minnesota", "Washington", "Minnesota", "San Mateo County", "Calif.", "Austin", "Tex.", "Austin", "Florida", "Minnesota", "California", "Arizona", "Minnesota", "Brooklyn Park", "Minn.", "Washington State", "Minnesota", "Arizona", "California", "Arizona", "California", "Arizona"], "ORG": ["The New York Times", "Google", "Google", "Honda", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "The New York Times", "Google", "Apple", "Google", "Android", "Google", "Google", "The New York Times", "F.B.I.", "Google", "A Florida Department of Law Enforcement", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Android", "Location History", "Google", "Google", "Google Maps", "Uncharted Legal Territory", "the University of Southern California", "Times", "Google", "Google", "the Supreme Court", "Google", "the American Civil Liberties Union", "Times", "Google", "Detectives", "Google", "Google", "Google", "Times", "Uber", "Google", "Macy"], "PERSON": ["Alex Welsh", "Jorge Molina", "Molina", "Molina", "Molina", "Sensorvault", "Gary Ernsdorff", "Sensorvault", "Sensorvault", "Catherine Turner", "Sensorvault", "Aaron Edens", "Richard Salgado", "Molina", "Rich Harris", "Sensorvault", "Edens", "Mark Bruley", "Sensorvault", "Ernsdorff", "Brian McClendon", "Orin Kerr", "Austin", "Jennifer Granick", "Kerr", "Joseph Knight", "Molina", "Knight", "Molina", "Molina", "Marcos Gaeta", "Gaeta", "Gaeta", "Molina", "Jack Litwak", "Litwak", "Molina", "Gaeta", "Molina", "Molina", "Litwak"]}}, {"index": 224, "year": 2019, "title": "We Built an \u2018Unbelievable\u2019 (but Legal) Facial Recognition Machine", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/16/opinion/facial-recognition-new-york-city.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "text_content": "On the east side of Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, three cameras on the roof of a restaurant film the lunch crowds, tourists and commuters \u2014 everything that goes on each day. The feeds are streamed publicly online.\nWe were able to turn those cameras into a facial recognition-powered tracking system for less than $100 \u2014 using a service available to anyone with an internet connection and a credit card. The process was completely legal.\nHow easy would it be to figure out who was in the park? We built a database using public photos of people who work in the area and matched this college professor on his way to lunch. All it took was a few days\u2019 work.\nThe cameras are just three among thousands across New York City. And if you\u2019re an adult in America, there\u2019s more than a 50 percent chance that you\u2019re already in a law enforcement facial recognition database, according to researchers at Georgetown.\nMost people pass through some type of public space in their daily routine \u2014 sidewalks, roads, train stations. Thousands walk through Bryant Park every day. But we generally think that a detailed log of our location, and a list of the people we\u2019re with, is private. Facial recognition, applied to the web of cameras that already exists in most cities, is a threat to that privacy.\nTo demonstrate how easy it is to track people without their knowledge, we collected public images of people who worked near Bryant Park (available on their employers\u2019 websites, for the most part) and ran one day of footage through Amazon\u2019s commercial facial recognition service. Our system detected 2,750 faces from a nine-hour period (not necessarily unique people, since a person could be captured in multiple frames). It returned several possible identifications, including one frame matched to a head shot of Richard Madonna, a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry, with an 89 percent similarity score. The total cost: about $60.\n\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018Oh my god, that is unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Dr. Madonna said, after we reached him and explained the experiment. \u201cI was shocked at how readily it seems that it picked me up, because, really \u2014 it\u2019s the side of my head.\u201d\nIn our exercise, we built a database using only photos from public websites, and we obtained Dr. Madonna\u2019s consent before publishing this story. We\u2019ve deleted the images and data that we collected and are no longer monitoring the Bryant Park cameras.\nOver decades, businesses and individuals have installed millions of cameras like the ones we used, inadvertently setting up the infrastructure for mass surveillance. In the past, a human would have to watch the video feed to identify people, making it impossible to comprehensively record everyone\u2019s movements. But the accuracy and speed of modern facial recognition technology means that building a dragnet surveillance system is now feasible.\nThe law has not caught up. In the United States, the use of facial recognition is almost wholly unregulated.\n\u201cThe technology has advanced faster than even I thought that it would,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She said that because of how quickly the technology has advanced, she would now support a wholesale ban on government use of facial recognition.\nThe cameras in Bryant Park were installed more than a decade ago so that people could see whether the lawn was open for sunbathing, for example, or check how busy the ice skating rink was in the winter. They are not intended to be a security device, according to the corporation that runs the park.\nBut our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people\u2019s daily habits: when they arrive at the office each day, who they get coffee with, whether they left work early. When we identified Dr. Madonna, he was on his way to lunch with a job candidate \u2014 an example of how the midday outings of even law-abiding citizens can sometimes be sensitive information.\nThe police and governments may also have access to a vast network of cameras. Combine that with a comprehensive database of faces \u2014 like a driver\u2019s license database \u2014 and it\u2019s possible to track citizens throughout an entire region in real time. There is no evidence that this is happening on a wide scale in the United States. But that\u2019s not because the technology doesn\u2019t exist. Last year, companies claimed they could compare live feeds to a database of billions of faces.\nAuthorities have used facial recognition to track down criminal suspects and find missing children. But civil liberties advocates warn about the chilling effect on free speech if the government could monitor everyone\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 or, say, identify individuals at a protest. This is not a purely hypothetical concern: During 2016 protests after Freddie Gray died in the custody of Baltimore police, law enforcement used facial recognition on social media images to identify protesters with outstanding warrants.\n\"Once the government has the ability to track us and identify us wherever we go, it is impossible to speak and participate in society anonymously,\" Ms. Lynch said.\nFacial recognition in New York City\nNew York City is nowhere near China, where the government has installed approximately one surveillance camera for every seven citizens. But according to the A.C.L.U., police here have access to more than 9,000 camera feeds in Lower Manhattan alone.\nThe M.T.A. has tried using facial recognition on feeds from license-plate cameras at the city\u2019s entry points to identify drivers through their windshields, although those efforts have been unsuccessful so far, according to The Wall Street Journal. And the Department of Transportation already has hundreds of cameras across New York City used to monitor traffic, feeds that are also streamed publicly online.\nThe traffic cameras are most likely too low-resolution for effective facial recognition. But the city\u2019s LinkNYC kiosks, which are scattered through the streets and intended to provide free wireless internet, each have two security cameras. Law enforcement agencies need a subpoena or court order to gain access to the footage, and using facial recognition is against the policy of the company that owns the kiosks. However, the existence of more than 3,000 additional cameras has raised concerns about their potential to bolster the city\u2019s surveillance capabilities.\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nTraffic camera\nManhattan\nqueens\nBrooklyn\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nManhattan\nTraffic camera\nBrooklyn\nDetails are sparse, but there is evidence that those capabilities are formidable. The Police Department claims its Domain Awareness System, developed jointly with Microsoft (which also offers facial recognition software), \u201cutilizes the largest network of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological sensors in the world.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Domain Awareness System currently uses facial recognition, though the Police Department experimented with it in 2012, according to Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School. The police have been reluctant to divulge details, and the center has sued the department for more information.\n\u201cWe compare facial images picked up by cameras at crime scenes to mugshots in law enforcement records,\u201d said Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the department, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe do not engage in mass or random collection of facial records from N.Y.P.D. camera systems, the internet, or social media.\u201d\nLaw enforcement use of the technology\nAmazon is one of several companies that sell facial recognition services to the public. The company has highlighted positive applications of the service we used, Rekognition, such as its ability to help find lost children. It insists that it requires customers comply with the law and respect others\u2019 rights, but has been criticized for pushing its technology to law enforcement agencies.\nRekognition is already actively used by the sheriff\u2019s office in Washington County, Ore., including to investigate minor crimes like shoplifting. The Orlando, Fla., Police Department is also using the technology in a pilot program.\nAmazon notes that its service makes predictions, not decisions, and that the confidence level the service provides should be incorporated in a human review process. The company recommends using a threshold of at least 99 percent for applications of its facial recognition service that involve identification or public safety, though critics of the technology say that the scoring is opaque and that the company has no way of enforcing that threshold. None of the matches we obtained from the Bryant Park footage, correct or incorrect, met the threshold.\nMatt Wood, the general manager of artificial intelligence for Amazon Web Services, noted that it is possible that Rekognition, like other types of information available to law enforcement officials, could be used inappropriately. \u201cThe law enforcement agency will have to be accountable to these individuals and to the law if they violate people\u2019s civil liberties,\u201d he said. He added that the company has not received any reports of misuse by law enforcement.\nIn January, however, the A.C.L.U. sent a letter to Amazon asking it to stop selling facial recognition technology to police and government agencies, saying that the company\u2019s attention to civil liberties has lagged behind that of Google and Microsoft.\n\u201cRekognition marketing materials read like a user manual for authoritarian surveillance,\u201d said Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director for the A.C.L.U. of California, in a statement last year.\nRegulate or ban?\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws that restrict the use of facial recognition. Most states don\u2019t have regulations (exceptions include Illinois and Texas), nor does New York City, though a city councilman proposed legislation last year that would require businesses to disclose their use of the technology. That would apply to our exercise, but would not extend to law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a wild, wild west out there,\u201d Ms. Lynch, the E.F.F. lawyer, said.\nThe lack of regulation has opened the door to a wide range of applications. In 2007, an Arizona sheriff\u2019s office enrolled all of Honduras\u2019s driver\u2019s licenses and mugshots into its database, and a Florida sheriff\u2019s office runs 8,000 searches each month without requiring its officers to have reasonable suspicion of a crime, according to the Georgetown report.\nThe Georgetown center along with the E.F.F. and others have proposed regulations, including requiring that authorities have reasonable suspicion before conducting a search; prohibiting, except in life-or-death situations, live facial recognition searches using driver\u2019s license databases; and forbidding tracking individuals based on political beliefs, race or religion.\nAmazon itself has called for a legal framework that incorporates human review and transparency. But some say that the technology is so dangerous that no regulation is sufficient.\n\u201cThe future of human flourishing depends upon facial recognition technology being banned,\u201d wrote Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern, and Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, last year. \u201cOtherwise, people won\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in public without being automatically identified, profiled, and potentially exploited.\u201d\nFacial recognition is categorically different from other forms of surveillance, Mr. Hartzog said, and uniquely dangerous. Faces are hard to hide and can be observed from far away, unlike a fingerprint. Name and face databases of law-abiding citizens, like driver\u2019s license records, already exist. And for the most part, facial recognition surveillance can be set up using cameras already on the streets.\nIt might be too late for a moratorium or ban, however. Facial recognition is already being used by police departments around the country, Ms. Garvie said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lock law enforcement agencies into 20th-century technology just because 21st-century technology raises very serious risks,\u201d she said.\nDr. Madonna, the person we identified, said he understood that tension. He was initially astonished when we reached out to him, but he said that as a doctor, he often talks to students about the ratio of risk to benefit. He saw the tremendous benefits that facial recognition could offer, he said.\nBut the technology is open to abuse, he added, when individuals or governments can use facial recognition to track any group, or just about any ordinary citizen \u2014 even someone walking through Bryant Park.\nDesigned by Jessia Ma.

These digital ads are powered by vast, hidden datasets that allow advertisers to make eerily accurate guesses about who you are, where you\u2019ve been, how you feel and what you might do next.\nWhile targeted ads may be familiar by now, how they work \u2014 and the power they have \u2014 often seems invisible.\nWe decided to lift the veil on this part of the internet economy, so we bought some ad space. We picked 16 categories (like registered Democrats or people trying to lose weight) and targeted ads at people in them. But instead of trying to sell cars or prescription drugs, we used the ads to reveal the invisible information itself.\nHere\u2019s what one ad looked like. The underlined text below shows what the ad knows about the person who\u2019s seeing it.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThe second frame of the ad:\nThis was an experiment in how far digital advertisers go to collect and use information about every part of our lives for profit. But it\u2019s also the story of how our information is used not just to target us but to manipulate others for economic and political ends \u2014 invisibly, and in ways that are difficult to scrutinize or even question. And it\u2019s a warning sign about the real-world political risks that come from this sophisticated guessing game, which is played in billions of transactions each day.\n\u201cThe way ads are targeted today is radically different from the way it was done 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d said Frederike Kaltheuner, who heads the corporate exploitation program at Privacy International. \u201cIt\u2019s become exponentially more invasive, and most people are completely unaware of what kinds of data feeds into the targeting.\u201d\nWith that in mind, we want to share how we targeted these ads, what we learned, and why it might disturb you.\nThe narrowest slices of the Internet\nTargeted advertising was once limited to simple contextual cues: visiting ESPN probably meant you\u2019d see an ad for Nike. But advertising services today use narrow categories drawn from a mind-boggling number of sources to single out consumers. (Like many publishers, The Times uses targeted advertising to find potential subscribers and readers.)\nTo build the ads for our experiment, we imagined some extremely specific targets and built profiles of those people. Then we chose 16 attributes that matched those profiles from a list of about 30,000 \u2014 a list that\u2019s rarely seen by people outside the industry.\nWe could do this because many companies, like retailers and credit card providers, sell customer information to data companies. Most data providers declined to tell us where their data comes from or how they built their models, so the sources in the ads below come from the ad experts who helped us create the campaign. Our experiment would have been blocked on Facebook because the company bans most ads showing how you\u2019ve been targeted.\nHere are more sample ads that we bought as part of our experiment. (These ads, like all the ads shown in this story, aren\u2019t live and don\u2019t show data about you specifically.)\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male, actively\nconsolidating your debt and are a high\nspender at luxury department stores.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nactively consolidating your\ndebt and are a high spender\nat luxury department stores.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re trying to\nlose weight but still love bakeries.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re trying to\nlose weight but still\nlove bakeries.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card\nBut that\u2019s just the start. Launching a political campaign \u2014 or trying to interfere with one? You could target potential political converts:\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re female, a\nregistered Democrat and are likely to\nvote for the sitting president.\nlikely voter registration\nlikely browsing history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re\nfemale, a registered\nDemocrat and are likely to\nvote for the sitting president.\nlikely voting registration\nlikely browsing history\n\u201cIn the next election, I think it is inevitable that every single voter will have been profiled based on what they have been reading, watching and listening to for years online,\u201d said Johnny Ryan, the chief policy officer at Brave, a private web browser that allows users to block ads and trackers.\nCompanies can target by location, too. It\u2019s possible to single out bankers on Wall Street or political aides on Capitol Hill. If you wanted to target any specific location, you could find an ad platform that could do it (but the accuracy would vary depending on the technology used).\nIt\u2019s not limited to what advertisers know about your past behavior, either. Data providers claim they can predict things you didn\u2019t directly disclose, including what you\u2019ll do in the future. They don\u2019t have your voting history, but they can still guess whether you\u2019re a likely liberal or a likely conservative. They also say they know whether you\u2019re planning a foreign vacation in the next year.\n\u201cSurveillance companies are learning to nudge, coax, tune and herd human behavior in the direction that they want people to go for the sake of the commercial outcomes that their business customers seek,\u201d said Shoshana Zuboff, Harvard Business School professor emerita and author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\u201d\nPredictions about who people are and what they will buy offer the most promise to advertisers because they enable targeting nearly everyone, even those with little data available.\nAcxiom, a major marketing data company, said it makes predictions by comparing specific people to a much larger group. For example, it might predict whether you\u2019ll buy an S.U.V. by looking at people who did buy S.U.V.s, then checking whether you live in a similar region, or whether you\u2019re around the same age and share similar interests. If you\u2019re similar, they\u2019ll put you in a bucket that says you\u2019re highly likely to buy an S.U.V. And if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s buying the S.U.V., your characteristics might be used to refine the pool of potential future S.U.V. buyers.\n\u201cThose predictive models and those audiences are defined by the simple principle of \u2018birds of a feather flock together,\u2019\u201d said Chad Engelgau, chief strategy and marketing officer at Acxiom. He added that prediction categories are used when data companies don\u2019t have more specific data, so they might guess the likelihood that you\u2019re a parent who needs to buy diapers using a predictive category rather than learning directly by collecting new birth records.\n\u201cNobody in the industry is saying this is a fact,\u201d he said of the predictions. \u201cIt\u2019s used to create efficiencies.\u201d\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nThe accuracy of predictions made by data providers is difficult to verify. The companies release little evidence that those included in these groups actually belong there. A study from 2018 found that the gender assigned by data brokers was accurate, on average, only 42 percent of the time \u2014 that\u2019s worse than just flipping a coin. So in the ads we bought, we expected many men would see ads aimed at women and vice versa.\nAcxiom said it\u2019s working on adding more transparency to its models, including better labeling and third-party audits. It has also joined many other data companies calling for federal regulation that would place limits on how data is collected and shared while leaving room for marketing purposes. But such a law could also weaken or replace much more aggressive state regulations, like California\u2019s data protection law.\nData providers also say the information stored and shared is anonymous, but that doesn\u2019t mean it stays that way. In 2017, for example, German researchers tied data that was supposedly anonymous back to specific individuals. They found revealing things like the medication used by a German politician and a German judge\u2019s use of pornography.\nWhere the data comes from\nToday\u2019s data providers can receive information from almost every imaginable part of your life: your activity on the internet, the places you visit, the stores you walk through, the things you buy, the things you like, who your friends are, the places your friends go, the things your friends do, and on and on. One provider boasts about having \u201cprecise second-by-second viewing of tens of millions of televisions in all 210 local markets across the country.\u201d If you responded to an online event invitation, the details could be used to target you. If you\u2019re listening to energetic music, you could be targeted almost instantly in an energetic mood group. Much of this data could be shared among brands.\nYou might find targeted ads preferable to general ones since there\u2019s a better chance that you might actually want to buy the products being marketed. But privacy advocates say targeting has gotten out of control.\n\u201cDo you really need to track people on all the websites they visit, every single app they use, on their entire platform, and keep the data for a shockingly long time?\u201d asked Ms. Kaltheuner, from Privacy International. \u201cIs all of this really necessary to show relevant ads?\u201d\nAds in our experiment combined data from many of these sources.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nwork in media,\nand cut the cable cord.\nLIKELY credit card\nLIKELY work email\nLIKELY social media\nLIKELY smart home devices\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nwork in media,\nand cut the cable cord.\nLikely work email\nLikely\ncredit card\nLikely social media\nLikely smart\nhome devices\nJust by browsing the web, you\u2019re sending valuable data to trackers and ad platforms. Websites can also provide marketers specific things they know about you, like your date of birth or email address.\nAd companies often identify you when you load a website using trackers and cookies \u2014 small files containing information about you. Then your data is shared with multiple advertisers who bid to fill the ad space. The winning bid gets to fill the ad slot.\nAll of this happens in milliseconds.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re a\ncybersecurity expert, female\nand go to art events in the desert.\nLIKELY browsing history\nLIKELY browsing history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re a\ncybersecurity expert,\nfemale and go to art\nevents in the desert.\nLIKELY browsing history\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male, a C-suite\nexecutive and binge-watch reality\ndating shows.\nlikely work email\nlikely Smart TV\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\na C-suite executive and\nbinge-watch reality\ndating shows.\nlikely work email\nlikely Smart TV\nDr. Zuboff, the author and professor, argues that companies today are mining private lives the same way they exploit natural resources, turning them into profitable goods.

Beijing disabled Xinjiang\u2019s internet, sending military police to restore order. The blackout lasted nearly a year. Now, a decade later, Xinjiang is writhing under a new clampdown aimed at the Uighurs. This time, Beijing has embraced the opposite philosophy: a digital panopticon, enlisting private tech firms to expand China\u2019s internet of things and enmesh its own people.\nThe technologies being honed in Xinjiang, driven by this kind of illiberal innovation, may be coming soon to an app store near you. These exports risk enabling aspiring autocrats worldwide, and may concentrate alarming power in the hands of China\u2019s Communist Party.\nUntil recently, China was dismissed as an innovation laggard that copied technology from the West. Today, many Chinese tech sectors have leapfrogged Silicon Valley, sometimes with heavy-handed help from the party. Consumer-friendly smartphone apps have pushed cash, credit cards and identification documents toward extinction. Hotel booking systems will ping your smartphone, linked to your national ID card, to let you check in using facial recognition. In under a minute, a mom-and-pop hardware kiosk can create a personalized QR code for cashless payments through WeChat, an indispensable app that combines the functions of WhatsApp, Venmo, Seamless, Uber and more. For an expatriate accustomed to China\u2019s freewheeling start-up scene and whizzy tech conveniences, coming home can feel like stepping back in time.\nBut, as the Uighur minority of Xinjiang are learning, that convenience comes at an Orwellian price. Speedy data networks and integrated digital commerce are learning to work with the party\u2019s aggressive security apparatus. Invasive DNA databases and facial recognition powered by artificial intelligence have created a digital dragnet, enhanced by mandatory surveillance apps installed on smartphones and backed by a newly built network of IRL gulags. Offenses as trivial as forwarding a traditional Islamic holiday greeting on WeChat, or posting a bearded selfie, can land citizens in internment camps. Even Uighurs living abroad are entangled, through their families and their smartphones, in Beijing\u2019s crackdown. (The repression has reportedly created a black market in old Nokia phones, which are less legible to the state.)\nXinjiang\u2019s plight is more than a local tragedy: It is a warning.\nThe global risk from China\u2019s technology sector is not necessarily a sinister conspiracy to exert Xinjiang-style controls overseas. Beijing\u2019s leaders are focused on domestic affairs and for now, China\u2019s budding tech dystopia is still more \u201cBrazil\u201d than \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Rather, this risk is a byproduct of Beijing\u2019s business as usual, on a huge global scale.\nProducts created for China\u2019s vast surveilled and censored domestic market are increasingly popular overseas, where they are often cheaper and more appealing to consumers. Huawei, for instance, has honed its 5G wireless technology \u2014 which will support the next generation of data-intensive, A.I.-powered gadgets \u2014 in China\u2019s domestic, bleeding-edge consumer market for the internet of things. Many Huawei phones are bought by Chinese who have never owned a PC or other digital device, giving the company an edge in imagining and designing mobile products for developing markets that skipped over the PC era. Huawei\u2019s cheaper (and often subsidized) price points, and comparable or superior products, have made its phones a better-value purchase than the iPhone for cost-savvy consumers around the world, and its 5G infrastructure attractive for penny-pinching governments. Most are unaware, or apparently unconcerned, about censorship or surveillance.\nThey should be worried. According to the Soviet-style playbook that still influences Chinese security services, collecting haystacks of citizen information, by whatever means necessary, is the foundation of social control and \u201cstability maintenance.\u201d\nThe Soviet model was an analog blend of Big Brother and big data, amassing reams of information about citizens to understand their fears, vulnerabilities and intentions, and pre-empt any challenge to the Party-State\u2019s power. China has adapted this paranoid style to the modern tech age. Private corporations and the Communist Party\u2019s security apparatus have grown together, discovering how the same data sets can both cater to consumers and help commissars calibrate repression.\nThe party\u2019s instinctual contempt for privacy, married to its proactive industrial policy, can be a boon for well-connected private businesses. Many tech firms make a point of hiring the relatives of high party officials, and a vast state database of headshots might be shared with a private firm to train new facial recognition software, while the firm\u2019s trove of real-time user data might be offered to police, for a panoramic view of potential \u201ctroublemakers.\u201d\nBetween the Communist Party\u2019s repressive impulses, its influence over China\u2019s vast and innovative tech ecosystem, and new technology\u2019s general propensity to disrupt and surprise, it is na\u00efve to expect that we can fully anticipate and mitigate the impact of illiberal innovations exported abroad. Even innocuous-seeming technology, when paired with China\u2019s authoritarian impulses and state-led development model, may challenge liberal values in unexpected ways.\nConsider TikTok, a social video-sharing app that last year had more downloads on the Apple app store than Instagram. TikTok fills a market niche abandoned by Vine, the American-grown short-video-sharing app shuttered by Twitter in 2017. Users can upload videos of themselves or friends lip-synching the latest pop tunes or decorating or distorting their faces, all easily edited into a clip for other users to \u201clike,\u201d \u201cshare\u201d or comment on.\nTo China\u2019s surveillance state, a video-sharing app offers much more than than your dog dancing to Drake. TikTok\u2019s domestic Chinese version, Douyin, is heavily censored and surveilled: Last year, the British cartoon Peppa Pig was purged from the platform after the authorities decided she had taken on subversive meaning. (It is unclear whether this was because of a direct government order or the company pre-emptively censoring itself.)\nFor residents of Xinjiang, posting a video of traditional Uighur music sung in their native language might be flagged by machine-learning algorithms, and bring a deletion and a visit from the police. In what appear to be precautionary performances of loyalty to the government, Uighur users of Douyin have recorded themselves singing pro-party songs, pointedly in Mandarin. Given the wide use of facial recognition across Xinjiang, and the potential sharing of security data sets between state agencies and private firms, Douyin\u2019s raw video data may also offer a tempting training set for machine-learning software. (Recent leaks have shown China\u2019s developing capability to match GPS coordinates with Uighur facial recognition data; with help from a Yale professor and an American biotech firm, Thermo Fisher, China has also built a database of Uighur DNA.)\nTo date, no evidence suggests that Chinese authorities have used their leverage over Douyin domestically to censor or surveil TikTok overseas. But given what we know about Beijing\u2019s illiberal impulses, there is a gap between what is provable beforehand, and what it is prudent to presume. The brazen lying that is normalized in China\u2019s corporate and political culture, and the meaninglessness of written rules, mean that published regulations, or guarantees by private firms and government officials, are simply not credible. (Just ask Prof. Kenneth Kidd, the geneticist at Yale who accepted assurances from his Chinese counterparts that DNA samples for their joint project would be ethically obtained. Dr. Kidd claimed to be shocked \u2014 shocked \u2014 to discover that the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s sweet nothings can\u2019t be taken at face value. His credulous negligence has tainted a Yale DNA database; future generations may remember Thermo Fischer among corporate collaborationists like I.B.M. and Bayer.)\nTikTok itself has already been fined by the Federal Trade Commission for a casual attitude toward privacy compliance; its heavy-handed solution, mass deletions, enraged some consumers. But the choices of ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, are rational; it fears the Communist Party more than angry tweets from tweens outside the Great Firewall.\nThe West\u2019s increasing technological and economic exposure to China may have unintended consequences. Over a decade ago, the singer Bj\u00f6rk was banned from China, and muzzled within the Great Firewall, for advocating Tibetan independence during a concert in Shanghai. If, tomorrow, Bj\u00f6rk followed up with a TikTok video pleading for Uighur rights, and the clip went viral globally, would the party be able to resist the temptation to lean on ByteDance to slow or stop it? If your face appears in the background of another person\u2019s TikTok video shot in Berlin, will it be logged using facial recognition software running in Shanghai? Those who complain that American firms like Facebook are invasive and unaccountable are unlikely to prefer China\u2019s tech giants, which are often cowed by, and collaborating with, the Party-State\u2019s opaque and irascible censorship and surveillance apparatus.\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nTo be sure, the United States has abused its own technological hegemony for power and profit. After World War II, much global communications infrastructure ran through wires on United States soil, giving American spies privileged access to the world\u2019s communications. American intelligence agencies have been credibly accused of seeding United States-made electronic exports with bugs and spyware.\nAmerican Apps Dominate in the Five Eyes Countries\nThe critical difference with China lies not in the wiring of chips or lines of code, but in history, culture and scale. By custom, Americans trust that the contents of their snail-mail letters are protected by the Fourth Amendment; government access requires a judge to issue a warrant. American tech firms routinely stand up to the United States government. Apple, for example, has developed default iOS encryptions that shield user activity from the company itself, to the frustration of the F.B.I. An iPhone user in Iran or Belarus benefits from Silicon Valley\u2019s civil libertarianism.\nChina is different. The People\u2019s Republic has always reserved the right to open its citizens\u2019 mail at any time, for any reason; there is no basis to believe its basic approach will differ because the technology is new. Ironically, the internet, which Western techno-utopians prophesied would liberalize China, may instead allow the party to indulge previously impossible fantasies of mass control. The Uighurs of Xinjiang are the first in human history to fully experience the downside of China\u2019s illiberal innovation. They are unlikely to be the last.\nNick Frisch (@NBBF88) is an Asian studies doctoral candidate at Yale\u2019s graduate school, and a resident fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Information Society Project.\nAsh Ngu is a graphics editor for The New York Times.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Talks Open; Soviet Agrees to Shun Blockade Zone Now\nSpecial to The New York Timesashington, Oct. 26--The White House made public tonight a new intelligence report showing that construction of Soviet missile bases in Cuba was proceeding at a rapid rate with the apparent intention of \"achieving a full operational capability as soon as possible.\"\nHigh officials said that such work could not be allowed to continue indefinitely.\nThere was some encouragement here tonight when it became known that Premier Khrushchev had agreed, in response to an appeal by U Thant, Acting Secretary General of the United Nations, to order Soviet ships bound for Cuba to stay away temporarily from the blockade zone.\nMissile Sites Crucial\nHowever, officials here have always thought that the real clue to Soviet intentions was not whether the Russians would attempt to challenge the blockade but whether they would continue or discontinue construction work on the offensive missile sites.\nTherefore, President Kennedy, in a message to MR. Thant assuring him that American ships would do everything possible to avoid a direct confrontation with Soviet ships outside the blockade zone, reiterated United States \"requirements\" that the offensive-weapons systems be withdrawn.\n\"I must point out to you,\" he wrote to Mr. Thant, \"that present work on these systems is still continuing.\"\nThe verified cessations of work on these sites, officials said, was a prime condition for agreements by the United States to enter into talks with the Soviet Union.\nDirect Action Weighed\nOfficials close to rapidly moving developments indicated that, unless work on the sites came to a halt within a few days, the United States must consider what further action should be taken toward achieving its firm objective of the elimination of the missiles.\nThese and other developments strengthened the impression in the capital that the Government was looking beyond the effort to settle the Cuban crisis at the United Nations and toward the possibility of further direct action by the United States.\nThe general expectation here was that the Soviet Union would refuse to meet the American condition that the construction must be brought to a verified halt before talks on the substance of the dispute could begin. These were the elements in the evolving situation that underlined the Government's apparent resolution:\nIn a meeting this morning of the executive committee of the National Security Council, according to informed sources, Adlai E. Stevenson, to make clear to Mr. Thant that the United States was immovable in its determination to get the missile bases out of Cuba. The White House said this afternoon that \"the Soviets are rapidly continuing their construction of missile and launch facilities\" and gave no evidence of \"any intention to dismantle or discontinue work on these missile sites.\" The State Department this morning drew attention to a sentence in President Kennedy's speech of Monday night that read: \"Should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat of the hemisphere, further action will be justified.\" In the Organization of American States, Latin-American Ambassadors agreed with the United States view that the resolution unanimously approved last Tuesday gave the United States and other members of the O.A.S. the right to dismantle the missile bases by force if necessary. Although Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, denied reports that Congressional leaders had been asked by the President to return to Washington next Monday, sources on Capitol Hill said these leaders understood after the second meeting with the President on Wednesday that they would return Monday for a report and further discussion of the situation.\nThe White House also announced that President and Mrs. Kennedy would postpone their state visit to Brazil next month.\nThe President planned to meet tomorrow with the Civil Defense Committee of the Governors Conference, a group headed by Governor Rockefeller.\nActivity Found Continuing\nIn its statement, the White House said that, as of yesterday, \"definite build-ups in these offensive missile sites continued to be made.\"\n\"The activity of these sites,\" the statement continued, \"apparently is directed at achieving a full operational capability as soon as possible.\"\nAt the sites being constructed for intermediate-range ballistic missiles, with a reported reach of more than 2,000 miles, the White House said, bulldozers and cranes were observed yesterday \"actively clearing new areas within the sites and improving the approach roads to the launch pads.\"\n\"For example,\" the White House reported, \"missiles were observed parked in the open on Oct. 23. Surveillance on Oct. 25 revealed that some of these same missiles have now been moved from their original parked positions. Cabling can be seen running from the missile-ready tents to power generators nearby.\"\nConditions on U.N. Talks\nOfficials did not expect the climax to be reached in gunfire at sea but in the political arena at the United Nations over the conditions the United States will set on the beginning to talks. Officials said these conditions are three:\nFirst, work on the missile sites shall stop and not be resumed.\nSecond, the missiles and the sites shall be made and remain totally inoperable.\nThird, no more offensive missiles shall be sent to Cuba.\nThe United States, officials said, will insist that each of these steps must be verified by observers sent by the United Nations.\nThere was little expectation here tonight that the Soviet Union would agree to these conditions, reinforced by inspection. Consequently the White House may have to decide over the weekend what further actions to take. Officials said there were several possible actions short of invasion.\nThe most likely, it is believed, would be extension of the blockade to include all goods. Some officials here are dissatisfied with the limitation of contraband to offensive weapons.\nThey argue that this does not touch the problem since oil, food, machinery and spare parts can be brought in to keep the economy limping along while the missiles are already there in sufficient number to pose a real threat.\nAnother alternative under consideration is pinpoint bombing of the missile sites.\nA third, which would be an accompaniment of either of the first two, would be encouragement of guerrilla warfare.\nOfficials are quite aware that the Soviet Union might respond to either a total blockade or pinpoint bombing by retaliatory action against the access routes to Berlin.\nThis is a matter of great concern, because any action against Cuba that presented the West with the alternative of retreating in Berlin or fighting for it would probably arouse concerns among our European allies. Some officials fear that in such a situation the support that the President had so far had from the NATO countries might weaken.\nHowever, officials here say that this was a risk accepted when the Cuban policy was framed. Furthermore, they say that the allies must also recognize that failure to carry through in Cuba would also gravely impair the West's position in Berlin by casting doubt on the credibility of the United States pledge to fight for Berlin.\nPentagon Stresses Threat\nIf the Soviet Union should agree to the United States conditions, the Administration would be willing to halt the blockade and begin talks aiming at the dismantling of the sites.\nBut officials said that before the United States ships were withdrawn some way must be established to insure that Soviet vessels do not continue to enter Cuban harbors. They point out that it would be easy for United Nations observers to verify that work on missile sites had stopped.\nThe Pentagon, apparently for emphasis, distributed copies of the White House statement that the construction of ballistic missile bases in Cuba was proceeding at an accelerated pace.\nAlso for emphasis apparently, the Pentagon announced an unusual flurry of launchings of the United States' own long-range ballistic missiles for training or scientific purposes. The Pentagon pointed out the following:\nTwo Thors, the 1,500-mile intermediate-range ballistic missile, were used in scientific booster missions, one in the launching of a nuclear device over Johnston Island in the Pacific last midnight, and the other in the launching of an unidentified satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nAlso at Vandenberg, an Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile, with a credited range of 6,000 miles, was launched in a \"routine training\" test. Titan II, ICBM was launched 5,0000 miles in a development test at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, the Pentagon said.\nReturn to the Books Home Page\n|\n|\nHome |\nHelp/Feedback |\nClassifieds |\nServices |", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/10/19/home/crisis-27.html", "tags": [{"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.62723"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.46061"}, {"label": "missiles and missile defense systems", "score": "0.42724"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.24415"}, {"label": "missiles", "score": "0.19702"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.17823"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.15314"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.06376"}, {"label": "ships and shipping", "score": "0.03739"}, {"label": "russia-international relations-us", "score": "0.03577"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.02963"}, {"label": "palestinians", "score": "0.02672"}, {"label": "foreign aid", "score": "0.02515"}, {"label": "embargoes and economic sanctions", "score": "0.02355"}, {"label": "civil war and guerrilla warfare", "score": "0.02019"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01929"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01597"}, {"label": "international trade and world market", "score": "0.01511"}, {"label": "us-international relations-ussr", "score": "0.01455"}, {"label": "navies", "score": "0.01420"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01359"}, {"label": "immigration and refugees", "score": "0.01142"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.01127"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01125"}, {"label": "military bases and installations", "score": "0.00912"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.00868"}, {"label": "arms control and limitation and disarmament", "score": "0.00813"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00775"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00732"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.00707"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["U.S.", "Cuba", "Shun Blockade Zone", "New York", "Timesashington", "Cuba", "Cuba", "United States", "the United States", "the Soviet Union", "the United States", "the United States", "the Soviet Union", "the United States", "Cuba", "the United States", "the United States", "Washington", "Brazil", "the United States", "Cuba", "The United States", "the Soviet Union", "the Soviet Union", "Berlin", "Cuba", "Berlin", "Cuba", "Berlin", "United States", "Berlin", "the Soviet Union", "the United States", "United States", "Cuba", "the United States'", "Vandenberg", "Florida"], "ORG": ["White House", "U Thant", "the United Nations", "Direct Action Weighed", "the United Nations", "Government", "the National Security Council", "The White House", "The State Department", "the Organization of American States", "O.A.S.", "White House", "Capitol Hill", "The White House", "the Civil Defense Committee", "the White House", "the White House", "the White House", "the United Nations", "the White House", "NATO", "Pentagon", "Administration", "United Nations", "Pentagon", "White House", "Pentagon", "Pentagon", "Pentagon", "Home |\nHelp/Feedback |\nClassifieds |\nServices |"], "PERSON": ["Khrushchev", "Kennedy", "Adlai E.

The novelist, Salman Rushdie, author of ''The Satanic Verses,'' said he was taking the threat seriously.\nThe Teheran radio quoted Ayatollah Khomeini as asking ''all the Muslims to execute them,'' referring to Mr. Rushdie, who lives in London, and the publishers of the book, Viking Penguin, ''wherever they find them.''\nHe said that anyone killed carrying out his order would be considered a martyr.\nMr. Rushdie's American agent said there were no plans to call off the author's American promotional tour. All was quiet at Viking Penguin's offices in New York, but a guard there said security was tight.\nThreat Taken 'Very Seriously'\nWednesday was declared a day of mourning in Iran to protest the novel. It has prompted violent protests by Islamic fundamentalists over the author's projection of Islamic myths and Koranic motifs in contemporary and futuristic settings, which many\ncontend is blasphemous.\n''The author of the 'Satanic Verses' book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death,'' said Ayatollah Khomeini, whose\nword is considered law by millions of Shiite Muslims. ''If someone knows them but is unable to kill them, he should hand them over to the people for punishment.''\nMr. Rushdie, who is 41 years old and was born into a Kashmiri Muslim family in Bombay, could not be reached by The New York Times for comment today. But he was quoted as telling the British Broadcasting Corporation that he had to take the threat ''very\nseriously indeed'' and that he ''may well have to think about'' applying to the authorities for protection.\n''I am very sad it should have happened,'' Mr. Rushdie was quoted by the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, as saying. ''It is not true this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much Khomeini\nor anyone else in Iran has read the book or anything more than selected extracts taken out of context.''\nBritain's Foreign Office said today that clarification was being sought over Ayatollah Khomeini's remarks, which, ''if true, are a cause for concern.'' [ A leader of the British Muslims, quoted by Reuters, added grave concern\nto the security situation late tonight by reinforcing Ayatollah Khomeini's call for Mr. Rushdie's execution. Said Abdul Quddas, joint secretary of the Council of Mosques in the northern English city of Bradford,\ntold reporters, ''Every good Muslim is after his life. He has tortured Islam and has to pay the penalty. He deserves hanging. [ ''There are any number of people who would willingly carry out what to\nus would not be a crime but a justified act.'' ] A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to comment on the threat. However, British newspapers said the Special Branch of Scotland Yard was protecting Mr. Rushdie,\nadding that a team of armed officers was probably assigned to accompany the author. Special Branch officers will also increase surveillance on Muslim fundamentalist groups in London and throughout Britain, the agency said.\nThe Khomeini statement came amid a wave of protests and attempts to ban the book. On Sunday, a mob of thousands of enraged Muslims tried to enter and destroy the American cultural center in Islamabad, Pakistan, because Mr. Rushdie's book is being\npublished in the United States. The attack left five people dead and more than 100 people wounded; three people died in similar disturbances in India on Monday.\nMuslims in Britain burned copies of the book last month and W. H. Smith booksellers withdrew it from public display in Bradford, a city in the north that has a large Moslem community.\nThe Press Association quoted Mr. Rushdie's literary agent in Britain, Gillon Aitken, as saying that the author had been ''out and about,'' in response to a question about whether he was in hiding today.\n''I assume he has been getting on with his life,'' Mr. Aitken said.\n''The Satanic Verses'' begins with a plane crash over the English Channel in which two men survive to be ''born again,'' one with a halo, the other with slowly developing horns and hoofs. It is not clear, despite\ntheir appearance, which of them is good and which is evil. They become involved with characters named Alleluia Cone and Mahound, the latter a businessman turned prophet who lives in the imaginary city of Jahilla.\n'A Dirty Conspiracy'\nMr. Rushdie's character the Prophet Mahound resembles the portrayal of Jesus Christ in Martin Scorsese's film ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' in that Mahound is depicted as having a human nature and wrestling with temptation.\nThe work is clearly perceived as offensive to Islam, but what exactly is regarded as insulting has not been spelled out.\nThe Iranian Government condemned the book as ''a dirty conspiracy'' against Islam and urged followers of Ayatollah Khomeini around the world to take action against it. A Government statement read on the Teheran radio called for cells\nof the Party of God -devotees of the Ayatollah and a group of them in Lebanon is believed to be holding Westerners who are missing and believed kidnapped there - to take ''necessary steps to neutralize this plot.''\n''We call on all Party of God cells in the world of Islam to grasp the depth of this black conspiracy,'' the statement said. ''We advise all Islamic Governments not to place themselves against the million masses of angry\nMuslims but to demonstrate their disgust and anger, together with their nation, towards this provocative American deed.''\nThe Iranian press agency quoted Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi as calling Mr. Rushdie an ''American mercenary.''\nMr. Rushdie was quoted as telling Independent Television News here that he doubted that those conducting a campaign against the book were trying to act as ''thought police.''\nReturn to the Books Home Page", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/04/18/specials/rushdie-khomeini.html", "tags": [{"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.93711"}, {"label": "islam", "score": "0.86777"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.78638"}, {"label": "book trade", "score": "0.24655"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.09604"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.08341"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.07789"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.06820"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.06216"}, {"label": "threats and threatening messages", "score": "0.05216"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.04171"}, {"label": "censorship", "score": "0.04073"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.03329"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.03319"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.03318"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.03223"}, {"label": "christians and christianity", "score": "0.02848"}, {"label": "office buildings and commercial properties", "score": "0.02744"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.02591"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.02564"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01906"}, {"label": "fringe groups and movements", "score": "0.01575"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01550"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.01441"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.01434"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01412"}, {"label": "freedom and human rights", "score": "0.01370"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01248"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.01139"}, {"label": "anti-semitism", "score": "0.01135"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Iran", "Teheran", "London", "New York", "Iran", "Bombay", "Britain", "Iran", "Britain", "Bradford", "London", "Britain", "Islamabad", "Pakistan", "the United States", "India", "Britain", "Bradford", "Britain", "Teheran", "Lebanon"], "ORG": ["ONDON", "Islam", "Islam", "The New York Times", "the British Broadcasting Corporation", "the Press Association", "Islam", "Foreign Office", "Reuters", "the Council of Mosques", "Islam", "Scotland Yard", "the Special Branch of Scotland Yard", "Special Branch", "The Press Association", "the English Channel", "Mahound", "Mahound", "Islam", "The Iranian Government", "Islam", "the Party of God", "Party", "Independent Television News"], "PERSON": ["Khomeini", "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini", "Salman Rushdie", "Ayatollah Khomeini", "Rushdie", "Rushdie", "Ayatollah Khomeini", "Rushdie", "Rushdie", "Khomeini", "Ayatollah Khomeini's", "Ayatollah Khomeini's", "Rushdie", "Said Abdul Quddas", "Rushdie", "Khomeini", "Rushdie", "W.

Since the release of Robert Mueller\u2019s report, White House stonewalling of congressional subpoenas and Mr. Mueller\u2019s first public comments, almost 60 House Democrats, a quarter of the caucus, have said they support an impeachment inquiry.\nIf Democrats do move to impeach Mr. Trump, the articles of impeachment drafted against past presidents will probably guide them. The Constitution leaves \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the term that describes impeachable offenses, vague, notes the historian Timothy Naftali, a co-writer of a recent book on impeachment. \u201cSo if you are doing your constitutional duty as an elected member of Congress, how do you define high crimes and misdemeanors?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne of the ways you do it is by looking at past practice.\u201d\nWhat might impeachment articles against Mr. Trump look like? To find out, we reviewed the articles of impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Then we edited them \u2014 by removing and adding passages \u2014 to match the president\u2019s conduct as described in the Mueller report and elsewhere.\nImpeachment is often said to be a political process. But when you assess Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct by the bar for impeachment set by past Democratic and Republican lawmakers for past presidents of both parties, the results are striking. The pathway to a possible Trump impeachment is already mapped out in these historical documents.\nBased on Nixon\u2019s Impeachment\nIn July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, who resigned before the full House could vote on them. Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior maps neatly onto the first and third Nixon articles, which dealt with obstruction of justice. Nixon interfered with a federal investigation of the Watergate break-in by refusing to turn over documents, pressuring witnesses, lying to the public and firing the special prosecutor assigned to the case. In response to Mr. Mueller\u2019s and Congress\u2019s inquiries, Mr. Trump has similarly stonewalled subpoenas, tried to influence witness testimony, lied and attempted to fire Mr. Mueller.\nArticle I\nThe Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence.May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. The special counsel was also given \u201cthe authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel\u2019s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\u201d Subsequent thereto, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entryRussian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\nThe introduction in the first impeachment article against Nixon sets up the main argument Congress would likely use against Mr. Trump: The president attempted to impede a federal investigation into his actions and those of his associates.\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following:\n* making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States;\n* withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, including congressional committees;\nLike Mr. Trump, Nixon never submitted to questioning from F.B.I. investigators. But Nixon misrepresented or lied about his involvement in the Watergate cover-up to Justice Department officials and his own aides.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s investigators deemed Mr. Trump\u2019s written answers about Russia-related topics \u201cinadequate,\u201d but they did not accuse him of providing false information. Like Nixon, however, Mr. Trump did provide false information to potential witnesses, including his own aides. He has also refused to allow congressional committees access to relevant information, including the unredacted Mueller report and witnesses.\n* 3 approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counsellingencouraging witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings;\n* interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Forcethe office of the special counsel and congressional committees;\n* approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities;\n* endeavoring to misuse the Central Intelligence AgencyDepartment of Justice, an agency of the United States;\n* disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability;\n* making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the PresidentTrump 2016 campaign, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct; or\n* endeavoring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony or endeavoring to intimidate individuals who offered testimony.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.\nMost of the above charges against Nixon required only modest tweaks to match Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice, not the Central Intelligence Agency, to go after his political rivals. Mr. Trump\u2019s misconduct focused on covering up actions by members of his presidential campaign rather than the Committee for the Re-election of the President, a fundraising committee separate from the rest of the Nixon campaign apparatus.\nAn impeachment article against Mr. Trump could argue the president encouraged witnesses to give false or misleading statements to investigators and to the public, or focus on how Mr. Trump interfered with the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\nArticle II\nUsing the powers of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purpose of these agencies.\nThis conduct has included one or more of the following:\n* He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavored to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.\n* He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret ServiceDepartment of Justice, and other executive personnel in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance.\n* He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the president, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial.\n* He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavored to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National CommitteeRussian interference in the 2016 election, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President.\n* In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nNixon\u2019s abuses of presidential power, the subject of his second article, were manifold. They involved pressuring federal agencies to punish or surveil his perceived political enemies. While much of this second article doesn\u2019t match what we know of Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, Mr. Trump has undermined the purpose of the federal government by attacking the rule of law and calling for investigations of figures like Hillary Clinton and James Comey.\n\u201cThe spirit he\u2019s cultivating is that the federal bureaucracy only exists to serve the needs of Donald J. Trump,\u201d said Mr. Naftali, the historian.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974April 19, 2019, April 22, 2019, and May 21, 2019; the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019, and May 8, 2019; and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on May 10, 2019, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the president. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.\nBased on Clinton\u2019s Impeachment\nThe first article of impeachment passed by the Republican-controlled House against Bill Clinton was based on testimony he gave before a federal grand jury. Because Mr. Trump refused an in-person interview with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators, did not agree to provide written answers to questions about obstruction and never testified before the grand jury, little of this first article is relevant to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct.\nResolved, That William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate:\nArticles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America, against William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.\nArticle I\nIn his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that:\nOn Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a federal grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.The Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Subsequent thereto, Donald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such Russian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\nIn doing this, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\nBut any case for impeaching Mr. Trump would likely rest on obstruction of justice, the focus of Mr. Clinton\u2019s third article. (Republicans also drafted a second and fourth impeachment article against Mr. Clinton, but neither passed the full House.)\nWe\u2019ve re-ordered the obstruction charges arrayed against Mr. Clinton to better match the timeline of Mr. Trump\u2019s potentially obstructive acts. The quotations describing each of Mr. Trump\u2019s acts come from the redacted Mueller report.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted judicial proceedinginvestigation.\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme included one or more of the following acts:\n* On or about Dec. 17, 1997Feb. 14, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himattempted to persuade the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.end the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into the national security adviser.\n* On or about Dec. 28, 1997, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in alimit the scope of a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation, including by firing the F.B.I. director and attempting to get the attorney general to \u201cunrecuse\u201d himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation.\n* On or about Jan. 18 and Jan. 20-21, 1998June 17, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump related a false and misleading account of events relevant to a federal civil rights action brought against him to a potential witness in that proceeding,ordered the White House counsel to have the special counsel removed in order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witnesscourse of a federal investigation.\nThe obstruction case laid out against President Clinton was largely based on his behavior toward witnesses in the investigation into his conduct. As you can see from our rendering of a Trump indictment, Mr. Trump arguably took more extensive steps than Mr. Clinton did to thwart investigators. Beyond interfering with witnesses and encouraging the giving of false testimony, Mr. Trump tried to limit the scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and have the special counsel removed.\n* 4On Jan. 17, 1998In January and February 2018, at his deposition in a federal civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly allowedengaged in repeated efforts to get his attorneythe White House counsel to makecreate a false and misleading statements to a federal judgerecord characterizing an affidavitthe president\u2019s efforts to remove the special counsel, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge\u201cdeflect or prevent further scrutiny of the president\u2019s conduct towards the investigation.\u201d. Such a false and misleading statementsrecord were subsequently acknowledged by his attorneythe White House counsel in a communication to that judgethe office of the special counsel.\n* Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, and continuing through and including Jan. 14, 1998in spring 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance todiscuss pardons with a potential witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation in order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been harmful to him.\n* On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, 1998In summer 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J.

Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\nBelow you can see what articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump alone might look like. These rewritten articles against Mr. Trump don\u2019t include other potentially impeachable offenses that lack a clear precedent in the Nixon and Clinton cases, such as hush-money payments to women or possible violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.\nAn impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is far from guaranteed. And whether impeaching him would politically help or hurt Democrats remains an open question. But there is no question that by the standards for high crimes and misdemeanors applied to past presidents in living memory, Donald J. Trump has committed impeachable offenses.\nTrump\u2019s impeachment\nArticle I\nThe Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. The special counsel was also given \u201cthe authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel\u2019s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\u201d Subsequent thereto, Donald J.

Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town\u2019s main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortiller\u00eda. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.\nBut inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.\nOutbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children\u2019s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents\u2019 own clothing \u2014 people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.\nA Migrant Jail\nThis story was a collaboration between The New York Times and The El Paso Times.\n\u201cIt gets to a point where you start to become a robot,\u201d said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\nThe little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America\u2019s southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw \u2014 some of them as young as 5 months old \u2014 and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.\nOverview\nThe main processing\ncenter held children\nin cinder-block cells.\nN\nA loading area\nwas converted to\nhouse older\nchildren in\nbunk beds.\nTexas\nClint\nPortable toilets\nand showers\nsat in an\nadjacent yard.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTents housed\ndetainees when the\ninflux was at its peak.\nChain-link fencing\ninside a warehouse\nseparated children\nand adults by gender.\nN\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTexas\nClint\nChildren were\nhoused in cells\nin the main\nprocessing\ncenter and in\na converted\nloading area.\nFencing\ninside a\nwarehouse\nseparated\ndetainees\nby gender.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nN\nTexAS\nClint\nFencing\ninside a\nwarehouse\nseparated\ndetainees\nby gender.\nChildren were\nhoused in cells\nin the main\nprocessing\ncenter and in\na converted\nloading area.\nN\nThe main processing\ncenter held children\nin cinder-block cells.\nTexas\nClint\nA loading area was\nconverted to house older\nchildren in bunk beds.\nPortable toilets and\nshowers sat in an\nadjacent yard.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTents housed\ndetainees when the\ninflux was at its peak.\nChain-link fencing inside a\nwarehouse separated children\nand adults by gender.\nBy The New York Times | Aerial image by Mario Tama/Getty Images\nBorder Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency\u2019s El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.\nBut a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso\u2019s eastern edge, shows that the agency\u2019s leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.\nThe accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.\nThe conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.\nBy all accounts, the Border Patrol\u2019s attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed,\u201d said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.\nMary E. Gonz\u00e1lez, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us\u2019 \u2014 agents told me that,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen.\u201d\nA Forward Operating Base\nArchitects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base \u2014 replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables \u2014 from which agents could go on forays along the border.\nThe station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.\nOfficials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station \u2014 including lawyers, former detainees and staff members \u2014 The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station\u2019s central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.\nProcessing Center\nProcessing Center\nChildren and toddlers were held for days in cinder-block cells with a single toilet.

Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.\nBut the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.\nBeyond the pantry, a door leads to the site\u2019s processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.\nOne of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or \u201cflu cell\u201d for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.\nA part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.\nLoading Area and Yard\nLOADING AREA\nAnd Yard\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nClint border\npatrol station\nLoading area\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nTrailer with showers\nBasketball hoop\nYard\nSleeping mats\nPortable\ntoilets\n10 feet\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nLoading area\nTrailer with showers\nBasketball hoop\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nYard\nSleeping mats\n10 feet\nPortable\ntoilets\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nTrailer with showers\nSleeping mats\n10 feet\nPortable\ntoilets\nBasketball hoop\nClint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.s, or unaccompanied alien children \u2014 children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.\nThree agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children\u2019s rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years \u2014 and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation \u2014 confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.\n\u201cWe have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can\u2019t do that,\u201d the agent said. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that.\u201d\nWarehouse\nTrailer with\nshowers\nWarehouse\nA tin-roof building that is used to store patrol vehicles was converted to hold families.

The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.\nUnaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.\nFamilies, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males \u201capprehended that morning\u201d were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.\nBefore the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house A.T.V.s. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.\nA Chief Agent Under Fire\nAt least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector\u2019s brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.\nThe situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Mr. Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Mr. Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Mr. Hull moved forward with the new procedures.\nBut tension has persisted between Mr. Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Mr. Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.\nMr. Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.\nOfficials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.\nLast month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation \u2014 which is being conducted by the agency\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and the department\u2019s inspector general \u2014 has examined allegations of misconduct.\nAs part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.\nThe uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.\nThat is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.\nLawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.\nBut Mr. Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Mr. Hull told commissioners in Do\u00f1a Ana County in Las Cruces, N.M., in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody,\u201d Mr. Hull said, as quoted in The Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cNow, our stations are looking more like Walmarts \u2014 with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren\u2019t resourced or staffed for and don\u2019t have the space to hold.\u201d\nAn Inspector Arrives\nOne day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection\u2019s chief accountability officer.\nThe Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Mr. Moak\u2019s visit, bulging with 291 children. Mr. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.\nOne girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Mr. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.\nTwo sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Mr. Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility\u2019s hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. \u201cThe sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station,\u201d Mr. Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls\u2019 time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.\nMr. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.\nOne of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad \u2014 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.\nShe looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. \u201cMy God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here,\u201d she recalled.\nOne teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.\n\u201cDid they throw away anything else?\u201d Ms. Binford said she had asked her.\n\u201cEverything,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey threw away my baby\u2019s diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything.\u201d\nOnce at Clint, she told Ms. Binford, the baby\u2019s fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. \u201cWho told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?\u201d one of the agents told her, according to the young woman\u2019s account to Ms. Binford.\nBorder Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants\u2019 needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.\nChildren sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. \u201cIt\u2019s never because they\u2019re mistreated; it\u2019s because they\u2019re homesick,\u201d she said.\nA Father Finds His Sons\nNot long after Mr. Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.\nThe boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys\u2019 epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.\nBut the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint.\nThe first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d they told him.\nRuben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the American government.\nOnly later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the \u201cflu cell.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one to take care of you there,\u201d one told his father.\nIt took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if \u201ctrying to act like little adults\u201d \u2014 until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Ms. Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.\nMuch of the overcrowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico\u2019s crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.\nA Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. \u201cAgents play board games and sports with them,\u201d he said.\nBut the Border Patrol long \u201ctook great pride\u201d in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, \u201cis not a place for kids.\u201d\nIn the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened, but they\u2019ve diverted from their original mission,\u201d said Juli\u00e1n Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, \u201cchildren should not be held here.\u201d\nDora H. Aguirre, Clint\u2019s mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to do their job as a federal agency,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are trying to do the best they can.\u201d\nSimon Romero, Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Manny Fernandez and Caitlin Dickerson reported for The New York Times, and Daniel Borunda and Aaron Montes reported for The El Paso Times.

CF LT ******** IS THE PLATOON LEADER. THE RECON WAS ALONG A KNOWN ROUTE WHICH LT \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 HAD TRAVELED FREQUENTLY AND ESTABLISHED CHECKPOINTS ALONG THIS ROUTE. PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL. HE AND THE IA SQUAD WERE 200M AHEAD OF PATROL MAIN BODY. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 IDENTIFIED THIS POINT AS A FREQUENT CROSSING POINT. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 IDENTIFIED 2 IRANIANS RUN FROM THE VICINITY OF THIS LOCATION BACK TO IRANIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER.\nTHE PATROL SCANNED THE AREA WITH THEIR LRAS. WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS, THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA) NEEDED TO GO. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK HE SENT HIS INTERPRETER, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (A TITAN LOCAL NATIONAL HIRED FROM FOB CALDWELL) TO GO FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT THEY ALL NEEDED TO DEPART. THE INTERPRETER DID SO, BUT RETURNED TO CF LT ********* TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK AND THE IRANIANS WANTED TO HAVE A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT THE BORDER. CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS. THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION. THEY DID NOT MENTION THE INTERPRETER, NOR A FIFTH IA SOLDIER. WE HAVE SUBMITTED AN RTQ TO THE CORPS PAO, AND RECOMMEND RELEASING TO TRY GETTING OUT AHEAD OF ANY IRANIAN CLAIMS OF CROSSING THE BORDER (EXASPERATED BY US KILLING ONE OF THEIR SOLDIERS).\nAS OF 081800D: MNC-I STILL CONSIDERS THE 7 PERSONNEL DUSTWUN UNTIL WE HAVE PROOF OF THEIR STATUS.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ. 1 X LN, 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP-North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP. IA (at the mirror CP) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP, the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS, THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS. THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ. 1 X LN, 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP-North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP. IA (at the mirror CP) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP, the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nSummaryThis document described a plot by Azhar al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi Shiite militia commander, to kidnap American soldiers in Baghdad. The report asserts that he was chosen for this mission because of his training in Iran. The next month, an abortive effort to kidnap American troops in Karbala resulted in the deaths of the four soldiers who were seized. An American spokesman said that Mr. Dulaimi\u2019s fingerprints were found on the getaway car.\nSummaryThis report asserts that Iranian agents were encouraging attacks against Iraqi officials during the American military buildup in Baghdad in 2007.\nSummaryThis documents recounts the seizure of some explosively formed penetrators, the most deadly type of roadside bomb, that were being smuggled from Iran into Iraq, which was a chronic problem.\nSummaryThe field reports assert that Iran trained Iraqi militants in the use of explosive and as snipers.\nSummaryDiaries recovered from hidden weapons caches offer details about the training received by Iraqi militants in Iran.\nSummaryMortar and rocket attacks against the Green Zone continued during the first year of the Obama administration. These are ascribed to the Baghdad branch of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi Shiite militant organization backed by Iran.\nSummaryThe report indicates that American and Iraqi raids against people suspected of being Iranian agents continued during the Obama administration. This raid was carried out by an Iraqi SWAT police unit in Basra with the help of American Special Operations forces.\nSummaryThis document describes a firefight between American and Iranian forces near Iraq's border with Iran. An American platoon accompanied Iraqi soldiers on a search for infiltration routes. The Americans soldiers were instructed to stay at least one kilometer away from the border. The report asserts that an Iranian with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher threatened the American troops, prompting an American soldier to shoot him with a .50-caliber machine gun.\nSummaryThis report describes an episode during which an Apache helicopter is supporting troops on the ground who are taking fire from insurgents. The helicopter fires at them, and as many as 12 militants and 14 civilians are said to have been killed, though it was not clear from the report whether the bodies were counted twice.\nSummaryThis report states that two men believed to have been firing mortars tried to surrender to an Apache helicopter crew. A military lawyer says they are not allowed to surrender to an aircraft. The helicopter fires a missile at the two men, killing them.\nSummaryConfused encounters at checkpoints were often lethal for Iraqis. This report recounts a case in which an Iraqi family driving near a checkpoint kept moving even after Marines fired a flare, prompting the Marines to shoot. The mother was killed, and the father and three daughters were wounded.\nSummaryIf the war was dangerous for Americans, it was far worse for the Iraqis who worked for them. One Iraqi interpreter was killed by an American sniper from his own unit, who mistook him for a militant when the Iraqi became separated from his platoon.\nSummaryThe documents in the archive provide extensive accounts of Iraqi security forces abusing Iraqi prisoners. In this account, an American sergeant documented a case of prisoner abuse in a statement and reported it. It was not clear whether it was followed up. The report follows the standard script in stating that no investigation was started.\nSummaryAt times, American forces were able to intervene to stop the abuse of prisoners. In this case, from May 2005, a detainee reports that \u201cwhen the Marines finally took him, he was treated very well and he was thankful and happy to see them.\u201d\nSummaryThe archive disclosed by WikiLeaks documents hundreds of cases in which Iraqi police officers or soldiers were involved in prisoner abuse. In this case, American soldiers found 173 Iraqis detained by the police, many bearing bruises, sores and burns from cigarettes.\nSummaryThough the documents show clear evidence of prisoner abuse by Iraqis, they also show that such cases were often uninvestigated. In this case, the report explains that because no coalition forces are involved, \u201cno further investigation is necessary.\u201d\nSummaryIran has said that the three American hikers it detained in July 2009 crossed into Iran from Iraq. This report conveys the initial assessment that they were detained by Iranian forces on the Iraqi side of the border.\nSummaryContractors in Iraq were faced with threats from many quarters. In this case, an employee of Armor Group is reported to have shot and killed two co-workers as a result of an altercation. After a wild attempt to escape, a coalition soldier tackled him.\nSummaryThe archive shows many incidents in which contractors drew friendly fire from American troops or the Iraqi Army. In this case, the driver of an unmarked BMW, later identified as a contractor, was shot in a friendly fire incident.\nSummaryThe reports in the archive clearly document the ways in which contractors\u2019 actions contributed to scenes of chaos and violence. This report describes how a driver from Triple Canopy tried to bump a civilian\u2019s car out of its lane, creating a chain of events that resulted in the contractors\u2019 throwing a grenade at one of their own vehicles, possibly to prevent it from being used by insurgents.\nSummaryMany documents show that contractors shot with little discrimination at unarmed civilians. In May 2006, witnesses said that an Iraqi ambulance driver was killed by \u201cuncontrolled small arms firing\u201d after a vehicle owned by the Blackwater security company was hit by an improvised explosive device.\nSummaryImproper actions by contractors were seldom disciplined by American officials. In this case, killings of two civilians by Blackwater employees prompted immediate demonstrations by local Iraqis.\nSummaryAs early as 2005, sectarian killings began to increase, reaching a fever pitch in December 2006. This report raises the suspicion that an Iraqi may have been killed for working for the Americans, a major reason for killings in 2005.\nSummaryThe documents show that by the end of 2006, Iraq had descended into near chaos. This report, dated Dec. 20, 2006, provides details about 28 corpses found throughout Baghdad on a single day, each shot in the head. The report was one of many filed on a day during which at least 168 bodies were found throughout Iraq.\nSummaryAnother instance of prisoner abuse by the Iraqi police. In this case, American troops found evidence of \u201cunchecked torture,\u201d including a wooden pallet and a rubber hose, implements that were often used to beat detainees on their backs and the soles of their feet. Unlike in other cases, in this case Americans officers took action, including ordering a soldier to spend the night in the prison to prevent further abuses.\nSummaryThe prisons were also a site of sectarian violence. In this case, a group of Iraqis used false documents to take 12 detainees from an Iraqi prison on the same day that one of Iraq\u2019s most revered Shiite shrines, the Golden Mosque in Samarra, was bombed. The bombing set off sectarian fury across the country. The prisoners in this report, all Sunnis, were later found dead or critically wounded.\nSummaryA number of reports indicate that militants set up false checkpoints as a way of carrying out sectarian attacks. This report states that seven Iraqi civilians, including a 12-year-old boy, were found dead near one such checkpoint.\nSummaryIn this case, 12 civilians were found dead with their eyes cut out. The 12 had apparently been detained earlier by an Iraqi commando unit.\nSummaryThis report notes that American military and civilian officials played an important behind the scenes role in heading off a confrontation between the Sunni Arab governor of Nineveh Province and Kurdish forces. The episode began when the governor announced plans to attend a sports festival in a heavily Kurdish area. Episodes like these raise the question of what will happen when American forces are withdrawn from Iraq.\nAbout the Redactions\nThe types of information that have been removed from the documents include:\n- Names or precise identifying information of sources.\n- Names of buildings under surveillance.\n- Names of prisoners.\n- Names of kidnap victims.\n- Times required for various tactical military reactions.\n- Radio frequencies or phone numbers used in insurgent communications.\nNames of public figures (generals, prominent police officials, governors, warlords and senior afghan officials) have not been not redacted, though on a case-by-case basis, the names of lower-level employees have been removed.

You Can Trace That to the Plantation.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/slavery-capitalism.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage", "text_content": "American Capitalism Is Brutal. You Can Trace That to the Plantation.\nIn order to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation.\nA couple of years before he was convicted of securities fraud, Martin Shkreli was the chief executive of a pharmaceutical company that acquired the rights to Daraprim, a lifesaving antiparasitic drug. Previously the drug cost $13.50 a pill, but in Shkreli\u2019s hands, the price quickly increased by a factor of 56, to $750 a pill. At a health care conference, Shkreli told the audience that he should have raised the price even higher. \u201cNo one wants to say it, no one\u2019s proud of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut this is a capitalist society, a capitalist system and capitalist rules.\u201d\nThis is a capitalist society. It\u2019s a fatalistic mantra that seems to get repeated to anyone who questions why America can\u2019t be more fair or equal. But around the world, there are many types of capitalist societies, ranging from liberating to exploitative, protective to abusive, democratic to unregulated. When Americans declare that \u201cwe live in a capitalist society\u201d \u2014 as a real estate mogul told The Miami Herald last year when explaining his feelings about small-business owners being evicted from their Little Haiti storefronts \u2014 what they\u2019re often defending is our nation\u2019s peculiarly brutal economy. \u201cLow-road capitalism,\u201d the University of Wisconsin-Madison sociologist Joel Rogers has called it. In a capitalist society that goes low, wages are depressed as businesses compete over the price, not the quality, of goods; so-called unskilled workers are typically incentivized through punishments, not promotions; inequality reigns and poverty spreads. In the United States, the richest 1 percent of Americans own 40 percent of the country\u2019s wealth, while a larger share of working-age people (18-65) live in poverty than in any other nation belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (O.E.C.D.).\nOr consider worker rights in different capitalist nations. In Iceland, 90 percent of wage and salaried workers belong to trade unions authorized to fight for living wages and fair working conditions. Thirty-four percent of Italian workers are unionized, as are 26 percent of Canadian workers. Only 10 percent of American wage and salaried workers carry union cards. The O.E.C.D. scores nations along a number of indicators, such as how countries regulate temporary work arrangements. Scores run from 5 (\u201cvery strict\u201d) to 1 (\u201cvery loose\u201d). Brazil scores 4.1 and Thailand, 3.7, signaling toothy regulations on temp work. Further down the list are Norway (3.4), India (2.5) and Japan (1.3). The United States scored 0.3, tied for second to last place with Malaysia. How easy is it to fire workers? Countries like Indonesia (4.1) and Portugal (3) have strong rules about severance pay and reasons for dismissal. Those rules relax somewhat in places like Denmark (2.1) and Mexico (1.9). They virtually disappear in the United States, ranked dead last out of 71 nations with a score of 0.5.\nThose searching for reasons the American economy is uniquely severe and unbridled have found answers in many places (religion, politics, culture). But recently, historians have pointed persuasively to the gnatty fields of Georgia and Alabama, to the cotton houses and slave auction blocks, as the birthplace of America\u2019s low-road approach to capitalism.\nSlavery was undeniably a font of phenomenal wealth. By the eve of the Civil War, the Mississippi Valley was home to more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the United States. Cotton grown and picked by enslaved workers was the nation\u2019s most valuable export. The combined value of enslaved people exceeded that of all the railroads and factories in the nation. New Orleans boasted a denser concentration of banking capital than New York City. What made the cotton economy boom in the United States, and not in all the other far-flung parts of the world with climates and soil suitable to the crop, was our nation\u2019s unflinching willingness to use violence on nonwhite people and to exert its will on seemingly endless supplies of land and labor. Given the choice between modernity and barbarism, prosperity and poverty, lawfulness and cruelty, democracy and totalitarianism, America chose all of the above.\nNearly two average American lifetimes (79 years) have passed since the end of slavery, only two. It is not surprising that we can still feel the looming presence of this institution, which helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus. The surprising bit has to do with the many eerily specific ways slavery can still be felt in our economic life. \u201cAmerican slavery is necessarily imprinted on the DNA of American capitalism,\u201d write the historians Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman. The task now, they argue, is \u201ccataloging the dominant and recessive traits\u201d that have been passed down to us, tracing the unsettling and often unrecognized lines of descent by which America\u2019s national sin is now being visited upon the third and fourth generations.\n[Listen to an episode of the \u201c1619\u201d podcast with Matthew Desmond and Nikole Hannah-Jones about the economy that slavery built.]\nThey picked in long rows, bent bodies shuffling through cotton fields white in bloom. Men, women and children picked, using both hands to hurry the work. Some picked in Negro cloth, their raw product returning to them by way of New England mills. Some picked completely naked. Young children ran water across the humped rows, while overseers peered down from horses. Enslaved workers placed each cotton boll into a sack slung around their necks. Their haul would be weighed after the sunlight stalked away from the fields and, as the freedman Charles Ball recalled, you couldn\u2019t \u201cdistinguish the weeds from the cotton plants.\u201d If the haul came up light, enslaved workers were often whipped. \u201cA short day\u2019s work was always punished,\u201d Ball wrote.\nCotton was to the 19th century what oil was to the 20th: among the world\u2019s most widely traded commodities. Cotton is everywhere, in our clothes, hospitals, soap. Before the industrialization of cotton, people wore expensive clothes made of wool or linen and dressed their beds in furs or straw. Whoever mastered cotton could make a killing. But cotton needed land. A field could only tolerate a few straight years of the crop before its soil became depleted. Planters watched as acres that had initially produced 1,000 pounds of cotton yielded only 400 a few seasons later. The thirst for new farmland grew even more intense after the invention of the cotton gin in the early 1790s. Before the gin, enslaved workers grew more cotton than they could clean. The gin broke the bottleneck, making it possible to clean as much cotton as you could grow.\n[To get updates on The 1619 Project, and for more on race from The New York Times, sign up for our weekly Race/Related newsletter.]\nThe United States solved its land shortage by expropriating millions of acres from Native Americans, often with military force, acquiring Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. It then sold that land on the cheap \u2014 just $1.25 an acre in the early 1830s ($38 in today\u2019s dollars) \u2014 to white settlers. Naturally, the first to cash in were the land speculators. Companies operating in Mississippi flipped land, selling it soon after purchase, commonly for double the price.\nEnslaved workers felled trees by ax, burned the underbrush and leveled the earth for planting. \u201cWhole forests were literally dragged out by the roots,\u201d John Parker, an enslaved worker, remembered. A lush, twisted mass of vegetation was replaced by a single crop. An origin of American money exerting its will on the earth, spoiling the environment for profit, is found in the cotton plantation. Floods became bigger and more common. The lack of biodiversity exhausted the soil and, to quote the historian Walter Johnson, \u201crendered one of the richest agricultural regions of the earth dependent on upriver trade for food.\u201d\nAs slave labor camps spread throughout the South, production surged. By 1831, the country was delivering nearly half the world\u2019s raw cotton crop, with 350 million pounds picked that year. Just four years later, it harvested 500 million pounds. Southern white elites grew rich, as did their counterparts in the North, who erected textile mills to form, in the words of the Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, an \u201cunhallowed alliance between the lords of the lash and the lords of the loom.\u201d The large-scale cultivation of cotton hastened the invention of the factory, an institution that propelled the Industrial Revolution and changed the course of history. In 1810, there were 87,000 cotton spindles in America. Fifty years later, there were five million. Slavery, wrote one of its defenders in De Bow\u2019s Review, a widely read agricultural magazine, was the \u201cnursing mother of the prosperity of the North.\u201d Cotton planters, millers and consumers were fashioning a new economy, one that was global in scope and required the movement of capital, labor and products across long distances. In other words, they were fashioning a capitalist economy. \u201cThe beating heart of this new system,\u201d Beckert writes, \u201cwas slavery.\u201d\nPerhaps you\u2019re reading this at work, maybe at a multinational corporation that runs like a soft-purring engine. You report to someone, and someone reports to you. Everything is tracked, recorded and analyzed, via vertical reporting systems, double-entry record-keeping and precise quantification. Data seems to hold sway over every operation. It feels like a cutting-edge approach to management, but many of these techniques that we now take for granted were developed by and for large plantations.\nWhen an accountant depreciates an asset to save on taxes or when a midlevel manager spends an afternoon filling in rows and columns on an Excel spreadsheet, they are repeating business procedures whose roots twist back to slave-labor camps. And yet, despite this, \u201cslavery plays almost no role in histories of management,\u201d notes the historian Caitlin Rosenthal in her book \u201cAccounting for Slavery.\u201d Since the 1977 publication of Alfred Chandler\u2019s classic study, \u201cThe Visible Hand,\u201d historians have tended to connect the development of modern business practices to the 19th-century railroad industry, viewing plantation slavery as precapitalistic, even primitive. It\u2019s a more comforting origin story, one that protects the idea that America\u2019s economic ascendancy developed not because of, but in spite of, millions of black people toiling on plantations. But management techniques used by 19th-century corporations were implemented during the previous century by plantation owners.\nPlanters aggressively expanded their operations to capitalize on economies of scale inherent to cotton growing, buying more enslaved workers, investing in large gins and presses and experimenting with different seed varieties. To do so, they developed complicated workplace hierarchies that combined a central office, made up of owners and lawyers in charge of capital allocation and long-term strategy, with several divisional units, responsible for different operations. Rosenthal writes of one plantation where the owner supervised a top lawyer, who supervised another lawyer, who supervised an overseer, who supervised three bookkeepers, who supervised 16 enslaved head drivers and specialists (like bricklayers), who supervised hundreds of enslaved workers. Everyone was accountable to someone else, and plantations pumped out not just cotton bales but volumes of data about how each bale was produced. This organizational form was very advanced for its time, displaying a level of hierarchal complexity equaled only by large government structures, like that of the British Royal Navy.\nLike today\u2019s titans of industry, planters understood that their profits climbed when they extracted maximum effort out of each worker. So they paid close attention to inputs and outputs by developing precise systems of record-keeping. Meticulous bookkeepers and overseers were just as important to the productivity of a slave-labor camp as field hands. Plantation entrepreneurs developed spreadsheets, like Thomas Affleck\u2019s \u201cPlantation Record and Account Book,\u201d which ran into eight editions circulated until the Civil War. Affleck\u2019s book was a one-stop-shop accounting manual, complete with rows and columns that tracked per-worker productivity. This book \u201cwas really at the cutting edge of the informational technologies available to businesses during this period,\u201d Rosenthal told me. \u201cI have never found anything remotely as complex as Affleck\u2019s book for free labor.\u201d Enslavers used the book to determine end-of-the-year balances, tallying expenses and revenues and noting the causes of their biggest gains and losses. They quantified capital costs on their land, tools and enslaved workforces, applying Affleck\u2019s recommended interest rate. Perhaps most remarkable, they also developed ways to calculate depreciation, a breakthrough in modern management procedures, by assessing the market value of enslaved workers over their life spans. Values generally peaked between the prime ages of 20 and 40 but were individually adjusted up or down based on sex, strength and temperament: people reduced to data points.\nThis level of data analysis also allowed planters to anticipate rebellion. Tools were accounted for on a regular basis to make sure a large number of axes or other potential weapons didn\u2019t suddenly go missing. \u201cNever allow any slave to lock or unlock any door,\u201d advised a Virginia enslaver in 1847. In this way, new bookkeeping techniques developed to maximize returns also helped to ensure that violence flowed in one direction, allowing a minority of whites to control a much larger group of enslaved black people. American planters never forgot what happened in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) in 1791, when enslaved workers took up arms and revolted. In fact, many white enslavers overthrown during the Haitian Revolution relocated to the United States and started over.\nOverseers recorded each enslaved worker\u2019s yield. Accountings took place not only after nightfall, when cotton baskets were weighed, but throughout the workday. In the words of a North Carolina planter, enslaved workers were to be \u201cfollowed up from day break until dark.\u201d Having hands line-pick in rows sometimes longer than five football fields allowed overseers to spot anyone lagging behind. The uniform layout of the land had a logic; a logic designed to dominate. Faster workers were placed at the head of the line, which encouraged those who followed to match the captain\u2019s pace. When enslaved workers grew ill or old, or became pregnant, they were assigned to lighter tasks. One enslaver established a \u201csucklers gang\u201d for nursing mothers, as well as a \u201cmeasles gang,\u201d which at once quarantined those struck by the virus and ensured that they did their part to contribute to the productivity machine. Bodies and tasks were aligned with rigorous exactitude. In trade magazines, owners swapped advice about the minutiae of planting, including slave diets and clothing as well as the kind of tone a master should use. In 1846, one Alabama planter advised his fellow enslavers to always give orders \u201cin a mild tone, and try to leave the impression on the mind of the negro that what you say is the result of reflection.\u201d The devil (and his profits) were in the details.\nThe uncompromising pursuit of measurement and scientific accounting displayed in slave plantations predates industrialism. Northern factories would not begin adopting these techniques until decades after the Emancipation Proclamation. As the large slave-labor camps grew increasingly efficient, enslaved black people became America\u2019s first modern workers, their productivity increasing at an astonishing pace. During the 60 years leading up to the Civil War, the daily amount of cotton picked per enslaved worker increased 2.3 percent a year. That means that in 1862, the average enslaved fieldworker picked not 25 percent or 50 percent as much but 400 percent as much cotton than his or her counterpart did in 1801.\nToday modern technology has facilitated unremitting workplace supervision, particularly in the service sector. Companies have developed software that records workers\u2019 keystrokes and mouse clicks, along with randomly capturing screenshots multiple times a day. Modern-day workers are subjected to a wide variety of surveillance strategies, from drug tests and closed-circuit video monitoring to tracking apps and even devices that sense heat and motion. A 2006 survey found that more than a third of companies with work forces of 1,000 or more had staff members who read through employees\u2019 outbound emails. The technology that accompanies this workplace supervision can make it feel futuristic. But it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s new. The core impulse behind that technology pervaded plantations, which sought innermost control over the bodies of their enslaved work force.\nThe cotton plantation was America\u2019s first big business, and the nation\u2019s first corporate Big Brother was the overseer. And behind every cold calculation, every rational fine-tuning of the system, violence lurked. Plantation owners used a combination of incentives and punishments to squeeze as much as possible out of enslaved workers. Some beaten workers passed out from the pain and woke up vomiting. Some \u201cdanced\u201d or \u201ctrembled\u201d with every hit. An 1829 first-person account from Alabama recorded an overseer\u2019s shoving the faces of women he thought had picked too slow into their cotton baskets and opening up their backs. To the historian Edward Baptist, before the Civil War, Americans \u201clived in an economy whose bottom gear was torture.\u201d\nThere is some comfort, I think, in attributing the sheer brutality of slavery to dumb racism. We imagine pain being inflicted somewhat at random, doled out by the stereotypical white overseer, free but poor. But a good many overseers weren\u2019t allowed to whip at will. Punishments were authorized by the higher-ups. It was not so much the rage of the poor white Southerner but the greed of the rich white planter that drove the lash. The violence was neither arbitrary nor gratuitous. It was rational, capitalistic, all part of the plantation\u2019s design. \u201cEach individual having a stated number of pounds of cotton to pick,\u201d a formerly enslaved worker, Henry Watson, wrote in 1848, \u201cthe deficit of which was made up by as many lashes being applied to the poor slave\u2019s back.\u201d Because overseers closely monitored enslaved workers\u2019 picking abilities, they assigned each worker a unique quota. Falling short of that quota could get you beaten, but overshooting your target could bring misery the next day, because the master might respond by raising your picking rate.\nProfits from heightened productivity were harnessed through the anguish of the enslaved. This was why the fastest cotton pickers were often whipped the most. It was why punishments rose and fell with global market fluctuations. Speaking of cotton in 1854, the fugitive slave John Brown remembered, \u201cWhen the price rises in the English market, the poor slaves immediately feel the effects, for they are harder driven, and the whip is kept more constantly going.\u201d Unrestrained capitalism holds no monopoly on violence, but in making possible the pursuit of near limitless personal fortunes, often at someone else\u2019s expense, it does put a cash value on our moral commitments.\nSlavery did supplement white workers with what W.E.B. Du Bois called a \u201cpublic and psychological wage,\u201d which allowed them to roam freely and feel a sense of entitlement. But this, too, served the interests of money. Slavery pulled down all workers\u2019 wages. Both in the cities and countryside, employers had access to a large and flexible labor pool made up of enslaved and free people. Just as in today\u2019s gig economy, day laborers during slavery\u2019s reign often lived under conditions of scarcity and uncertainty, and jobs meant to be worked for a few months were worked for lifetimes. Labor power had little chance when the bosses could choose between buying people, renting them, contracting indentured servants, taking on apprentices or hiring children and prisoners.\nThis not only created a starkly uneven playing field, dividing workers from themselves; it also made \u201call nonslavery appear as freedom,\u201d as the economic historian Stanley Engerman has written. Witnessing the horrors of slavery drilled into poor white workers that things could be worse. So they generally accepted their lot, and American freedom became broadly defined as the opposite of bondage. It was a freedom that understood what it was against but not what it was for; a malnourished and mean kind of freedom that kept you out of chains but did not provide bread or shelter. It was a freedom far too easily pleased.\nIn recent decades, America has experienced the financialization of its economy. In 1980, Congress repealed regulations that had been in place since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, allowing banks to merge and charge their customers higher interest rates. Since then, increasingly profits have accrued not by trading and producing goods and services but through financial instruments. Between 1980 and 2008, more than $6.6 trillion was transferred to financial firms. After witnessing the successes and excesses of Wall Street, even nonfinancial companies began finding ways to make money from financial products and activities. Ever wonder why every major retail store, hotel chain and airline wants to sell you a credit card? This financial turn has trickled down into our everyday lives: It\u2019s there in our pensions, home mortgages, lines of credit and college-savings portfolios. Americans with some means now act like \u201centerprising subjects,\u201d in the words of the political scientist Robert Aitken.\nAs it\u2019s usually narrated, the story of the ascendancy of American finance tends to begin in 1980, with the gutting of Glass-Steagall, or in 1944 with Bretton Woods, or perhaps in the reckless speculation of the 1920s. But in reality, the story begins during slavery.\nConsider, for example, one of the most popular mainstream financial instruments: the mortgage. Enslaved people were used as collateral for mortgages centuries before the home mortgage became the defining characteristic of middle America. In colonial times, when land was not worth much and banks didn\u2019t exist, most lending was based on human property. In the early 1700s, slaves were the dominant collateral in South Carolina. Many Americans were first exposed to the concept of a mortgage by trafficking in enslaved people, not real estate, and \u201cthe extension of mortgages to slave property helped fuel the development of American (and global) capitalism,\u201d the historian Joshua Rothman told me.\nOr consider a Wall Street financial instrument as modern-sounding as collateralized debt obligations (C.D.O.s), those ticking time bombs backed by inflated home prices in the 2000s. C.D.O.s were the grandchildren of mortgage-backed securities based on the inflated value of enslaved people sold in the 1820s and 1830s. Each product created massive fortunes for the few before blowing up the economy.\nEnslavers were not the first ones to securitize assets and debts in America. The land companies that thrived during the late 1700s relied on this technique, for instance. But enslavers did make use of securities to such an enormous degree for their time, exposing stakeholders throughout the Western world to enough risk to compromise the world economy, that the historian Edward Baptist told me that this can be viewed as \u201ca new moment in international capitalism, where you are seeing the development of a globalized financial market.\u201d The novel thing about the 2008 foreclosure crisis was not the concept of foreclosing on a homeowner but foreclosing on millions of them. Similarly, what was new about securitizing enslaved people in the first half of the 19th century was not the concept of securitization itself but the crazed level of rash speculation on cotton that selling slave debt promoted.\nAs America\u2019s cotton sector expanded, the value of enslaved workers soared. Between 1804 and 1860, the average price of men ages 21 to 38 sold in New Orleans grew to $1,200 from roughly $450. Because they couldn\u2019t expand their cotton empires without more enslaved workers, ambitious planters needed to find a way to raise enough capital to purchase more hands. Enter the banks. The Second Bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, began investing heavily in cotton. In the early 1830s, the slaveholding Southwestern states took almost half the bank\u2019s business. Around the same time, state-chartered banks began multiplying to such a degree that one historian called it an \u201corgy of bank-creation.\u201d\nWhen seeking loans, planters used enslaved people as collateral. Thomas Jefferson mortgaged 150 of his enslaved workers to build Monticello. People could be sold much more easily than land, and in multiple Southern states, more than eight in 10 mortgage-secured loans used enslaved people as full or partial collateral. As the historian Bonnie Martin has written, \u201cslave owners worked their slaves financially, as well as physically from colonial days until emancipation\u201d by mortgaging people to buy more people. Access to credit grew faster than Mississippi kudzu, leading one 1836 observer to remark that in cotton country \u201cmoney, or what passed for money, was the only cheap thing to be had.\u201d\nPlanters took on immense amounts of debt to finance their operations. Why wouldn\u2019t they? The math worked out. A cotton plantation in the first decade of the 19th century could leverage their enslaved workers at 8 percent interest and record a return three times that. So leverage they did, sometimes volunteering the same enslaved workers for multiple mortgages. Banks lent with little restraint. By 1833, Mississippi banks had issued 20 times as much paper money as they had gold in their coffers. In several Southern counties, slave mortgages injected more capital into the economy than sales from the crops harvested by enslaved workers.\nGlobal financial markets got in on the action. When Thomas Jefferson mortgaged his enslaved workers, it was a Dutch firm that put up the money. The Louisiana Purchase, which opened millions of acres to cotton production, was financed by Baring Brothers, the well-heeled British commercial bank. A majority of credit powering the American slave economy came from the London money market. Years after abolishing the African slave trade in 1807, Britain, and much of Europe along with it, was bankrolling slavery in the United States. To raise capital, state-chartered banks pooled debt generated by slave mortgages and repackaged it as bonds promising investors annual interest. During slavery\u2019s boom time, banks did swift business in bonds, finding buyers in Hamburg and Amsterdam, in Boston and Philadelphia.\nSome historians have claimed that the British abolition of the slave trade was a turning point in modernity, marked by the development of a new kind of moral consciousness when people began considering the suffering of others thousands of miles away. But perhaps all that changed was a growing need to scrub the blood of enslaved workers off American dollars, British pounds and French francs, a need that Western financial markets fast found a way to satisfy through the global trade in bank bonds. Here was a means to profit from slavery without getting your hands dirty. In fact, many investors may not have realized that their money was being used to buy and exploit people, just as many of us who are vested in multinational textile companies today are unaware that our money subsidizes a business that continues to rely on forced labor in countries like Uzbekistan and China and child workers in countries like India and Brazil. Call it irony, coincidence or maybe cause \u2014 historians haven\u2019t settled the matter \u2014 but avenues to profit indirectly from slavery grew in popularity as the institution of slavery itself grew more unpopular. \u201cI think they go together,\u201d the historian Calvin Schermerhorn told me. \u201cWe care about fellow members of humanity, but what do we do when we want returns on an investment that depends on their bound labor?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, there is a higher consciousness. But then it comes down to: Where do you get your cotton from?\u201d\nBanks issued tens of millions of dollars in loans on the assumption that rising cotton prices would go on forever. Speculation reached a fever pitch in the 1830s, as businessmen, planters and lawyers convinced themselves that they could amass real treasure by joining in a risky game that everyone seemed to be playing. If planters thought themselves invincible, able to bend the laws of finance to their will, it was most likely because they had been granted authority to bend the laws of nature to their will, to do with the land and the people who worked it as they pleased. Du Bois wrote: \u201cThe mere fact that a man could be, under the law, the actual master of the mind and body of human beings had to have disastrous effects. It tended to inflate the ego of most planters beyond all reason; they became arrogant, strutting, quarrelsome kinglets.\u201d What are the laws of economics to those exercising godlike power over an entire people?\nWe know how these stories end. The American South rashly overproduced cotton thanks to an abundance of cheap land, labor and credit, consumer demand couldn\u2019t keep up with supply, and prices fell. The value of cotton started to drop as early as 1834 before plunging like a bird winged in midflight, setting off the Panic of 1837. Investors and creditors called in their debts, but plantation owners were underwater. Mississippi planters owed the banks in New Orleans $33 million in a year their crops yielded only $10 million in revenue. They couldn\u2019t simply liquidate their assets to raise the money. When the price of cotton tumbled, it pulled down the value of enslaved workers and land along with it. People bought for $2,000 were now selling for $60. Today, we would say the planters\u2019 debt was \u201ctoxic.\u201d\nBecause enslavers couldn\u2019t repay their loans, the banks couldn\u2019t make interest payments on their bonds. Shouts went up around the Western world, as investors began demanding that states raise taxes to keep their promises. After all, the bonds were backed by taxpayers. But after a swell of populist outrage, states decided not to squeeze the money out of every Southern family, coin by coin. But neither did they foreclose on defaulting plantation owners. If they tried, planters absconded to Texas (an independent republic at the time) with their treasure and enslaved work force. Furious bondholders mounted lawsuits and cashiers committed suicide, but the bankrupt states refused to pay their debts. Cotton slavery was too big to fail. The South chose to cut itself out of the global credit market, the hand that had fed cotton expansion, rather than hold planters and their banks accountable for their negligence and avarice.\nEven academic historians, who from their very first graduate course are taught to shun presentism and accept history on its own terms, haven\u2019t been able to resist drawing parallels between the Panic of 1837 and the 2008 financial crisis. All the ingredients are there: mystifying financial instruments that hide risk while connecting bankers, investors and families around the globe; fantastic profits amassed overnight; the normalization of speculation and breathless risk-taking; stacks of paper money printed on the myth that some institution (cotton, housing) is unshakable; considered and intentional exploitation of black people; and impunity for the profiteers when it all falls apart \u2014 the borrowers were bailed out after 1837, the banks after 2008.\nDuring slavery, \u201cAmericans built a culture of speculation unique in its abandon,\u201d writes the historian Joshua Rothman in his 2012 book, \u201cFlush Times and Fever Dreams.\u201d That culture would drive cotton production up to the Civil War, and it has been a defining characteristic of American capitalism ever since. It is the culture of acquiring wealth without work, growing at all costs and abusing the powerless. It is the culture that brought us the Panic of 1837, the stock-market crash of 1929 and the recession of 2008. It is the culture that has produced staggering inequality and undignified working conditions. If today America promotes a particular kind of low-road capitalism \u2014 a union-busting capitalism of poverty wages, gig jobs and normalized insecurity; a winner-take-all capitalism of stunning disparities not only permitting but awarding financial rule-bending; a racist capitalism that ignores the fact that slavery didn\u2019t just deny black freedom but built white fortunes, originating the black-white wealth gap that annually grows wider \u2014 one reason is that American capitalism was founded on the lowest road there is.\nMatthew Desmond is a professor of sociology at Princeton University and a contributing writer for the magazine.

Absolutely,\" said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican who heads the Military Research and Development Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, in a telephone interview on Friday. Weldon held a closed-door briefing last month at which military officials told House members that the Pentagon was facing new threats from hackers.\nRelated Article\nComputer Hackers Are Stopped; Pentagon Networks Were Victim\n(March 5, 1999)\n\"Attack\" is a strong word, one that might bring to mind the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor. But some computer security experts stress that while the hacker activity that the House heard about is a potential threat, calling it an attack could be an overstatement. Much of it appears to be something closer to cold war espionage than a bombing run.\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va., first detected the unusual activity that John J. Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, described to the House last month. Fred Kerby, the information system security manager at the center, characterized it as a \"low and slow scan,\" designed to map out military computer networks without attracting attention.\nDrew Dean, a computer security expert at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, said it could be misleading to characterize this kind of scan as a full attack.\n\"It's a precursor to attack,\" he said. \"If someone I didn't know scanned my machine, I would assume it was an unfriendly act.\" Dean noted, however, that there are often legitimate and innocent reasons for a computer user to check out another machine across the Internet.\nIn fact, the Norwegian Supreme Court was recently asked to rule on whether or not such scanning was illegal. The court decided that it was not, because it was similar to a knock on the door, not forced entry.\nA hacker wanting to learn something about an organization's computer network might begin by scanning the network with the \"ping\" protocol, which sends a small packet of data to a computer and asks it to respond to see if it is connected to the network. This is equivalent to calling a list of sequential telephone numbers and seeing who answers.\nKerby at the Naval Surface Warfare Center said that most military sites routinely block out ping requests. \"We don't allow them through,\" he said. \"We regard them as an ankle biter ... We just note that they came up and rang the door bell, but we had everything secured before they got here.\"\nSome hackers use more sophisticated probes. It is possible, for instance, to see if a computer accepts e-mail by sending a trial message. This information can be exploited, in some cases, because older versions of the popular e-mail program known as Sendmail have numerous security holes that could give a hacker access to a system. Robert Tappan Morris Jr., then an undergraduate at Cornell University, used one such hole to launch a \"worm\" program that crippled the Internet in 1988.\nIn the case of the latest probes, the hackers tried to conceal the scale of their effort by sending requests from a number of different computers.\n\"This is what's known as a coordinated attack,\" said John Green, a senior security analyst at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. \"It's not detected by most commercial detection systems. What made this significant is that it was low and slow. We would get very few packets from each site.\"\nThe Dahlgren center discovered these distributed probes with a new surveillance system they designed called \"Shadow,\" which looks for patterns in data traffic. In this case, it analyzed packet flows over several months and revealed that many machines were being completely probed.\n\"Instead of hitting 65,536 ports on one computer, they'll be probing one or two ports on each computer, then one or two on another computer,\" Kerby said. After some time, all of the ports on each computer would have been systematically probed by several machines acting in concert.\n\"Scanning or probing is just a reconnaissance effort,\" Green said. \"Once they gather a map of your network, they can then go back and target the machines that they've discovered.\"\nAssessing the real danger of this activity is difficult to do. Many people use tools like the ping protocol to test and debug their networks. In fact, those probing the military networks may be using the same tools used routinely by the network administrators, because they have both legitimate and illegitimate uses.\nDetermining the scope of the hackers' effort is also hard, in part because the Department of Defense refuses to say much about them. The investigation is still unfolding and is also classified.\nThe Pentagon has said that, as is the case with a vast majority of hacking attempts, the recent probes did not result in the penetration of any computers storing sensitive information. Also, the Dahlgren center said it found a way to thwart this method of probing, and has told all military services about the remedy. It has posted the Shadow software on its Web site so any organization can use it freely.\nSome security experts and critics of the military budget dismiss the recent talk of \"cyberwar\" as a public relations effort, intended to get Congress to increase military spending. They point out that truly sensitive government computers are not even connected to the Internet. It is important to ask, they say, whether the activity described to Congress was an attempt to launch missiles or just probes of innocent desktop computers used to surf the Web.\n\"It would not surprise me if this was a public relations maneuver,\" said Winn Schwartau, a security consultant and author of the book \"Information Warfare,\" in a telephone interview on Friday.\nSchwartau said, however, that the nation is not spending enough to defend itself from enemies armed with computers and hacking expertise. \"Maybe they're being more open about it to help with the overall awareness that America is sorely lacking,\" he said.\n\"Is surveillance an offensive activity?\" Schwartau asked. \"Under the cold-war mentality, it was. A U2 surveillance of Russia was considered offensive. Some satellite surveillance was considered offensive.\"\nMilitary computers have long been a favorite target of members of the hacker underground wanting to show off their skills. But Representative Weldon said it is important not to dismiss all hacking attempts as the work of computerized joyriders.\n\"I can tell you, I know there are countries out there that are putting money into information warfare,\" he said. \"You know, they can't match our military, so they take what they have: high-performance computers and people who know systems. Then you work on compromising our systems.\"\nWeldon noted that the Defense Department is not the only target of malicious hackers. \"We know of banks who've had their firewalls broken and money transferred out, and they're not going to talk about it,\" he said. The private sector needs to cooperate more with the government in this area, he said.\nRelated Sites\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability.\nPeter Wayner at pwayner@nytimes.com welcomes your comments and suggestions.\n|\n|\nHome | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace\nQuick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel\nHelp/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today\nCopyright 1999 The New York Times Company", "article": "https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/03/cyber/articles/08defense.html", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.76139"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.70883"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.46266"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.45114"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.37297"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.18343"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.14350"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.13362"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.11289"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.10994"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.10540"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.09509"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.05448"}, {"label": "atomic weapons", "score": "0.05385"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.05063"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.04932"}, {"label": "security and warning systems", "score": "0.04748"}, {"label": "world war ii (1939-45)", "score": "0.04649"}, {"label": "united states international relations", "score": "0.04613"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.03505"}, {"label": "espionage", "score": "0.03418"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.03302"}, {"label": "military aircraft", "score": "0.03069"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.03039"}, {"label": "electronic mail", "score": "0.02897"}, {"label": "war and revolution", "score": "0.02883"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.02775"}, {"label": "public opinion", "score": "0.02577"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.02239"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01848"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Pennsylvania", "Dahlgren", "Va.", "America", "Russia"], "ORG": ["PETER", "the Military Research and Development Subcommittee", "the House Armed Services Committee", "House", "Pentagon", "Pentagon Networks", "House", "The Naval Surface Warfare Center", "Defense", "House", "Xerox", "Palo Alto Research Center", "the Norwegian Supreme Court", "Cornell University", "the Naval Surface Warfare Center", "Green", "the Department of Defense", "Pentagon", "Congress", "Congress", "the Defense Department", "The New York Times", "Times", "The New York Times Company"], "PERSON": ["Curt Weldon", "Weldon", "John J.

What Went Wrong?\nOnline predators create and share the illegal material, which is increasingly cloaked by technology. Tech companies, the government and the authorities are no match.\nThe images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.\nPictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.\nMore than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.\nYet the explosion in detected content kept growing \u2014 exponentially.\nAn investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.\nLaw enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.\nThe Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery \u2014 the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities \u2014 was ill equipped for the expanding demands.\nA paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at \u201ca breaking point,\u201d with reports of abusive images \u201cexceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.\u201d It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.\nBy Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\nThe Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.\nIn interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.\nMany of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to deal with it,\u201d said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is \u2014 that\u2019s the thing that keeps this alive.\u201d\nThe Times\u2019s reporting revealed a problem global in scope \u2014 most of the images found last year were traced to other countries \u2014 but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery\u2019s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.\nWhile the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.\nIn a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.\nWith so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.\n\u201cWe go home and think, \u2018Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,\u2019\u201d said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.\nIn some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.\nAfter years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.\nBut police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.\nAnd when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nAll the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.\nThe law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today\u2019s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.\nThe Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department\u2019s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one \u201cfelt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.\u201d\nThe federal government has also not lived up to the law\u2019s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.\nCongress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement \u2014 depleting 40 percent of the units\u2019 discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.\nAlicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.\n\u201cI remember looking around the room, and there wasn\u2019t a dry eye,\u201d said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. \u201cThe federal bill passed, but it wasn\u2019t funded. So it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nFurther impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.\nThe nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s a resource and volume issue,\u201d said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. \u201cFirst priority is making sure we\u2019re assessing the risk of the children. We\u2019re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.\u201d\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government\u2019s failures. After being briefed on The Times\u2019s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.\nStacie B. Harris, the Justice Department\u2019s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. \u201cWe are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,\u201d said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.\nThe fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.\nWhen reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security\u2019s investigative section \u2014 which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism \u2014 is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.\n\u201cWe could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,\u201d said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.\nThe Cutting Edge\nThe videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among \u201cthe most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.\u201d\nOne showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while \u201canother child urinates\u201d on her face, according to court documents.\nAnother showed a woman \u201cinserting an ice cube into the vagina\u201d of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.\n\u201cThe predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,\u201d according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.\nThe videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.\nIncreasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.\nThe site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as \u201cproducers.\u201d\nMultiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child\u2019s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.\nThe highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.\n\u201cPeople who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,\u201d said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.\nOffenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.\nThe anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.\n\u201cHistorically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, \u2018I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,\u2019\u201d said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. \u201cBut now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.\u201d\nExhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain \u201csafe\u201d while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.\nThe offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, \u201cwent to great lengths to hide\u201d his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities \u201ctrillions of years\u201d to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.\nThe site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children \u2014 aged 3 months to 8 years \u2014 and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant\u2019s anus.\nMr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that \u201ccapturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,\u201d according to court records.\nSome of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.\n\u2018Truly Terrible Things\u2019\nThe surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.\nThe companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies\u2019 activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.\nHemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.\nThe recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse \u201cwouldn\u2019t exist if they did their job then,\u201d said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.\nHany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.\n\u201cThe companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.\u201d\nFederal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge issue for us,\u201d said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.\u201d\nMost tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.\nPolice officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr\u2019s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as \u201clong-term and ongoing\u201d in an internal document.\nA recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.\nIn a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.\nA spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.\nThe law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.\nBing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.\nA Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.\nData obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook\u2019s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company\u2019s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.\nFacebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for \u201ctruly terrible things like child exploitation.\u201d\n\u201cEncryption is a powerful tool for privacy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.\u201d\n\u2018Vastly Inadequate\u2019\n\u201cIn a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,\u201d said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. \u201cHe then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.\u201d\nMr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said \u201cwe see every day.\u201d\nHe went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. \u201cWe are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,\u201d he said.\nMr. Waters\u2019s testimony was delivered 12 years ago \u2014 in 2007.\nThe following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.\nToday, Mr. Waters\u2019s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.\nAnnual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law\u2019s reauthorization, said there was \u201cno adequate or logical explanation and no excuse\u201d for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be \u201cvastly inadequate.\u201d\nAnother cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.\nWhen the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. \u201cThis is supposed to be the quarterback,\u201d said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision\u2019s authors.\nEven when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.\nIn 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.\nAt the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no \u201ctime frame\u201d for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.\nFounded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.\nBut as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.\nThe center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don\u2019t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,\u201d said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.\nIn a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.\nDespite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.\nMr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.\nThe Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.\nA spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children\u2019s.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,\u201d said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.\nThis close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.\nIf that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.\nAn Ugly Mirror\nIt was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped \u201cWelcome Friends\u201d sign decorated the front yard.\nAt the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.\nThe man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being \u201corally sodomized\u201d by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.\n\u201cThe sad thing is that\u2019s pretty tame compared to what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general\u2019s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.\nThe year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth\u2019s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.\nThe Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.\nNote: Data is for fiscal years.\nBy Rich Harris and Rumsey Taylor | Source: Justice Department\nMuch of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.\n\u201cI thought that I was in the underbelly of society \u2014 until I came here,\u201d said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.\nWhile any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.\n\u201cI think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,\u201d Ms. Lippert said.\nThe internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.\nBut the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.\nSome state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.\nSteven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. \u201cThey turn away from it because it\u2019s too ugly of a mirror,\u201d he said.\nYet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.\n\u201cI think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,\u201d said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. \u201cYou got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.\u201d\nCommon language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people\u2019s minds. While the imagery is often defined as \u201cchild pornography\u201d in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.\n\u201cEach and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,\u201d said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. \u201cThe violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.\u201d\nProduced by Rich Harris, Virginia Lozano, Adriana Rami\u0107 and Rumsey Taylor.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/28/us/child-sex-abuse.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage&mtrref=www.axios.com&gwh=5A75A448EA31F448D0E6EEFAD5B9A8C8&gwt=pay&assetType=REGIWALL", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.86114"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.59531"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.24935"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.21956"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.17669"}, {"label": "recordings (video)", "score": "0.14772"}, {"label": "bombs and bomb plots", "score": "0.08935"}, {"label": "sex crimes", "score": "0.07869"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.06567"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.04971"}, {"label": "child abuse and neglect", "score": "0.04416"}, {"label": "recordings (audio)", "score": "0.03642"}, {"label": "computer software", "score": "0.03492"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.03008"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.02998"}, {"label": "privacy", "score": "0.02897"}, {"label": "ethics", "score": "0.02525"}, {"label": "bombs and explosives", "score": "0.02226"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.02082"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.01890"}, {"label": "violence", "score": "0.01860"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.01798"}, {"label": "pornography and obscenity", "score": "0.01735"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.01727"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01605"}, {"label": "drug abuse and traffic", "score": "0.01502"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.01468"}, {"label": "states (us)", "score": "0.01436"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.01387"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.01345"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Washington", "the United States", "the United States", "Florida", "Nashville", "Ohio", "Ohio", "Cook County", "Ill.", "Ohio", "Illinois", "the United States", "Seattle", "Missouri", "New Jersey", "Texas", "Wisconsin", "Polk County", "Wis.", "Wisconsin", "Washington", "the United States", "Connecticut", "Florida", "Seattle", "Canada", "Salt Lake City", "Utah", "Utah", "Utah", "Illinois", "Chicago", "New Jersey", "New Jersey", "Kansas"], "ORG": ["The New York Times", "The Justice Department", "Congress", "the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "Rich Harris | Source", "The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "Times", "Times", "Microsoft", "Dropbox", "the Los Angeles Police Department", "Facebook", "Google", "Facebook", "the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "Congress", "Times", "The Justice Department", "Congress", "Congress", "the Department of Homeland Security", "Times", "the Justice Department", "the Federal Bureau of Investigation", "Homeland Security", "Homeland Security", "the National Security Agency", "the Brookings Institution", "Times", "Polaroid", "Microsoft", "Myspace and News Corporation", "Microsoft", "the State of Washington", "Tumblr", "Tumblr", "Tumblr", "Tumblr", "Times", "Verizon", "Tumblr", "Verizon", "Verizon", "Tumblr", "Automattic", "Microsoft", "Snap", "Snap", "Microsoft", "Snap", "Facebook", "WhatsApp", "Facebook", "Facebook", "the State of Wyoming", "Congress", "Congress", "the Justice Department", "The Justice Department", "the Justice Department", "the Government Accountability Office", "the Justice Department", "Congress", "The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children", "Palantir", "Google", "Congress", "The Times", "the Justice Department", "Times", "Google", "the Canadian Center for Child Protection", "Fourth Amendment", "Ugly Mirror", "Justice Department", "Congress", "the Justice Department"], "PERSON": ["O.K.", "Facebook Messenger", "Paula Meares", "Messenger", "Francey Hakes", "Alicia Kozakiewicz", "Kozakiewicz", "John Shehan", "Debbie Wasserman Schultz", "William Barr", "Stacie B.

Now some of those faces may have the ability to sue.\nOne day in 2005, a mother in Evanston, Ill., joined Flickr. She uploaded some pictures of her children, Chloe and Jasper. Then she more or less forgot her account existed.\nYears later, their faces are in a database that\u2019s used to test and train some of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in the world.\nHow Photos of Your Kids Are Powering Surveillance Technology\nMillions of Flickr images were sucked into a database called MegaFace. Now some of those faces may have the ability to sue.\nThe pictures of Chloe and Jasper Papa as kids are typically goofy fare: grinning with their parents; sticking their tongues out; costumed for Halloween. Their mother, Dominique Allman Papa, uploaded them to Flickr after joining the photo-sharing site in 2005.\nNone of them could have foreseen that 14 years later, those images would reside in an unprecedentedly huge facial-recognition database called MegaFace. Containing the likenesses of nearly 700,000 individuals, it has been downloaded by dozens of companies to train a new generation of face-identification algorithms, used to track protesters, surveil terrorists, spot problem gamblers and spy on the public at large.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gross and uncomfortable,\u201d said Mx. Papa, who is now 19 and attending college in Oregon. \u201cI wish they would have asked me first if I wanted to be part of it. I think artificial intelligence is cool and I want it to be smarter, but generally you ask people to participate in research. I learned that in high school biology.\u201d\nBy law, most Americans in the database don\u2019t need to be asked for their permission \u2014 but the Papas should have been.\nAs residents of Illinois, they are protected by one of the strictest state privacy laws on the books: the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a 2008 measure that imposes financial penalties for using an Illinoisan\u2019s fingerprints or face scans without consent.\nThose who used the database \u2014 companies including Google, Amazon, Mitsubishi Electric, Tencent and SenseTime \u2014 appear to have been unaware of the law, and as a result may have huge financial liability, according to several lawyers and law professors familiar with the legislation.\nHow MegaFace was born\nHow did the Papas and hundreds of thousands of other people end up in the database? It\u2019s a roundabout story.\nIn the infancy of facial-recognition technology, researchers developed their algorithms with subjects\u2019 clear consent: In the 1990s, universities had volunteers come to studios to be photographed from many angles. Later, researchers turned to more aggressive and surreptitious methods to gather faces at a grander scale, tapping into surveillance cameras in coffee shops, college campuses and public spaces, and scraping photos posted online.\nAccording to Adam Harvey, an artist who tracks the data sets, there are probably more than 200 in existence, containing tens of millions of photos of approximately one million people. (Some of the sets are derived from others, so the figures include some duplicates.) But these caches had flaws. Surveillance images are often low quality, for example, and gathering pictures from the internet tends to yield too many celebrities.\nIn June 2014, seeking to advance the cause of computer vision, Yahoo unveiled what it called \u201cthe largest public multimedia collection that has ever been released,\u201d featuring 100 million photos and videos. Yahoo got the images \u2014 all of which had Creative Commons or commercial use licenses \u2014 from Flickr, a subsidiary.\nThe database creators said their motivation was to even the playing field in machine learning. Researchers need enormous amounts of data to train their algorithms, and workers at just a few information-rich companies \u2014 like Facebook and Google \u2014 had a big advantage over everyone else.\n\u201cWe wanted to empower the research community by giving them a robust database,\u201d said David Ayman Shamma, who was a director of research at Yahoo until 2016 and helped create the Flickr project. Users weren\u2019t notified that their photos and videos were included, but Mr. Shamma and his team built in what they thought was a safeguard.\nThey didn\u2019t distribute users\u2019 photos directly, but rather links to the photos; that way, if a user deleted the images or made them private, they would no longer be accessible through the database.\nBut this safeguard was flawed. The New York Times found a security vulnerability that allows a Flickr user\u2019s photos to be accessed even after they\u2019ve been made private. (Scott Kinzie, a spokesman for SmugMug, which acquired Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, said the flaw \u201cpotentially impacts a very small number of our members today, and we are actively working to deploy an update as quickly as possible.\u201d Ben MacAskill, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, added that the Yahoo collection was created \u201cyears before our engagement with Flickr.\u201d)\nAdditionally, some researchers who accessed the database simply downloaded versions of the images and then redistributed them, including a team from the University of Washington. In 2015, two of the school\u2019s computer science professors \u2014 Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and Steve Seitz \u2014 and their graduate students used the Flickr data to create MegaFace.\nContaining more than four million photos of some 672,000 people, it held deep promise for testing and perfecting face-recognition algorithms.\nMonitoring Uighurs and outing porn actors\nImportantly to the University of Washington researchers, MegaFace included children like Chloe and Jasper Papa. Face-recognition systems tend to perform poorly on young people, but Flickr offered a chance to improve that with a bonanza of children\u2019s faces, for the simple reason that people love posting photos of their kids online.\nIn 2015 and 2016, the University of Washington ran the \u201cMegaFace Challenge,\u201d inviting groups working on face-recognition technology to use the data set to test how well their algorithms were working.\nThe school asked people downloading the data to agree to use it only for \u201cnoncommercial research and educational purposes.\u201d More than 100 organizations participated, including Google, Tencent, SenseTime and NtechLab. In all, according to a 2016 university news release, \u201cmore than 300 research groups\u201d have worked with the database. It has been publicly cited by researchers from Amazon and, according to Mr. Harvey, Mitsubishi Electric and Philips.\nSome of these companies have been criticized for the way clients have deployed their algorithms: SenseTime\u2019s technology has been used to monitor the Uighur population in China, while NtechLab\u2019s has been used to out pornography actors and identify strangers on the subway in Russia.\nSenseTime\u2019s chief marketing officer, June Jin, said that company researchers used the MegaFace database only for academic purposes. \u201cResearchers have to use the same data set to ensure their results are comparable like-for-like,\u201d Ms. Jin wrote in an email. \u201cAs MegaFace is the most widely recognized database of its kind, it has become the de facto facial-recognition training and test set for the global academic and research community.\u201d\nNtechLab spokesman Nikolay Grunin said the company deleted MegaFace after taking part in the challenge, and added that \u201cthe main build of our algorithm has never been trained on these images.\u201d Google declined to comment.\nA spokeswoman for the University of Washington declined to make MegaFace\u2019s lead researchers available for interviews, saying they \u201chave moved on to other projects and don\u2019t have the time to comment on this.\u201d Efforts to contact them individually were unsuccessful.\nMegaFace\u2019s creation was financed in part by Samsung, Google\u2019s Faculty Research Award, and by the National Science Foundation/Intel.\nIn recent years, Ms. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman has sold a face-swapping image company to Facebook and advanced deep-fake technology by converting audio clips of Barack Obama into a realistic, synthetic video of him giving a speech. She is now working on a \u201cmoonshot project\u201d at Google.\n\u2018What the hell? That is bonkers\u2019\nMegaFace remains publicly available for download. When The New York Times recently requested access, it was granted within a minute.\nMegaFace doesn\u2019t contain people\u2019s names, but its data is not anonymized. A spokesman for the University of Washington said researchers wanted to honor the images\u2019 Creative Commons licenses. As a result, each photo includes a numerical identifier that links back to the original Flickr photographer\u2019s account. In this way, The Times was able to trace many photos in the database to the people who took them.\n\u201cWhat the hell? That is bonkers,\u201d said Nick Alt, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles, when told his pictures were in the database, including photos he took of children at a public event in Playa Vista, Calif., a decade ago.\n\u201cThe reason I went to Flickr originally was that you could set the license to be noncommercial. Absolutely would I not have let my photos be used for machine-learning projects. I feel like such a schmuck for posting that picture. But I did it 13 years ago, before privacy was a thing.\u201d\nAnother subject, who asked to be identified as J., is now a 15-year-old high school sophomore in Las Vegas. Photos of him as a toddler are in the MegaFace database, thanks to his uncle\u2019s posting them to a Flickr album after a family reunion a decade ago. J. was incredulous that it wasn\u2019t illegal to put him in the database without his permission, and he is worried about the repercussions.\nSince middle school, he has been part of an Air Force Association program called CyberPatriot, which tries to steer young people with programming skills toward careers in cybersecurity. \u201cI\u2019m very protective of my digital footprint because of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI try not to post photos of myself online. What if I decide to work for the N.S.A.?\u201d\nFor J., Mr. Alt and most other Americans in the photos, there is little recourse. Privacy law is generally so permissive in the United States that companies are free to use millions of people\u2019s faces without their knowledge to power the spread of face-recognition technology. But there is an exception.\nIn 2008, Illinois passed a prescient law protecting the \u201cbiometric identifiers and biometric information\u201d of its residents. Two other states, Texas and Washington, went on to pass their own biometric privacy laws, but they aren\u2019t as robust as the one in Illinois, which strictly forbids private entities to collect, capture, purchase or otherwise obtain a person\u2019s biometrics \u2014 including a scan of their \u201cface geometry\u201d \u2014 without that person\u2019s consent.\n\u201cPhotos themselves are not covered by the Biometric Information Privacy Act, but the scan of the photos should be. The mere use of biometric data is a violation of the statute,\u201d said Faye Jones, a law professor at the University of Illinois. \u201cUsing that in an algorithmic contest when you haven\u2019t notified people is a violation of the law.\u201d\nIllinois residents like the Papas whose faceprints are used without their permission have the right to sue, said Ms. Jones, and are entitled to $1,000 per use, or $5,000 if the use was \u201creckless.\u201d The Times attempted to measure how many people from Illinois are in the MegaFace database; one approach, using self-reported location information, suggested 6,000 individuals, and another, using geotagging metadata, indicated as many as 13,000.\nTheir biometrics have likely been processed by dozens of companies. According to multiple legal experts in Illinois, the combined liability could add up to more than a billion dollars, and could form the basis of a class action.\n\u201cWe have plenty of ambitious class-action lawyers here in Illinois,\u201d said Jeffrey Widman, the managing partner at Fox Rothschild in Chicago. \u201cThe law\u2019s been on the books in Illinois since 2008 but was basically ignored for a decade. I guarantee you that in 2014 or 2015, this potential liability wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar. But the technology has now caught up with the law.\u201d\nA $35 billion case against Facebook\nIt\u2019s remarkable that the Illinois law even exists. According to Matthew Kugler, a law professor at Northwestern University who has researched the Illinois act, it was inspired by the 2007 bankruptcy of a company called Pay by Touch, which had the fingerprints of many Americans, including Illinoisans, on file; there were worries that it could sell them during its liquidation.\nNo one from the technology industry weighed in on the bill, according to legislative and lobbying records.\n\u201cWhen the law was passed, no one who is now concerned about it was thinking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Kugler said. Silicon Valley is aware of the law now. Bloomberg News reported in April 2018 that lobbyists for Google and Facebook were trying to weaken its provisions.\nMore than 200 class-action lawsuits alleging misuse of residents\u2019 biometrics have been filed in Illinois since 2015, including a $35 billion case against Facebook for using face recognition to tag people in photos. That lawsuit gained momentum in August, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the company\u2019s arguments that the people did not suffer \u201cconcrete harm.\u201d\nIn recent years, technology companies have been treading more lightly in states with biometric legislation. When Google released a feature in 2018 that matched selfies to famous works of art, people in Illinois and Texas couldn\u2019t use it. And Google\u2019s Nest security cameras don\u2019t offer an otherwise standard feature for recognizing familiar faces in Illinois.\n\u201cIt\u2019s creepy that you found me. I always lived with the philosophy that what I put out there was public, but I couldn\u2019t have imagined this,\u201d said Wendy Piersall, a publisher and City Council member in Woodstock, Ill., whose photos, along with those of her three children, were in the MegaFace database.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use the fun art app; why are you using our kids\u2019 faces to test your software?\u201d she added. \u201cMy photos there are geotagged to Illinois. It\u2019s not hard to figure out where these pictures were taken. I\u2019m not a sue-happy person, but I would cheer someone else on to go after this.\u201d\nPrivacy nihilism\nSome of the Illinois lawsuits have been settled or dismissed, but most are active, and Mr. Kugler, the Northwestern law professor, noted that basic legal questions remained unanswered. It\u2019s unclear what the legal liability would be for a company that takes photos uploaded in Illinois but processes the facial data in another state, or even another country.\n\u201cDefendants are going to be creative in searching for arguments, because no one wants to be stuck holding this expensive hot potato,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for Amazon Web Services said its use of the data set was \u201ccompliant with B.I.P.A.,\u201d while declining to explain how. Mario Fante, a spokesman for Philips, wrote in an email that the company \u201cwas never aware of any Illinois residents included in the above-mentioned data set.\u201d\nVictor Balta, a spokesman for the University of Washington, said, \u201cAll uses of photos in the researchers\u2019 database are lawful. The U.W. is a public research university, not a private entity, and the Illinois law targets private entities.\u201d\nSome of the Illinoisans we found in MegaFace and contacted were indifferent about the use of their faces.\n\u201cI do know that when you upload information online, it can be used in unexpected ways, so I guess I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Chris Scheufele, a web developer in Springfield. \u201cWhen you upload information to the internet and make it available for public consumption, you should expect it to be scraped.\u201d\nWhat about the subjects of his photos? Mr. Scheufele laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to my wife about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPrivacy nihilism\u201d is an increasingly familiar term for giving up on trying to control data about oneself in the digital era. What happened to Chloe Papa could, depending on your perspective, argue for extreme vigilance or total resignation: Who could have possibly predicted that a snapshot of a toddler in 2005 would contribute, a decade and a half later, to the development of bleeding-edge surveillance technology?\n\u201cWe have become accustomed to trading convenience for privacy, so that has dulled our senses as to what is happening with all the data gathered about us,\u201d said Ms. Jones, the law professor. \u201cBut people are starting to wake up.\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/11/technology/flickr-facial-recognition.html?utm_campaign=The%20Interface&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter", "tags": [{"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.74007"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.07117"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.07088"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.05068"}, {"label": "holidays and special occasions", "score": "0.04494"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.02801"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.02453"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.02264"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02210"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01889"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.01820"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.01700"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01593"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.01569"}, {"label": "data processing (computers)", "score": "0.01538"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.01458"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01242"}, {"label": "halloween", "score": "0.01197"}, {"label": "space", "score": "0.01191"}, {"label": "computers and information systems", "score": "0.01101"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.01042"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.01012"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00988"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.00974"}, {"label": "motion pictures", "score": "0.00899"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00887"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.00886"}, {"label": "weather", "score": "0.00872"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.00803"}, {"label": "families and family life", "score": "0.00796"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Evanston", "Ill.", "Oregon", "Illinois", "China", "Russia", "Los Angeles", "Playa Vista", "Calif.", "Las Vegas", "the United States", "Illinois", "Texas", "Washington", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Chicago", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinoisans", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Texas", "Illinois", "Woodstock", "Ill.", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Illinois", "Springfield"], "ORG": ["Flickr", "Flickr", "Flickr", "Flickr", "the Biometric Information Privacy Act", "Illinoisan", "Google", "Amazon", "Mitsubishi Electric", "Tencent", "Yahoo", "Yahoo", "Creative Commons", "Flickr", "Facebook", "Google", "Yahoo", "Flickr", "The New York Times", "Flickr", "SmugMug", "Flickr", "Yahoo", "Yahoo", "Flickr", "the University of Washington", "Flickr", "MegaFace", "the University of Washington", "MegaFace", "Flickr", "the University of Washington", "Google", "Tencent", "SenseTime", "NtechLab", "Amazon", "Mitsubishi Electric", "Philips", "SenseTime", "NtechLab", "SenseTime", "MegaFace", "MegaFace", "NtechLab", "MegaFace", "Google", "the University of Washington", "MegaFace", "MegaFace", "Samsung", "Google", "Faculty Research Award", "the National Science Foundation/Intel", "Facebook", "Google", "MegaFace", "The New York Times", "MegaFace", "the University of Washington", "Flickr", "Times", "Flickr", "J.", "MegaFace", "Flickr", "Air Force Association", "CyberPatriot", "N.S.A.", "J.", "the Biometric Information Privacy Act", "the University of Illinois", "Times", "MegaFace", "Fox Rothschild", "Facebook", "Northwestern University", "Bloomberg News", "Google", "Facebook", "Facebook", "the United States Court of Appeals", "the Ninth Circuit", "Google", "Google", "City Council", "MegaFace", "Northwestern", "Amazon Web Services", "B.I.P.A.", "Philips", "the University of Washington", "MegaFace"], "PERSON": ["Chloe", "Jasper", "Chloe", "Jasper Papa", "Dominique Allman Papa", "Papas", "Papas", "Adam Harvey", "David Ayman Shamma", "Shamma", "Scott Kinzie", "Ben MacAskill", "Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman", "Steve Seitz", "Chloe", "Jasper Papa", "Harvey", "June Jin", "Jin", "Nikolay Grunin", "Kemelmacher-Shlizerman", "Barack Obama", "Nick Alt", "J.", "Alt", "Faye Jones", "Papas", "Jones", "Jeffrey Widman", "Matthew Kugler", "Kugler", "Wendy Piersall", "Kugler", "Mario Fante", "Victor Balta", "Chris Scheufele", "Scheufele", "Chloe Papa", "Jones"]}}, {"index": 687, "year": 2019, "title": "Online Cesspool Got You Down?

You Can Clean It Up, For a Price\nA new \u201cluxury internet\u201d is poised to make the online experience even more unequal than it already is.\nOnline Cesspool Got You Down?\nYou Can Clean It Up, for a Price\nA decade ago, an internet video start-up called Hulu boldly declared an end to the era of paid TV. The company announced that users would be able to watch their favorite shows over the internet, \u201canytime, anywhere, for free.\u201d\nUnderstandably, Hollywood types were taken aback. But in the \u201900s, free online TV, like free online everything else, seemed inevitable. Free was the internet\u2019s natural price, and anyone foolish enough to think they could still charge their customers was on the slow march toward extinction. Large newspapers were either pulling down their pay walls or not erecting them at all, giving in to the tech pioneer Stewart Brand\u2019s maxim that \u201cinformation wants to be free.\u201d Radiohead released a pay-what-you-want studio album, delighting the band\u2019s fans and raising eyebrows among music-industry executives. \u201cPractically everything web technology touches starts down the path to gratis,\u201d declared Wired magazine, which called free services \u201cthe future of business\u201d in a 2008 cover story.\nThe image of the internet as an egalitarian free-for-all \u2014 a place where no amount of money could buy you a superior experience, and where no lack of money could condemn you to an inferior one \u2014 persisted for years. Unlike the rest of consumer culture, the internet seemed immune to class division. Bill Gates used the same apps, visited the same websites and logged into the same social networks as the guy who mowed Bill Gates\u2019s lawn \u2014 at least in theory, anyway.\nAnd now? Well, check your credit-card statement. Today\u2019s internet is full of premium subscriptions, walled gardens and virtual V.I.P. rooms, all of which promise a cleaner, more pleasant experience than their free counterparts. The pay walls have been rebuilt, and the artists no longer work for tips. Hundreds of millions of people shell out for Netflix accounts, Patreon podcasts, Twitch streams, Spotify and news subscriptions. The average American spent more than $1,300 on digital media last year. Even Hulu pulled the plug on its free tier in 2016, giving users the choice of paying $7.99 a month or watching \u201cUgly Betty\u201d elsewhere.\n[Read about the power of Chinese apps.]\nBillions of people still use the free internet every day, of course. But it feels increasingly like wading into a sludge pit of algorithmically promoted misinformation, privacy-invading apps and subpar user experiences. Certainly not all of the internet\u2019s woes can be solved by paying your way out of them: There is no cleaner, well-lit version of Facebook in which calm policy discussions outperform racist memes, unless you count apps nobody uses. But there are more options than ever for sprucing up your digital surroundings.\nOne of these is Sift, a \u201cnews therapy\u201d app created by All Turtles, an artifical-intelligence studio based in San Francisco. The app, which costs $19.99 for six months, is billed as a way to \u201cstay informed about contentious topics while reducing anxiety and stress.\u201d Phil Libin, the chief executive of All Turtles, said the product was inspired by popular meditation apps like Calm and Headspace, as well as a desire to bring some serenity to the chaotic, sometimes overheated world of online news. \u201cI think it\u2019s becoming clear what things that are allegedly free actually cost,\u201d Libin told me. Many of the internet\u2019s cornerstone services, he added, \u201cjust seem to be more and more slimy and exploitative, and I think that people realize that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not surprising that given the choice between a free, seedy internet and a costly, orderly one, more people are opening their wallets. What is surprising is how quickly the mood has shifted. Paying for goods and services online used to mean you were an easy mark \u2014 someone too lazy or unsophisticated to figure out the necessary hacks and workarounds. Now, subscriptions are a status symbol. Models and influencers line up to join Raya, the $7.99-a-month, invitation-only dating app with an 8 percent acceptance rate and a wait list of more than 200,000 people. Image-conscious teenagers pay $19.99 a year for VSCO, which gives them more options for retouching their selfies. Class division has even come to virtual goods. A study by the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England found that Fortnite character skins \u2014 they\u2019re like costumes for your avatar \u2014 have become a source of social cachet for young kids. Poorer kids who use the free, default skin inside the game report being bullied by their peers who can afford to buy rarer ones.\nIn its early days, the internet was a great leveler. But we should have known better than to think it would stay that way. Free apps like Twitter and Facebook have become extractive mass-surveillance tools. And once the internet became the primary place where our identities are forged and performed, it was inevitable that some people would want to pay their way out of the panopticon \u2014 that escape from the very services we lusted after in recent memory would become a premium good.\nA few months ago, as research for an article, I started using a product called Superhuman, a $30-a-month email app that promises \u201cthe fastest email experience ever made.\u201d The app was a bold test of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay hundreds of dollars a year for what amounted to a fancy Gmail overlay. It enables some helpful keyboard shortcuts and some cool, if creepy, features like email tracking. I wound up feeling that Superhuman was a good product, but its premium price seemed destined to keep it a niche product for the expense-account crowd. Instead, it spawned a trend.\n\u201cI hear a new \u2018Superhuman for X\u2019 pitch every week,\u201d Jeff Morris Jr., a Los Angeles tech investor, told me recently. Morris rattled off a list of the imitators he has seen: Woven, the Superhuman for calendars; Mighty, the Superhuman for web browsers; Clay, the Superhuman for address books; and a half-dozen more ultrapremium apps aimed at the same Soylent-drinking, productivity-hacking \u201cprosumer\u201d market. Some of these apps offer concierge-level support and lengthy wait lists \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s answer to the lines outside Supreme.\nMorris characterized the earlier, more egalitarian internet as a historical anomaly, akin to the days before cable TV, when the Big Three had to make shows aimed at a broad mass market because there was no way to target narrower segments of consumers. The growth of the free, mass internet, he said, created a desire for more intimate-feeling products aimed at smaller, more elite markets. Companies had become as discerning as consumers about the tools they used, he said, and the desire to have the best possible tools created a \u201cFOMO flywheel\u201d of demand for high-end products. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had Louis Vuitton handbags,\u201d Morris explained. \u201cNow you have software that makes you feel the same way.\u201d\n\u2018You\u2019ve always had Louis Vuitton handbags. Now you have software that makes you feel the same way.\u2019\nBut unlike with a Louis Vuitton bag, the appeal of these products isn\u2019t to get you noticed \u2014 it\u2019s the opposite. People who register domain names at GoDaddy can pay $7.99 extra per year to hide their personal information from searches; virtual private networks, some costing $10 or so a month, offer an additional layer of security by masking your location and encrypting your browsing activity. True privacy hawks can spring for a premium service like Safe Shepherd or OneRep, which scour online directories for your personal information and try to have it removed. Short of moving to a mountain hideaway, there is no way to escape tracking altogether, but if you can afford it, you can draw the curtains a bit.\nBuying more expensive hardware generally helps, too. A study by Douglas Schmidt, a professor at Vanderbilt University, found that Android phones \u2014 which cost roughly one-third as much as iPhones, on average \u2014 collect roughly 10 times as much personal data. (Google has disputed the study\u2019s accuracy.) Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has been using the iPhone\u2019s privacy features as a selling point for years, calling privacy a \u201chuman right\u201d and taking shots at Google and Facebook for their ad-supported business models. At an event in March, he announced that the company\u2019s premium news app, Apple News Plus, would offer high-quality content from hundreds of leading publishers for a flat $9.99 monthly fee. Then, in one of the biggest applause lines of the day, he revealed that in addition to getting high-quality content, users of this new service would not be subject to surveillance. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what you read!\u201d Cook exclaimed. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t allow advertisers to track you!\u201d\nApple\u2019s rivals quickly pointed out that not everyone can afford a $1,000 iPhone. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed that \u201cprivacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea of a paid, ad-free Facebook, saying, \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads.\u201d These positions are self-serving, of course \u2014 a subscription-based Google or Facebook might be a much less profitable one. But they\u2019re not wrong to suggest that if privacy becomes an expensive add-on, the rich and the poor will have very different experiences of the internet.\nOne recent afternoon, I was watching some astrophysics lectures on YouTube \u2014 O.K., fine, it was an A.S.M.R. video of a guy eating chalk \u2014 when I was shown an ad for The Epoch Times, an English-language publisher funded by the persecuted Falun Gong religious sect, which is stridently anti-Beijing and supportive of right-wing politicians in the West. The ad, a lengthy diatribe about why President Trump\u2019s notional scheme to buy Greenland was a stroke of strategic genius, was full of misinformation and hyperpartisan talking points. After it finished, I got an ad for a get-rich-quick house-flipping seminar. Later, a banner appeared, telling me I could make these ads, and all other ads, go away if I paid $11.99 a month to subscribe to YouTube Premium. I\u2019d seen the banner hundreds of times before, but in the moment, it felt vaguely like extortion \u2014 as if $11.99 was the price not just of uninterrupted entertainment but also of fencing off my brain from low-rent scammers and opportunists.\nThe tech investor Marc Andreessen once said that in the future, there will be two types of people: \u201cpeople who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.\u201d It was a prescient prediction, but not in the way Andreessen meant it. He imagined a society in which computer programmers would rule over the analog masses. What\u2019s happening instead is something much less revolutionary: The programmers simply built the machines that let big corporations, powerful politicians and savvy media manipulators tell other people what to do, and they are letting rich people pay to turn those machines off.\nAs the internet moves to an A.I.-driven future, many services we use every day could learn to manipulate us in entirely new ways. In that sense, the free internet may further erode our free will. Lizzie O\u2019Shea, a technology historian and lawyer, wrote in The New Republic this year that the data mining required by the ad-supported internet amounts to \u201ca coup on our consciousness; a takeover of the parts of us that we instinctively believe ought to be under our control.\u201d A YouTube algorithm that shows you political propaganda is one thing; a YouTube algorithm that learns to personalize propaganda tailored to your specific psychological profile is another.\nTheoretically, new A.I. start-ups could compete with the giants over privacy and respect for user autonomy. But investors aren\u2019t holding their breath. \u201cIf software is meritocratic, A.I. is feudal,\u201d said Nick Beim, a partner at the venture-capital firm Venrock, which invests in A.I. start-ups. He has found that A.I. is an uphill battle for new entrants into the field, and not just because the technology is complicated. \u201cIts power depends on how much data you have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when it comes to data ownership, the large internet platforms are in a dramatically different league than everyone else.\u201d\nThe ad-based model that powers the free internet could even extend into physical spaces, as technologies like self-driving cars look for a sustaining business model. Already, Google has taken out a patent on a system that would allow advertisers to subsidize passengers\u2019 rides to their businesses. Start-ups have developed tools that would allow advertisers to suggest detours midride. (\u201cThere is an Outback Steakhouse 1.2 miles away from your destination. Would you like to stop there in exchange for a free ride today?\u201d) Several large tech companies have begun working on brain-computer interface systems that can turn thoughts into typed speech by using implanted electrodes. Facebook, which presented impressive progress this year on its own brain-reading technology, has not ruled out using this technology for advertising purposes.\nSo far, most of our hand-wringing about \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d and algorithmic sorting has taken place in the context of partisan politics. We find it disturbing that liberals and conservatives see such different news stories in their Twitter feeds, or that Google results are tailored to our preferences. But we have not fully appreciated how much of our internet experience is shaped by socioeconomic status, and the magnitude of the tax the internet imposes on lower-income users in the form of data-sucking devices and predatory ads.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you might be one of the lucky ones. Maybe you\u2019re a paying Times subscriber, or maybe you\u2019re Facebook friends with someone who is. Maybe, like me, you have an ad blocker installed on an Apple device that protects your data, you manage your browser\u2019s privacy settings carefully and you weigh the trade-offs of putting devices like the Amazon Echo in your home. But if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re already on one side of what looks to be a growing divide. And we should not confuse this version of the internet for the primary one.\nWhat the internet once promised was nothing short of complete informational equality, so that a child in Chennai would have access to the same knowledge as a child in Cleveland. But today\u2019s internet functions a lot like the physical world, with an income-based hierarchy in which everything, from the cleanliness of the water to the quality of the schools, is determined by how much you can afford to pay. It\u2019s hardly the communitarian utopia we were promised. In its current form, in fact, it threatens to exacerbate inequality and accelerate the centripetal forces already fragmenting our society.\nRumman Chowdhury, who leads Accenture\u2019s responsible-A.I. practice, put it in stark terms. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the kind of car you drive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your fundamental ability to function in society \u2014 what jobs your children will get when they grow up, what access to information they have. Quite literally, we\u2019re talking about how you view the world.\u201d\nKevin Roose is a technology columnist for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.

And so they prepared.\nThe leadership distributed a classified directive advising local officials to corner returning students as soon as they arrived and keep them quiet. It included a chillingly bureaucratic guide for how to handle their anguished questions, beginning with the most obvious: Where is my family?\nThe directive was among 403 pages of internal documents that have been shared with The New York Times in one of the most significant leaks of government papers from inside China\u2019s ruling Communist Party in decades. They provide an unprecedented inside view of the continuing clampdown in Xinjiang, in which the authorities have corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons over the past three years.\nRead the Full Document: What Chinese Officials Told Children Whose Families Were Put in Camps\nThe party has rejected international criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers that use mild methods to fight Islamic extremism. But the documents confirm the coercive nature of the crackdown in the words and orders of the very officials who conceived and orchestrated it.\nEven as the government presented its efforts in Xinjiang to the public as benevolent and unexceptional, it discussed and organized a ruthless and extraordinary campaign in these internal communications. Senior party leaders are recorded ordering drastic and urgent action against extremist violence, including the mass detentions, and discussing the consequences with cool detachment.\nChildren saw their parents taken away, students wondered who would pay their tuition and crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of manpower, the reports noted. Yet officials were directed to tell people who complained to be grateful for the Communist Party\u2019s help and stay quiet.\nThe leaked papers offer a striking picture of how the hidden machinery of the Chinese state carried out the country\u2019s most far-reaching internment campaign since the Mao era. The key disclosures in the documents include:\n\u2022 President Xi Jinping, the party chief, laid the groundwork for the crackdown in a series of speeches delivered in private to officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang in April 2014, just weeks after Uighur militants stabbed more than 150 people at a train station, killing 31. Mr. Xi called for an all-out \u201cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u201d using the \u201corgans of dictatorship,\u201d and showing \u201cabsolutely no mercy.\u201d\n\u2022 Terrorist attacks abroad and the drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan heightened the leadership\u2019s fears and helped shape the crackdown. Officials argued that attacks in Britain resulted from policies that put \u201chuman rights above security,\u201d and Mr. Xi urged the party to emulate aspects of America\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\u2022 The internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment in August 2016 of Chen Quanguo, a zealous new party boss for the region. He distributed Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches to justify the campaign and exhorted officials to \u201cround up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d\n\u2022 The crackdown encountered doubts and resistance from local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth. Mr. Chen responded by purging officials suspected of standing in his way, including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps.\nThe leaked papers consist of 24 documents, some of which contain duplicated material. They include nearly 200 pages of internal speeches by Mr. Xi and other leaders, and more than 150 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang. There are also references to plans to extend restrictions on Islam to other parts of China.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and\ncontrol of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance\nand control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of\ninternal speeches by Mr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by\nother officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports\non the surveillance and control of\nthe Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal\ninvestigations into local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages\nof internal speeches by Mr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by\nother officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports\non the surveillance and control of\nthe Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from\ninternal investigations into local\nofficials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and\ncontrol of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThough it is unclear how the documents were gathered and selected, the leak suggests greater discontent inside the party apparatus over the crackdown than previously known. The papers were brought to light by a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity and expressed hope that their disclosure would prevent party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions.\nThe Chinese leadership wraps policymaking in secrecy, especially when it comes to Xinjiang, a resource-rich territory located on the sensitive frontier with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups make up more than half the region\u2019s population of 25 million. The largest of these groups are the Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language and have long faced discrimination and restrictions on cultural and religious activities.\nBeijing has sought for decades to suppress Uighur resistance to Chinese rule in Xinjiang. The current crackdown began after a surge of antigovernment and anti-Chinese violence, including ethnic riots in 2009 in Urumqi, the regional capital, and a May 2014 attack on an outdoor market that killed 39 people just days before Mr. Xi convened a leadership conference in Beijing to set a new policy course for Xinjiang.\nSince 2017, the authorities in Xinjiang have detained many hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in internment camps. Inmates undergo months or years of indoctrination and interrogation aimed at transforming them into secular and loyal supporters of the party.\nOf the 24 documents, the directive on how to handle minority students returning home to Xinjiang in the summer of 2017 offers the most detailed discussion of the indoctrination camps \u2014 and the clearest illustration of the regimented way the party told the public one story while mobilizing around a much harsher narrative internally.\nEven as the document advises officials to inform students that their relatives are receiving \u201ctreatment\u201d for exposure to radical Islam, its title refers to family members who are being \u201cdealt with,\u201d or chuzhi, a euphemism used in party documents to mean punishment.\nOfficials in Turpan, a city in eastern Xinjiang, drafted the question-and-answer script after the regional government warned local officials to prepare for the returning students. The agency coordinating efforts to \u201cmaintain stability\u201d across Xinjiang then distributed the guide across the region and urged officials to use it as a model.\nThe government sends Xinjiang\u2019s brightest young Uighurs to universities across China, with the goal of training a new generation of Uighur civil servants and teachers loyal to the party.\nThe crackdown has been so extensive that it affected even these elite students, the directive shows. And that made the authorities nervous.\n\u201cReturning students from other parts of China have widespread social ties across the entire country,\u201d the directive noted. \u201cThe moment they issue incorrect opinions on WeChat, Weibo and other social media platforms, the impact is widespread and difficult to eradicate.\u201d\nThe authorities anticipated, however, that this was unlikely to mollify students and provided replies to a series of other questions: When will my relatives be released? If this is for training, why can\u2019t they come home? Can they request a leave? How will I afford school if my parents are studying and there is no one to work on the farm?\nThe guide recommended increasingly firm replies telling the students that their relatives had been \u201cinfected\u201d by the \u201cvirus\u201d of Islamic radicalism and must be quarantined and cured. Even grandparents and family members who seemed too old to carry out violence could not be spared, officials were directed to say.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t undergo study and training, they\u2019ll never thoroughly and fully understand the dangers of religious extremism,\u201d one answer said, citing the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State. \u201cNo matter what age, anyone who has been infected by religious extremism must undergo study.\u201d\nStudents should be grateful that the authorities had taken their relatives away, the document said.\n\u201cTreasure this chance for free education that the party and government has provided to thoroughly eradicate erroneous thinking, and also learn Chinese and job skills,\u201d one answer said. \u201cThis offers a great foundation for a happy life for your family.\u201d\nThe authorities appear to be using a scoring system to determine who can be released from the camps: The document instructed officials to tell the students that their behavior could hurt their relatives\u2019 scores, and to assess the daily behavior of the students and record their attendance at training sessions, meetings and other activities.\nSecret Speeches\nThe ideas driving the mass detentions can be traced back to Xi Jinping\u2019s first and only visit to Xinjiang as China\u2019s leader, a tour shadowed by violence.\nIn 2014, little more than a year after becoming president, he spent four days in the region, and on the last day of the trip, two Uighur militants staged a suicide bombing outside a train station in Urumqi that injured nearly 80 people, one fatally.\nWeeks earlier, militants with knives had gone on a rampage at another railway station, in southwest China, killing 31 people and injuring more than 140. And less than a month after Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, assailants tossed explosives into a vegetable market in Urumqi, wounding 94 people and killing at least 39.\nAgainst this backdrop of bloodshed, Mr. Xi delivered a series of secret speeches setting the hard-line course that culminated in the security offensive now underway in Xinjiang. While state media have alluded to these speeches, none were made public.\nThe text of four of them, though, were among the leaked documents \u2014 and they provide a rare, unfiltered look at the origins of the crackdown and the beliefs of the man who set it in motion.\n\u201cThe methods that our comrades have at hand are too primitive,\u201d Mr. Xi said in one talk, after inspecting a counterterrorism police squad in Urumqi. \u201cNone of these weapons is any answer for their big machete blades, ax heads and cold steel weapons.\u201d\n\u201cWe must be as harsh as them,\u201d he added, \u201cand show absolutely no mercy.\u201d\nIn free-flowing monologues in Xinjiang and at a subsequent leadership conference on Xinjiang policy in Beijing, Mr. Xi is recorded thinking through what he called a crucial national security issue and laying out his ideas for a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d in the region.\nAlthough he did not order mass detentions in these speeches, he called on the party to unleash the tools of \u201cdictatorship\u201d to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.\nMr. Xi displayed a fixation with the issue that seemed to go well beyond his public remarks on the subject. He likened Islamic extremism alternately to a virus-like contagion and a dangerously addictive drug, and declared that addressing it would require \u201ca period of painful, interventionary treatment.\u201d\n\u201cThe psychological impact of extremist religious thought on people must never be underestimated,\u201d Mr. Xi told officials in Urumqi on April 30, 2014, the final day of his trip to Xinjiang. \u201cPeople who are captured by religious extremism \u2014 male or female, old or young \u2014 have their consciences destroyed, lose their humanity and murder without blinking an eye.\u201d\nIn another speech, at the leadership conclave in Beijing a month later, he warned of \u201cthe toxicity of religious extremism.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as you believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s like taking a drug, and you lose your sense, go crazy and will do anything.\u201d\nIn several surprising passages, given the crackdown that followed, Mr. Xi also told officials to not discriminate against Uighurs and to respect their right to worship. He warned against overreacting to natural friction between Uighurs and Han Chinese, the nation\u2019s dominant ethnic group, and rejected proposals to try to eliminate Islam entirely in China.\n\u201cIn light of separatist and terrorist forces under the banner of Islam, some people have argued that Islam should be restricted or even eradicated,\u201d he said during the Beijing conference. He called that view \u201cbiased, even wrong.\u201d\nBut Mr. Xi\u2019s main point was unmistakable: He was leading the party in a sharp turn toward greater repression in Xinjiang.\nBefore Mr. Xi, the party had often described attacks in Xinjiang as the work of a few fanatics inspired and orchestrated by shadowy separatist groups abroad. But Mr. Xi argued that Islamic extremism had taken root across swaths of Uighur society.\nIn fact, the vast majority of Uighurs adhere to moderate traditions, though some began embracing more conservative and more public religious practices in the 1990s, despite state controls on Islam. Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks suggest he was alarmed by the revival of public piety. He blamed lax controls on religion, suggesting that his predecessors had let down their guard.\nWhile previous Chinese leaders emphasized economic development to stifle unrest in Xinjiang, Mr. Xi said that was not enough. He demanded an ideological cure, an effort to rewire the thinking of the region\u2019s Muslim minorities.\n\u201cThe weapons of the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering,\u201d Mr. Xi told the leadership conference on Xinjiang policy, which convened six days after the deadly attack on the vegetable market.\nThe Soviet Prism\nMr. Xi is the son of an early Communist Party leader who in the 1980s supported more relaxed policies toward ethnic minority groups, and some analysts had expected he might follow his father\u2019s milder ways when he assumed leadership of the party in November 2012.\nBut the speeches underscore how Mr. Xi sees risks to China through the prism of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he blamed on ideological laxity and spineless leadership.\nAcross China, he set about eliminating challenges to party rule; dissidents and human rights lawyers disappeared in waves of arrests. In Xinjiang, he pointed to examples from the former Soviet bloc to argue that economic growth would not immunize a society against ethnic separatism.\nThe Baltic republics were among the most developed in the Soviet Union but also the first to leave when the country broke up, he told the leadership conference. Yugoslavia\u2019s relative prosperity did not prevent its disintegration either, he added.\n\u201cWe say that development is the top priority and the basis for achieving lasting security, and that\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cBut it would be wrong to believe that with development every problem solves itself.\u201d\nIn the speeches, Mr. Xi showed a deep familiarity with the history of Uighur resistance to Chinese rule, or at least Beijing\u2019s official version of it, and discussed episodes rarely if ever mentioned by Chinese leaders in public, including brief periods of Uighur self-rule in the first half of the 20th century.\nViolence by Uighur militants has never threatened Communist control of the region. Though attacks grew deadlier after 2009, when nearly 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, they remained relatively small, scattered and unsophisticated.\nEven so, Mr. Xi warned that the violence was spilling from Xinjiang into other parts of China and could taint the party\u2019s image of strength. Unless the threat was extinguished, Mr. Xi told the leadership conference, \u201csocial stability will suffer shocks, the general unity of people of every ethnicity will be damaged, and the broad outlook for reform, development and stability will be affected.\u201d\nSetting aside diplomatic niceties, he traced the origins of Islamic extremism in Xinjiang to the Middle East, and warned that turmoil in Syria and Afghanistan would magnify the risks for China. Uighurs had traveled to both countries, he said, and could return to China as seasoned fighters seeking an independent homeland, which they called East Turkestan.\n\u201cAfter the United States pulls troops out of Afghanistan, terrorist organizations positioned on the frontiers of Afghanistan and Pakistan may quickly infiltrate into Central Asia,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cEast Turkestan\u2019s terrorists who have received real-war training in Syria and Afghanistan could at any time launch terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.\u201d\nMr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, responded to the 2009 riots in Urumqi with a clampdown but he also stressed economic development as a cure for ethnic discontent \u2014 longstanding party policy. But Mr. Xi signaled a break with Mr. Hu\u2019s approach in the speeches.\n\u201cIn recent years, Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis goes to show that economic development does not automatically bring lasting order and security.\u201d\nEnsuring stability in Xinjiang would require a sweeping campaign of surveillance and intelligence gathering to root out resistance in Uighur society, Mr. Xi argued.\nHe said new technology must be part of the solution, foreshadowing the party\u2019s deployment of facial recognition, genetic testing and big data in Xinjiang. But he also emphasized old-fashioned methods, such as neighborhood informants, and urged officials to study how Americans responded to the Sept. 11 attacks.\nLike the United States, he said, China \u201cmust make the public an important resource in protecting national security.\u201d\n\u201cWe Communists should be naturals at fighting a people\u2019s war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the best at organizing for a task.\u201d\nThe only suggestion in these speeches that Mr. Xi envisioned the internment camps now at the heart of the crackdown was an endorsement of more intense indoctrination programs in Xinjiang\u2019s prisons.\n\u201cThere must be effective educational remolding and transformation of criminals,\u201d he told officials in southern Xinjiang on the second day of his trip. \u201cAnd even after these people are released, their education and transformation must continue.\u201d\nWithin months, indoctrination sites began opening across Xinjiang \u2014 mostly small facilities at first, which held dozens or hundreds of Uighurs at a time for sessions intended to pressure them into disavowing devotion to Islam and professing gratitude for the party.\nThen in August 2016, a hard-liner named Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to govern Xinjiang. Within weeks, he called on local officials to \u201cremobilize\u201d around Mr. Xi\u2019s goals and declared that Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches \u201cset the direction for making a success of Xinjiang.\u201d\nNew security controls and a drastic expansion of the indoctrination camps followed.\nThe crackdown appears to have smothered violent unrest in Xinjiang, but many experts have warned that the extreme security measures and mass detentions are likely to breed resentment that could eventually inspire worse ethnic clashes.\nThe camps have been condemned in Washington and other foreign capitals. As early as the May 2014 leadership conference, though, Mr. Xi anticipated international criticism and urged officials behind closed doors to ignore it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid if hostile forces whine, or if hostile forces malign the image of Xinjiang,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Round Up Everyone\u2019\nThe documents show there was more resistance to the crackdown inside the party than previously known \u2014 and highlight the key role that the new party boss in Xinjiang played in overcoming it.\nMr. Chen led a campaign akin to one of Mao\u2019s turbulent political crusades, in which top-down pressure on local officials encouraged overreach and any expression of doubt was treated as a crime.\nIn February 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at attention in a vast square in Urumqi to prepare for a \u201csmashing, obliterating offensive.\u201d In the following weeks, the documents indicate, the leadership settled on plans to detain Uighurs in large numbers.\nMr. Chen issued a sweeping order: \u201cRound up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d The vague phrase appears repeatedly in internal documents from 2017.\nThe party had previously used the phrase \u2014 \u201cying shou jin shou\u201d in Chinese \u2014 when demanding that officials be vigilant and comprehensive in collecting taxes or measuring harvests. Now it was being applied to humans in directives that ordered, with no mention of judicial procedures, the detention of anyone who displayed \u201csymptoms\u201d of religious radicalism or antigovernment views.\nThe authorities laid out dozens of such signs, including common behavior among devout Uighurs such as wearing long beards, giving up smoking or drinking, studying Arabic and praying outside mosques.\nParty leaders reinforced the orders with warnings about terrorism abroad and potential copycat attacks in China.\nThe number of people swept into the camps remains a closely guarded secret. But one of the leaked documents offers a hint of the scale of the campaign: It instructed officials to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in crowded facilities.\n\u2018I Broke the Rules\u2019\nThe orders were especially urgent and contentious in Yarkand County, a collection of rural towns and villages in southern Xinjiang where nearly all of the 900,000 residents are Uighur.\nIn the 2014 speeches, Mr. Xi had singled out southern Xinjiang as the front line in his fight against religious extremism. Uighurs make up close to 90 percent of the population in the south, compared to just under half in Xinjiang over all, and Mr. Xi set a long-term goal of attracting more Han Chinese settlers.\nHe and other party leaders ordered a quasi-military organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to accelerate efforts to settle the area with more Han Chinese, the documents show.\nA few months later, more than 100 Uighur militants armed with axes and knives attacked a government office and police station in Yarkand, killing 37 people, according to government reports. In the battle, the security forces shot dead 59 assailants, the reports said.\nAn official named Wang Yongzhi was appointed to run Yarkand soon afterward. With his glasses and crew cut, he looked the picture of a party technocrat. He had grown up and spent his career in southern Xinjiang and was seen as a deft, seasoned official who could deliver on the party\u2019s top priorities in the area: economic development and firm control of the Uighurs.\nBut among the most revealing documents in the leaked papers are two that describe Mr. Wang\u2019s downfall \u2014 an 11-page report summarizing the party\u2019s internal investigation into his actions, and the text of a 15-page confession that he may have given under duress. Both were distributed inside the party as a warning to officials to fall in line behind the crackdown.\nHan officials like Mr. Wang serve as the party\u2019s anchors in southern Xinjiang, watching over Uighur officials in more junior positions, and he seemed to enjoy the blessing of top leaders, including Yu Zhengsheng, then China\u2019s most senior official for ethnic issues, who visited the county in 2015.\nMr. Wang set about beefing up security in Yarkand but he also pushed economic development to address ethnic discontent. And he sought to soften the party\u2019s religious policies, declaring that there was nothing wrong with having a Quran at home and encouraging party officials to read it to better understand Uighur traditions.\nWhen the mass detentions began, Mr. Wang did as he was told at first and appeared to embrace the task with zeal.\nHe built two sprawling new detention facilities, including one as big as 50 basketball courts, and herded 20,000 people into them.\nHe sharply increased funding for the security forces in 2017, more than doubling spending on outlays such as checkpoints and surveillance to 1.37 billion renminbi, or about $180 million.\nAnd he lined up party members for a rally in a public square and urged them to press the fight against terrorists. \u201cWipe them out completely,\u201d he said. \u201cDestroy them root and branch.\u201d\nBut privately, Mr. Wang had misgivings, according to the confession that he later signed, which would have been carefully vetted by the party.\nHe was under intense pressure to prevent an outburst of violence in Yarkand, and worried the crackdown would provoke a backlash.\nThe authorities set numeric targets for Uighur detentions in parts of Xinjiang, and while it is unclear if they did so in Yarkand, Mr. Wang felt the orders left no room for moderation and would poison ethnic relations in the county.\nHe also worried that the mass detentions would make it impossible to record the economic progress he needed to earn a promotion.\nThe leadership had set goals to reduce poverty in Xinjiang. But with so many working-age residents being sent to the camps, Mr. Wang was afraid the targets would be out of reach, along with his hopes for a better job.\nHis superiors, he wrote, were \u201coverly ambitious and unrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cThe policies and measures taken by higher levels were at gaping odds with realities on the ground and could not be implemented in full,\u201d he added.\nTo help enforce the crackdown in southern Xinjiang, Mr. Chen transferred in hundreds of officials from the north. Publicly, Mr. Wang welcomed the 62 assigned to Yarkand. Privately, he seethed that they did not understand how to work with local officials and residents.\nThe pressure on officials in Xinjiang to detain Uighurs and prevent fresh violence was relentless, and Mr. Wang said in the confession \u2014 presumably signed under pressure \u2014 that he drank on the job. He described one episode in which he collapsed drunk during a meeting on security.\n\u201cWhile reporting on my work in the afternoon meeting, I rambled incoherently,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d just spoken a few sentences and my head collapsed on the table. It became the biggest joke across the whole prefecture.\u201d\nThousands of officials in Xinjiang were punished for resisting or failing to carry out the crackdown with sufficient zeal. Uighur officials were accused of protecting fellow Uighurs, and Gu Wensheng, the Han leader of another southern county, was jailed for trying to slow the detentions and shield Uighur officials, according to the documents.\nSecret teams of investigators traveled across the region identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang for infractions in the \u201cfight against separatism,\u201d more than 20 times the figure in the previous year, according to official statistics.\nMr. Wang may have gone further than any other official.\nQuietly, he ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates \u2014 an act of defiance for which he would be detained, stripped of power and prosecuted.\nBrazen Defiance\nMr. Wang quietly disappeared from public view after September 2017.\nAbout six months later, the party made an example of him, announcing that he was being investigated for \u201cgravely disobeying the party central leadership\u2019s strategy for governing Xinjiang.\u201d\nThe internal report on the investigation was more direct. \u201cHe should have given his all to serving the party,\u201d it said. \u201cInstead, he ignored the party central leadership\u2019s strategy for Xinjiang, and he went as far as brazen defiance.\u201d\nBoth the report and Mr. Wang\u2019s confession were read aloud to officials across Xinjiang. The message was plain: The party would not tolerate any hesitation in carrying out the mass detentions.\nPropaganda outlets described Mr. Wang as irredeemably corrupt, and the internal report accused him of taking bribes on construction and mining deals and paying off superiors to win promotions.\nThe authorities also emphasized he was no friend of Uighurs. To hit poverty-reduction targets, he was said to have forced 1,500 families to move into unheated apartments in the middle of the winter.

No one is beyond the reach of this constant digital surveillance. Not even the president of the United States.\nThe Times Privacy Project obtained a dataset with more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million people in this country. It was a random sample from 2016 and 2017, but it took only minutes \u2014 with assistance from publicly available information \u2014 for us to deanonymize location data and track the whereabouts of President Trump.\nA single dot appeared on the screen, representing the precise location of someone in President Trump\u2019s entourage at 7:10 a.m. It lingered around the grounds of the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president was staying, for about an hour.\nThen it was on the move.\nThe dot traveled to the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, about 30 minutes north of the hotel, pinging again at 9:24 a.m. just outside the compound. The president was there to play golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.\nThere the dot stayed until at least 1:12 p.m., when it moved to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where the world leaders enjoyed a private lunch.\nBy 5:08 p.m., the phone was back at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe president had what he called a working dinner with Mr. Abe that night.\nThe device\u2019s owner was easy to trace, revealing the outline of the person\u2019s work and life. The same phone pinged a dozen times at the nearby Secret Service field office and events with elected officials. From computer screens more than 1,000 miles away, we could watch the person travel from exclusive areas at Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago.\n[Related: Where Even the Children Are Being Tracked \u2014 We followed every move of people in one city. Then we went to tell them.]\nThe meticulous movements \u2014 down to a few feet \u2014 of the president\u2019s entourage were recorded by a smartphone we believe belonged to a Secret Service agent, whose home was also clearly identifiable in the data. Connecting the home to public deeds revealed the person\u2019s name, along with the name of the person\u2019s spouse, exposing even more details about both families. We could also see other stops this person made, apparently more connected with his private life than his public duties. The Secret Service declined to comment on our findings or describe its policies regarding location data.\nThe vulnerability of the person we tracked in Mr. Trump\u2019s entourage is one that many if not all of us share: the apps (weather services, maps, perhaps even something as mundane as a coupon saver) collecting and sharing his location on his phone.\nAmericans have grown eerily accustomed to being tracked throughout their digital lives. But it\u2019s far from their fault. It\u2019s a result of a system in which data surveillance practices are hidden from consumers and in which much of the collection of information is done without the full knowledge of the device holders.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nFor the nation\u2019s security agencies, however, privacy is critical to the safety of military, defense and security operations across the country and abroad. If threats to that privacy have seemed abstract in the past, the trove of location data we have analyzed has brought them into sharp relief. Military and intelligence officials have long been concerned about how their movements could be exposed; now every move is. As a senior Defense Department official told Times Opinion, even the Pentagon has told employees to expect that their privacy is compromised:\n\u201cWe want our people to understand: They should make no assumptions about anonymity. You are not anonymous on this planet at this point in our existence. Everyone is trackable, traceable, discoverable to some degree.\u201d\nWe were able to track smartphones in nearly every major government building and facility in Washington. We could follow them back to homes and, ultimately, their owners\u2019 true identities. Even a prominent senator\u2019s national security adviser \u2014 someone for whom privacy and security are core to their every working day \u2014 was identified and tracked in the data.\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhile the Constitution prevents companies from sharing location data with the government without a warrant, there are no federal protections limiting how they use or share it privately. No such protections are currently being debated before Congress \u2014 even though we found that we could track people through Congress\u2019s own halls as easily as any place else.\nWhen we reached out to some lawmakers to show what we found, the outrage proved bipartisan.\n\u201cThis is terrifying,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for the federal government take a tougher stance with tech companies. \u201cIt is terrifying not just because of the major national security implications, what Beijing could get ahold of. But it also raises personal privacy concerns for individuals and families. These companies are tracking our kids.\u201d\n\u201cTech companies are profiting by spying on Americans \u2014 trampling on the right to privacy and risking our national security,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, told us. \u201cThey are throwing around their power to undermine our democracy with zero consequences. This report is another alarming case for why we need to break up big tech, adopt serious privacy regulations and hold top executives of these companies personally responsible.\u201d\nAgencies can limit how their employees use location-sharing apps and services, but that doesn\u2019t mean those guidelines will be strictly enforced \u2014 or extended to personal devices.\nBut no matter how comprehensive an organization\u2019s policies and regulations are, getting everyone to follow them is nearly impossible as many of these apps' surveillance practices are not visible to consumers.\n\u201cThe human being is the weak link,\u201d said Martijn Rasser, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who is now a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to enforce a lot of these rules and regulations. Sometimes, all it takes is one person to violate the rules to completely negate the purpose of having those rules in the first place.\u201d\nDespite the sensitivity of this information, it is put to everyday use. Packaged with millions of other data points, location information is turned into marketing analysis and sold to financial institutions, real estate investors, advertising companies and others. Companies say they vet partners carefully and tend to work with larger players that have a clear business case for receiving the data.\nLike all data, the vast location files are vulnerable to hacks, leaks or sale at any point along that process. The data we reviewed was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so.\nMultiple experts with ties to the United States\u2019 national security agencies warned in interviews that foreign actors like Russia, North Korea, China and other adversaries may be working to steal, buy or otherwise obtain this kind of data. Only months ago, hackers working for the Chinese government allegedly targeted location data for people moving throughout Asia by breaking into telecom networks, according to a report by Reuters.\n\u201cPeople literally go to work every day, sit down at a desk, check the sports, send an email or two to their girlfriend and then start looking for databases they can steal,\u201d said James Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. \u201cThey just do that 9 to 5, every day.\u201d\nThe American government may conduct similar intelligence operations against its adversaries, experts said, though under stricter legal frameworks.\nUsing the data, we identified people in positions of power by following smartphone pings as they moved around the White House, Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court and other government facilities. In many cases, the data trails led back to the smartphone users\u2019 homes. In this series, we did not name any of the identified people without their permission. And the data below has been obscured to protect device owners.\nSenior Officials and Security Staff\nData has been obscured to protect device owners.\nSecret Service agent\nSecret Service agent\nTechnology at the Supreme Court\nDepartment of Defense official\nDirector at a House committee\nAdvisor for a Senator\nConnecting a ping to a person was as easy as combining home and work locations with public information. A seemingly random set of movements turned into a clear individual pattern after we added just one other piece of information.\nPlenty of corroborating information is already floating around dark corners of the web, given the frequent high-profile data breaches of the past decade. Consider what China already knows: In 2015, a federal database containing the personal information of more than four million people with security clearances was stolen by Chinese hackers presumed to be state actors.\n\u201cFrom those very detailed documents, they may gather a good deal of information about a person,\u201d said David S. Kris, a co-founder of the consulting firm Culper Partners and former assistant attorney general for the national security division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Kris said he was also included in the data that was hacked. \u201cThe more you can combine location-based data into a mosaic with other information, the more likely you are to gain real insight into an adversary.\u201d\nLocation data potentially gives any enemy an opening for attack. Russians, whose intelligence apparatus has worked for decades to disrupt American democracy, could simply leak location information to embarrass the government, the legal system or particular officials.\n\u201cThink about Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine public trust and confidence in our democratic institutions,\u201d Suzanne Spaulding, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, told us. \u201cThink about all of the ways they could use location data to do that. Think about tracking judges everywhere they went and how you could use that to undermine confidence in our courts and our justice system.\u201d\nAfter Ms. Spaulding raised the danger of tracking judges, we checked the data file for courthouse employees. In minutes, we found dozens of potential targets by watching smartphones sharing their precise locations inside Washington courthouses. One person whose movements we traced has a role in the technology division, which controls servers containing data for the Supreme Court.\nFor people with political power, knowing those locations could put their safety \u2014 and our national security \u2014 at risk. Experts told Times Opinion that foreign governments could use the data to monitor sensitive sites and identify people with access to them, and their associates.\n\u201cNot everybody in the department has a national security position, not everybody has access to classified or higher-level stuff,\u201d the senior Defense official said. \u201cBut everyone in the department is of some interest or value to a lot of adversaries just by virtue of being a member of the Defense Department, just by working at the Pentagon.\u201d\nat the Pentagon\nThe possibilities for blackmail are endless. Once stolen, details on sexual interests and extramarital affairs can provide opportunities for extortion. Targets could be coerced in ways large and small, compelled to make decisions or take actions for a foreign government. Or the locations themselves could provide valuable intelligence about security practices, contacts, schedules and the identities of people in prominent and sensitive posts, with access to state secrets or critical infrastructure.\nWith no training and far more limited technical tools than those of a state intelligence service, we were able to use the location data \u2014 date, time and length of stay \u2014 to make basic inferences. By determining whether two people were in the same place at the same time, it was easy to zero in on spouses, co-workers or friends. Cataloguing their movements revealed even more associations, creating the map of a robust social network that would be nearly impossible to determine through traditional surveillance. In cases where it was difficult to identify an individual, associations offered more clues about workplaces and interests.\nIn one case, it proved difficult to confirm the identity of a man listed in public records who had a common name. Examining his associations revealed that he met multiple times with someone carrying another phone that was being tracked. That person was, we soon learned, his brother. That piece of information doubled the pool of digital breadcrumbs to follow, ultimately helping confirm both of their identities.\nNow consider elections. Bad actors could monitor candidates and elected leaders for intelligence that could be leaked or used to blackmail them. There are also no regulations limiting how long location data can be stored. Data swept up today may prove valuable in the future, as everyday citizens rise to positions of authority and influence only to have their precise movements from years gone by reviewed for damaging insights.\nDefense contractors and employees at secure locations like power plants are all at risk.\nWe found smartphone pings at all of these sorts of sites. In one case, someone who spent their weekdays at the Pentagon visited a mental health and substance abuse facility multiple times.\nEven just commuting to work can be risky for people in prominent positions. \u201cThe easiest way to figure out how to get to you is know you always have the same routine,\u201d said Mr. Rasser, the former Central Intelligence Agency officer. He said he mixes up his own routine, partly because the C.I.A. emphasized such methods when he joined.\nThe threats will only grow as more data is collected and shared. More apps will enter the marketplace using tracking technology. And companies are becoming more sophisticated at collecting location data, adding signals from Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons. They also often rely on one-time consent or disclosures that don\u2019t explicitly state what\u2019s collected or shared.\nExperts emphasized how location data has joined many other kinds of sensitive information in the espionage toolkit, showing how intelligence agencies must continually adapt to the digital age.\n\u201cWe need to learn to operate with fewer secrets,\u201d Ms. Spaulding said.\nEven areas once thought to be secure showed up in the data. Personal phones aren\u2019t generally allowed inside the C.I.A. or the National Security Agency. But while no pings registered inside the C.I.A. headquarters, we found thousands of pings in the parking lots outside, with trails that led to the homes of likely employees.\nSimilarly, there were no blackout areas in many sensitive government buildings. We observed thousands of pings inside the Pentagon, on military bases, in F.B.I. headquarters and in Secret Service facilities across the country. (Intelligence facilities also have secure areas where certain electronic devices aren\u2019t permitted.)\nThe risks posed by location-tracking remain largely unaddressed by the government. Beginning last year, the Department of Defense prohibited geolocation features and functionality from being used by its workers on devices in \u201coperational areas\u201d like foreign military bases. For all other locations, the department said it would consider the risks and issue specific recommendations to personnel.\nFor now, the department does not issue guidance to employees about downloading specific apps, including those that might share location data with third parties. \u201cInstead, we focused on certain core characteristics of the geolocation functionality and identified what risks those characteristics posed,\u201d a department spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said in an email.\nAgencies with a need for heightened security are left in a vulnerable position. Phones are ubiquitous, and so long as granular location tracking remains legal, even the Defense Department must play along. \u201cWe cannot stop our workforce of 3.6 million people from living their everyday lives,\u201d a senior department official told us.\nWe haven\u2019t identified any serving elected representatives in our data, but we found a former House representative and dozens of prominent public officials, including chiefs of staff, security officials and subcommittee staff members.\nGiven their proximity to public figures with public schedules and their presence at training sites and field offices, Secret Service agents were particularly easy to identify. With little difficulty, we were able to track a Secret Service agent who spent most of his daytime hours in the West Wing of the White House. He also joined President Trump at the National Cathedral the day after the inauguration.\nJames J. Rowley Training Center\nWhile the data reviewed by Times Opinion is from three years ago, similar information is being collected daily and often resold to third parties, meaning anyone with current access to such data could feasibly, in near real time, track people within arm\u2019s reach of the president or other powerful figures.\n\u201cIf you want to take action against someone, you have to find them first,\u201d said Mr. Kris, the former Department of Justice official. \u201cI\u2019m wary of breathless, pearl-clutching, speculative, sensationalistic counterintelligence concerns. This doesn\u2019t strike me as falling into that category. I think there is a legitimate concern here.\u201d\nLeaked location data may open the door to other cyber vulnerabilities. Foreign actors could learn movement details and infer meeting locations, which could be used to conduct a type of scam where targets receive fake emails \u2014 posing as a friend you just met with or a business you just visited \u2014 including a phony link meant to steal your password or install malware.\n\u201cLocation tracking data of individuals can be used to facilitate reconnaissance, recruitment, social engineering, extortion and in worst-case scenarios, things like kidnapping and assassination,\u201d warned Kelli Vanderlee, manager of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity company FireEye.\nThose are not theoretical threats. The phone of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in 2018, was allegedly compromised, possibly allowing his location data to be used to follow him.\nLast year, Strava, a company that makes a fitness app, released a global map showing 700 million activities that clearly revealed American military bases abroad. The Department of Defense issued its recent guidance after discovering the problem. The data reviewed by Times Opinion revealed several points on domestic military bases as well, showing how some of the nation\u2019s most secure armed sites can be exposed.\n\u201cAn adversary can still glean a lot from your whereabouts on the base itself,\u201d said Mr. Rasser, the former C.I.A. officer. \u201cIf you\u2019re always at a certain part of the base, at a certain time, you can start piecing together what the function of that corner of the base could be based on the person\u2019s job duties.\u201d\nUsing base locations as a guide, Times Opinion accurately surmised the job title of a commander in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He regularly traveled to the Pentagon and visited Joint Base Andrews, perhaps best known as the home of the president\u2019s airliner, Air Force One.\nAndrews\nIt\u2019s not necessary for someone to visit sensitive locations to be open to scrutiny or criticism. Location data could become a powerful political tool, exposing the private lives of wealthy elites who prefer to adopt a more egalitarian persona. It is not difficult to imagine efforts to undermine a political campaign by exposing travels through private airports or visits to expensive restaurants and luxurious spas.\nThe sources who provided the trove of location information to Times Opinion did so to press for regulation and increased scrutiny of the location data market. Some solutions exist that could help improve privacy while ensuring businesses can still perform some of the analysis they do today, like limiting the ability to identify individual paths, changing how long the information is stored and limiting how it\u2019s sold.\nSo far, Washington has done virtually nothing to address the threats, and location data companies have every reason to keep refining their tracking, sucking up more data and selling it to the highest bidders.\nStuart A.

We Made It Visible.\nImmense amounts of methane are escaping from oil and gas sites nationwide, worsening global warming, even as the Trump administration weakens restrictions on offenders.\nImmense amounts of methane are escaping from oil and gas sites nationwide, worsening global warming, even as the Trump administration weakens restrictions on offenders.\nTo the naked eye, there is nothing out of the ordinary at the DCP Pegasus gas processing plant in West Texas, one of the thousands of installations in the vast Permian Basin that have transformed America into the largest oil and gas producer in the world.\nBut a highly specialized camera sees what the human eye cannot: a major release of methane, the main component of natural gas and a potent greenhouse gas that is helping to warm the planet at an alarming rate.\nTwo New York Times journalists detected this from a tiny plane, crammed with scientific equipment, circling above the oil and gas sites that dot the Permian, an oil field bigger than Kansas. In just a few hours, the plane\u2019s instruments identified six sites with unusually high methane emissions.\nMethane is loosely regulated, difficult to detect and rising sharply. The Times\u2019s aerial and on-the-ground research, along with an examination of lobbying activities by the companies that own the sites, shows how the energy industry is seeking and winning looser federal regulations on methane, a major contributor to global warming.\nOperators of the sites identified by The Times are among the very companies that have lobbied the Trump administration, either directly or through trade organizations, to weaken regulations on methane, a review of regulatory filings, meeting minutes and attendance logs shows. These local companies, along with oil-industry lobby groups that represent the world\u2019s largest energy companies, are fighting rules that would force them to more aggressively fix emissions like these.\nNext year, the administration could move forward with a plan that would effectively eliminate requirements that oil companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from oil and gas facilities. By the E.P.A.\u2019s own calculations, the rollback would increase methane emissions by 370,000 tons through 2025, enough to power more than a million homes for a year.\nIn the air, Times reporters surveyed an area in and around two counties in the heart of the Permian with the help of specialists in methane detection.\n\u201cThis site\u2019s definitely leaking,\u201d said Paolo Wilczak, a scientist and the pilot of the two-seater aircraft, as a laptop monitor hooked up to the equipment registered a blip in methane levels. \u201cAnd that one, too.\u201d\nThe reporters drove to the sites armed with infrared video gear that revealed methane billowing from tanks, seeping from pipes and wafting from bright flares that are designed to burn off the gas, but sometimes fail to do so completely. At one site, a worker walked directly into a methane plume unprotected.\nTim Doty, a former senior official at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality who is trained in infrared leak detection, examined and helped analyze the findings. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy amount of emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a little bit of investigative work, but with an infrared camera, you can see it.\u201d\nOil and gas companies were committed to driving down emissions \u201cwhile delivering affordable, reliable energy to American families,\u201d said Howard Feldman, senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, a major industry lobby group. Its members believed that regulations should be improved, however, to provide clarity for businesses, avoid duplicating state rules and drive industry innovation, he said.\nThe regulatory rollback sought by the energy industry is the latest chapter in the administration\u2019s historic effort to weaken environmental and climate regulations while waging a broad-based attack on climate science.\nScientists say that, in weakening the rules, the Trump administration underestimates methane\u2019s global climate effects. It also disregards research that suggests methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure are far larger than previously estimated.\nThe findings address the mystery behind rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Methane levels have soared since 2007 for reasons that still aren\u2019t fully understood. But fracking natural-gas production, which accelerated just as atmospheric methane levels jumped, is a prime suspect.\nMethane leaks from oil and gas production threaten to erode the advantage that natural gas has over coal in meeting the world\u2019s energy needs, scientists say. When burned for electricity, natural gas produces about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. But if methane is not burned off when released, it can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\nMethane also contributes to ground-level ozone, which, if inhaled, can cause asthma and other health problems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that fossil fuel production has dramatically increased global methane emissions,\u201d said Robert Howarth, an earth system scientist at Cornell University and author of a study estimating that North American shale gas production may be responsible for about a third of the global increase in methane emissions over the past decade.\nA bright red-and-white plane pirouetted above the Texas scrub, banking so sharply it were as if the tiny aircraft was spinning on a wingtip. Mr. Wilczak, a pilot and flight scientist for Scientific Aviation, an aerial leak-detection company, executed tight circles above an oil installation.\nTiny tubes affixed to the wings siphoned air to a sensitive spectrometer, jammed behind the seats, capable of detecting and measuring methane. Mr. Wilczak said it takes about seven seconds for the air to pass through and register a reading on a computer balanced on the lap of the only passenger.\nDetecting methane emissions is difficult work that often begins with flights like these. Oil and gas sites are not required to install round-the-clock emissions monitors, and flights are one of the ways to spot trouble.\nIn the course of about four hours of flying, we found at least six sites with high methane-emissions readings, ranging from about 300 pounds to almost 1,100 pounds an hour, including at DCP Pegasus, which is part owned by the energy giant Phillips 66.\nThose readings would very likely put those sites in the category of \u201csuper emitters,\u201d a term used by scientists to describe large-scale releases that are responsible for a disproportionately high share of methane emissions from oil and gas sites. In a 2017 study of the Barnett shale basin in Texas, methane releases of about 60 pounds or more an hour were classified as super emitters, making up just 1 percent of sites but accounting for nearly half of total emissions.\nIn an aerial survey, Times reporters found six methane \u201csuper emitters.\u201d The gray line indicates their flight path.\nNORTH\nODESSA\n2 MILES\nPermian\nBasin\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n1,077\n452\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Driver Plant\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\nODESSA\n2 MILES\nPermian\nBasin\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n452\n1,077\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nTarga Driver Plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\nPermian\nBasin\n5 MILES\nODESSA\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n452\n1,077\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nTarga Driver Plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\n5 MILES\nDetail\nTEXAS\nPermian\nBasin\n678\nLBS METHANE/HR\nNewberry gas plant\n664\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nSurvey\nflight path\n1,077\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Driver Plant\n315\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n298\nThe region is\ndotted with\noil and gas\ninfrastructure\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n452\nLBS METHANE/HR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nNORTH\n5 MILES\nDetail\nTEXAS\nPermian\nBasin\n678\nLBS METHANE/HR\nNewberry gas plant\n664\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nSurvey\nflight path\n1,077\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Driver Plant\n315\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n298\nThe region is\ndotted with\noil and gas\ninfrastructure\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n452\nLBS METHANE/HR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nBy Denise Lu | Sources: Scientific Aviation and Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite.\nOn the ground, the Permian is a landscape of parched cotton fields, bobbing pump jacks and dirt roads that stretch for miles. We drove out to photograph the emissions we had detected from the air with a specialized infrared camera fitted with a lens made not of glass, but metal.\nAt the DCP Pegasus plant, south of Midland, the camera transformed a tranquil scene into a furnace. Hot columns of gas shot into the air. Fumes engulfed structures.\nThe camera sees several types of gases, including methane and ethane, both greenhouse gases, as well as pollutants called volatile organic compounds. Any emissions are likely to contain a mixture of the gases. Mr. Doty, who now runs a consultancy, said the emissions appeared to be from vapor combustors, compressors and storage tanks.\nAccording to Texas regulatory records, DCP has reported more than 250 unpermitted emissions events this year in the Permian Basin and is among the area\u2019s bigger emitters. State rules allow facilities to report irregular emissions without penalties.\nSarah Sandberg, a spokeswoman for DCP, which operates several pipelines and almost 50 gas processing plants nationwide, said she had \u201cmany questions regarding the accuracy of your assessment and assumptions.\u201d She did not respond to repeated follow-ups.\nPhillips 66 declined to comment.\nAt the EagleClaw Midstream gas processing plant just south of Pecos, we found emissions spewing from the top of a wastewater tank. The plant\u2019s manager, Justin Bishop, walked over to look at what we were filming. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was leaking,\u201d he said.\nA worker went to check on the tank, climbing some stairs and walking into the plume.\nHe said the emissions were simply water vapor. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t reporting it.\u201d\nBut Mr. Doty, the former Texas emissions regulator, said water vapor would have been visible to the naked eye. \u201cThat isn\u2019t water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of emissions.\u201d\nIn a statement, EagleClaw said its workers had discovered that the tank\u2019s valve did require maintenance and that the problem had been fixed 30 minutes later.\n\u201cThe amount of gas that leaked was determined, by our experts, to be well below any legal reportable limits,\u201d Todd Carpenter, the company\u2019s chief compliance officer, said in an email. He added that the safety and security of EagleClaw\u2019s employees, and of the public, \u201cwas of primary concern.\u201d The company has not filed an emissions event report this year.\nAs early as March 2017 \u2014 just months after the presidential inauguration \u2014 fossil fuel companies made contact with the Trump administration to argue for a rollback of methane emissions rules.\nThey held repeated meetings with federal officials, including an important one in November 2018, when lobbyists for DCP, EagleClaw and other oil processing companies met with officials from the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss a critical topic: unintended or \u201cfugitive\u201d methane emissions.\nRepresentatives of the lobby group, GPA Midstream, argued that the E.P.A. should relax monitoring requirements for fugitive emissions at gathering and compressor facilities, according to regulatory records reviewed by The Times. GPA Midstream met with Trump administration officials at least three times on the matter.\n\u201cMore frequent monitoring would not be cost-effective,\u201d GPA lobbyists later said in comments filed with the agency, and stricter regulation was \u201ccostly and burdensome.\u201d\nThe efforts were part of a broader industry push to reverse Obama-era rules that would have forced operators to more aggressively monitor and repair natural gas leaks while reducing flaring.\nEarlier, at a March 2018 meeting, lobbyists for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents thousands of oil and gas companies nationwide, circulated material that forcefully rebutted the scientific evidence of large fugitive emissions from drilling sites. The lobbyists said the data \u201ccreate the illusion\u201d that super emitters pose a problem, according to a handout from the meeting.\nThe petroleum association vice president, Lee O. Fuller, said in an interview that for smaller operators, which often run low-producing wells, the costs of excessive regulations could be crippling. They \u201ccould put many out of business,\u201d he said.\nThe companies found an administration willing to listen. Before his appointment to the post of assistant administrator at the E.P.A. overseeing air pollution, William L. Wehrum lobbied on behalf of oil and gas producers, including gas processors and petroleum refineries.\nMr. Wehrum resigned from the agency in June and is under investigation for his contacts with former clients. His former boss, Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, also lobbied for energy companies earlier in his career.\nBy this August, the E.P.A. had proposed a broad rollback, including rescinding direct regulations of methane emissions completely. Volatile organic compounds, a separate but related category of gases, would remain regulated, which would have a side effect of limiting some methane emissions.\nIn a statement, an E.P.A. spokesman, Michael Abboud, said methane was a valuable resource, so the industry already \u201chas an incentive to minimize leaks.\u201d He added that E.P.A. staff members work with ethics officials \u201cto ensure they are in compliance with all ethics rules.\u201d Mr. Wehrum did not respond to a request for comment.\nEnergy giants including BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell have, to varying degrees, publicly supported methane regulation. However, trade associations representing all three, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America, have fought against direct regulation.\nA spokesman for BP said the company wanted to maintain the direct regulation of methane, and an official from Exxon said the company was making voluntary efforts to reduce methane, including infrastructure upgrades. A Chevron spokesman, Sean Comey, said the company \u201csupports global efforts to reduce flaring and methane emissions.\u201d Shell said it supported the continued direct regulation of methane and more frequent leak inspections.\nSome companies are starting to use infrared cameras, drones and other technology to detect methane leaks. BP said recently it would use drones and surveillance cameras to monitor for fugitive emissions at new oil and gas projects. Shell is testing solar-powered technology to watch for leaks.\nAs the boom-and-bust oil business goes through another one of its financial gyrations \u2014 production in the Permian is expected to slow as a glut of gas and rock-bottom prices take their toll \u2014 there are concerns that investments in methane detection won\u2019t be a priority, particularly for smaller operators.\nOne site where we identified leakage with the infrared camera was an unmanned well pad with a battery of gray tanks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of volume coming out of there,\u201d Mr. Doty later said of the images. \u201cIf this is going 100 percent of the time, that\u2019s a lot of emissions.\u201d\nThe site was owned by MDC Texas Operator, which we discovered had filed for bankruptcy that very day.\nCalls to the company went unanswered, and its bankruptcy lawyers didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It is unknown whether the tank is still spewing gas.\nFor more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\nProduced by Matt Ruby\nAbout the infrared video\nTo create images of methane emissions in the Permian Basin, The Times used a custom-built FLIR camera that converts infrared energy into an electronic signal to create moving pictures. The camera\u2019s filter allows infrared wavelengths between 3.2 to 3.4 micrometers on the electromagnetic spectrum to pass through to the sensor.\nTo visualize gas, the camera uses helium to cool down the sensor to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, around minus 200 degrees Celsius. Unlike traditional photography lenses, which are glass, the infrared images were created using metal lenses made from germanium, which is transparent at infrared wavelengths.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/12/climate/texas-methane-super-emitters.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&utm_source=1500+CWP+List+Daily+Clips+and+Updates&utm_campaign=509ecdfd8d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_12_12_09_06&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_4369a4e737-509ecdfd8d-84301401", "tags": [{"label": "environment", "score": "0.36273"}, {"label": "global warming", "score": "0.25866"}, {"label": "oil (petroleum) and gasoline", "score": "0.23694"}, {"label": "gas (fuel)", "score": "0.21057"}, {"label": "energy and power", "score": "0.20964"}, {"label": "weather", "score": "0.12183"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.09291"}, {"label": "air pollution", "score": "0.07076"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.05004"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.03666"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.03177"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.02671"}, {"label": "chemistry", "score": "0.02012"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.01975"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01891"}, {"label": "terms not available", "score": "0.01684"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.01418"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.01383"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01379"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.01228"}, {"label": "carbon dioxide", "score": "0.01192"}, {"label": "light", "score": "0.01011"}, {"label": "catalytic converters", "score": "0.01001"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00947"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.00902"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.00877"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.00849"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00745"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.00723"}, {"label": "automobiles", "score": "0.00673"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["West Texas", "America", "Kansas", "Texas", "Texas", "TEXAS", "TEXAS", "NORTH", "TEXAS", "NORTH", "TEXAS", "NORTH", "TEXAS", "Midland", "Texas", "Texas"], "ORG": ["DCP Pegasus", "New York Times", "Methane", "Times", "Times", "Times", "the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality", "the American Petroleum Institute", "Methane", "Cornell University", "Scientific Aviation", "DCP Pegasus", "Phillips", "Times", "NORTH", "ODESSA", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE PER HOUR", "Targa", "DCP Pegasus", "POUNDS METHANE", "Targa Midkiff Plant", "POUNDS METHANE", "NORTH", "ODESSA", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "DCP Pegasus", "Targa", "POUNDS METHANE", "Targa Midkiff Plant", "POUNDS METHANE", "ODESSA", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "POUNDS METHANE", "DCP Pegasus", "Targa", "POUNDS METHANE", "Targa Midkiff Plant", "POUNDS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "Targa Midkiff Plant", "LBS METHANE", "Targa", "Driver Plant", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "DCP Pegasus", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "Targa Midkiff Plant", "LBS METHANE", "Targa", "Driver Plant", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "LBS METHANE", "DCP Pegasus", "Copernicus Sentinel-2", "DCP Pegasus", "DCP", "DCP", "Phillips", "EagleClaw", "EagleClaw", "DCP", "the Environmental Protection Agency", "GPA Midstream", "Times", "GPA Midstream", "GPA", "the Independent Petroleum Association of America", "BP", "Exxon Mobil", "Chevron", "Shell", "the American Petroleum Institute", "the Independent Petroleum Association of America", "BP", "Exxon", "Chevron", "Shell", "BP", "Shell", "MDC Texas Operator", "the Climate Fwd", "Times"], "PERSON": ["Trump", "Trump", "Trump", "Paolo Wilczak", "Tim Doty", "Howard Feldman", "Trump", "Robert Howarth", "Wilczak", "Wilczak", "Barnett", "Denise Lu", "Doty", "Sarah Sandberg", "Justin Bishop", "Doty", "Todd Carpenter", "Trump", "Trump", "Obama", "Lee O.

Presidential War Powers\nIn recent years, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has claimed that the Constitution authorizes the president, as commander in chief, to order the military to attack other countries without congressional permission if the president determines that this would be anticipatory self-defense or otherwise serve the interests of the United States \u2014 at least where the nature, scope and duration of the anticipated hostilities are \u201climited,\u201d like airstrikes against Libyan government forces in 2011 and Syrian government forces in 2017 and 2018.\nDo you agree with the O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning? Under what circumstances other than a literally imminent threat to the United States, if any, does the Constitution permit a president to order an attack on another country without prior Congressional authorization? What about bombing Iranian or North Korean nuclear facilities?\nweld's Answer\nIt is imperative that the government of the United States be able to respond swiftly and decisively to hostile threats to our safety, security, and other essential interests. This does not require evisceration of our Constitution\u2019s unambiguous assignment of war making powers to Congress.\n\u2022 Do you agree with the O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning?\nIt is imperative that the government of the United States be able to respond swiftly and decisively to hostile threats to our safety, security, and other essential interests. This does not require evisceration of our Constitution\u2019s unambiguous assignment of war making powers to Congress. This power has been inappropriately compromised and eroded over a number of successive Presidential administrations and various Congresses in the hands of each of the major parties. The O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning is simply a recent manifestation. The Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s contra-Constitutional reasoning and its conclusions are incorrect.\nReturning the war making power to Congress will require careful attention to policies and procedures for effective and efficient communication between our diplomatic, military, homeland security, and intelligence officials to appropriately designated members, supported by adequately trained and resourced staff, all with the requisite security clearances. It will be incumbent upon leaders in Congress to develop appropriate rules for making decisions in ways appropriate to the variety of situations that can and do arise.\n\u2022 Under what circumstances other than a literally imminent threat to the United States, if any, does the Constitution permit a president to order an attack on another country without prior Congressional authorization?\nThe President possesses Constitutional authority to protect against specific, imminent, and concrete threats to the United States or risks of death or serious physical injury to United States persons. Even so, it is prudent for the President to seek carefully-circumscribed Congressional authorization related to then-prevailing conditions and circumstances in anticipation of these types of threats.\nThis type of authorization should be subject to periodic Congressional review and require periodic Congressional renewal. It is outrageous that the Trump Administration (like others before it) continues to rely on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force; there will soon be American soldiers and sailors deployed abroad and in harm\u2019s way based on a law passed before they were born.\n\u2022 What about bombing Iranian or North Korean nuclear facilities?\nThe Iranian and North Korean situations are the sort for which the President should seek carefully-circumscribed Congressional authorization to use force as expressly deemed necessary. With appropriate authorization, the President can thereafter properly operate with prudent judgment about whether, how, when to exercise military force as authorized.\nRead full answer\n2. Military Force Against Americans\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, an American citizen who had been arrested in Chicago and accused of terrorism links was deemed to be an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d and transferred to military custody. He was held in wartime detention without trial for years, then transferred back to the civilian justice system before the Supreme Court could resolve his case. In 2011, an American drone strike targeted and killed an American citizen who had been deemed to be an operational terrorist leader whose capture was infeasible, but who had not been charged or convicted in a trial. In 2019, the executive branch was reported to be considering invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces on domestic soil to enforce immigration laws.\nAre any of these examples unlawful? Under what circumstances, if any, may a president use military force within the United States or against Americans?\nweld's Answer\nIt is not generally appropriate to use our national military resources for domestic policing, law enforcement, or other purposes or against United States citizens, certainly when based on contorted legal reasoning used to avoid Congressional authorization. As Professor Louis Hartz observed, the essence of democracy is that the individual should never be backed into the corner.\nIt is not generally appropriate to use our national military resources for domestic policing, law enforcement, or other purposes or against United States citizens, certainly when based on contorted legal reasoning used to avoid Congressional authorization. As Professor Louis Hartz observed, the essence of democracy is that the individual should never be backed into the corner. The use of military force on our soil or against our citizens is an extreme counter-example, so any Congressional authorization for this sort of extra-ordinary activity must be thoroughly informed and highly specific.\nRead full answer\n3. Commander in Chief Power\nAfter 9/11, the NSA wiretapped on domestic soil without court orders seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the CIA used coercive interrogation techniques on prisoners despite antitorture laws and treaties. In the 2014 Bergdahl deal, the military transferred five Guantanamo detainees to Qatar without giving Congress the 30 days notice seemingly required by a detainee transfer law. In each instance, executive branch lawyers said the apparent legal barriers were unconstitutional encroachments on commander in chief power.\nWere any of these actions unlawful? Under what circumstances, if any, do you believe the Constitution empowers the president, as commander in chief, to override or bypass prohibitions or requirements in federal statutes?\nweld's Answer\nOne of the President\u2019s core constitutional responsibilities is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. In each of these three instances, the executive actions were contrary to duly enacted laws within the scope of Congressional authority.\nOne of the President\u2019s core constitutional responsibilities is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. In each of these three instances, the executive actions were contrary to duly enacted laws within the scope of Congressional authority. At the same time, the President does possess certain intrinsic authority as Commander in Chief, so Congress may not dictate, for example, battlefield tactics; but there can be no question that the scope of domestic surveillance and the treatment of detainees are properly within Congress\u2019 law-making prerogative.\nRead full answer\n4. Presidential Signing Statements\nIn recent decades, presidents have started to routinely use \u201csigning statements\u201d to claim a constitutional right to bypass provisions of bills they are signing into law. The American Bar Association has called the practice unconstitutional and said presidents can choose only between vetoing bills, giving Congress an opportunity to override their judgments, or signing and obeying all of them. Other legal specialists have disagreed, saying the practice is appropriate so long as the theories of executive power used to challenge provisions are legitimate.\nUnder what circumstances, if any, would you use signing statements to deem provisions of bills constitutionally invalid?\nweld's Answer\nThe separation of powers assigns to Congress authority to make the laws and to the Courts to declare whether they are constitutionally valid. A President presented with a facially constitutionally problematic bill may properly exercise veto authority; the President is otherwise (i.e, after signing a bill into law or after Congressional override of a veto) bound to take care the law is faithfully executed.\nThe separation of powers assigns to Congress authority to make the laws and to the Courts to declare whether they are constitutionally valid. A President presented with a facially constitutionally problematic bill may properly exercise veto authority; the President is otherwise (i.e, after signing a bill into law or after Congressional override of a veto) bound to take care the law is faithfully executed. That said, under the limited circumstance in which omnibus or other consolidated legislation may contain certain constitutionally infirm provisions, a signing statement is appropriate to indicate Presidential discomfort with engaging in statutorily authorized but constitutionally suspect actions.\nRead full answer\n5. Presidential Obstruction of Justice\nBefore becoming attorney general, William P. Barr took the position that obstruction of justice laws should not be interpreted as applying to a president who abuses his official powers to impede an investigation for corrupt reasons \u2014 and that, as a constitutional matter, Congress could not criminalize abuse of official power even if lawmakers explicitly intended to do so.\nAs a constitutional matter, does Congress have the authority to criminalize a president\u2019s abuse of Article II powers for corrupt purposes? As a statutory matter, do current obstruction-of-justice laws apply to a president\u2019s abuse of his official powers?\nweld's Answer\nYes of course Congress possesses that power. Mr. Barr\u2019s analysis, both in his June 2019 memorandum and subsequently, proves far too much and is legally and constitutionally unsound.\nYes of course Congress possesses that power.

Presidential Indictability\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u2014 first under the Nixon administration during the Watergate scandal, and then under then Clinton administration during the Whitewater/Lewinsky scandal \u2014 has asserted that sitting presidents are immune from criminal indictment and trial and so any such criminal process has to come after they leave office, a view that bound the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\nIs this the correct interpretation of the Constitution? If not, would you instruct your attorney general to rescind those O.L.C. opinions? If so, would you sign legislation tolling the statute of limitations for any criminal offenses by presidents so that it does not run while they are in office?\nweld's Answer\nIn my view it would be constitutional for the Justice Department to file a sealed indictment against a sitting president, so as to satisfy the statute of limitations, as long as the sitting president was not obliged to respond to the charges or to compulsory process while in office.\nIn my view it would be constitutional for the Justice Department to file a sealed indictment against a sitting president, so as to satisfy the statute of limitations, as long as the sitting president was not obliged to respond to the charges or to compulsory process while in office.\nRead full answer\n7. Executive Secrecy\nPresidents of both parties have claimed that executive privilege applies not only to their own internal White House communications, but also to internal deliberations within government department and agencies that do not involve the president. The Trump legal team has further argued that congressional subpoenas whose primary goal is to uncover potential wrongdoing, rather than to inform bill writing, are invalid because they lack a legitimate legislative purpose.\nDoes executive privilege extend to agency deliberations that did not involve the White House? Does Congress have legitimate constitutional authority to issue subpoenas compelling disclosure of information about potential wrongdoing?\nweld's Answer\nI think an otherwise proper assertion of executive privilege could extend to executive branch deliberations not involving the White House. On the other hand, the oversight responsibilities of Congress clearly warrant the issuance of subpoenas seeking evidence of potential wrongdoing.\nI think an otherwise proper assertion of executive privilege could extend to executive branch deliberations not involving the White House.

Press Freedoms\nProsecutors recently expanded a criminal case against Julian Assange to include accusations that he violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and publishing classified documents leaked in 2010 by Chelsea Manning, which could establish a precedent that such common journalistic activities (a separate question from whether Assange counts as a \u201cjournalist\u201d) can be treated as a crime in America.\nAre these charges constitutional?

Tell me whatever you need and I will provide it for you.\nThe Iran Cables: Secret Documents Show How Tehran Wields Power in Iraq\nHundreds of leaked intelligence reports shed light on a shadow war for regional influence \u2014 and the battles within the Islamic Republic\u2019s own spy divisions\nIn mid-October, with unrest swirling in Baghdad, a familiar visitor slipped quietly into the Iraqi capital. The city had been under siege for weeks, as protesters marched in the streets, demanding an end to corruption and calling for the ouster of the prime minister, Adil Abdul Mahdi. In particular, they denounced the outsize influence of their neighbor Iran in Iraqi politics, burning Iranian flags and attacking an Iranian consulate.\nThe visitor was there to restore order, but his presence highlighted the protesters\u2019 biggest grievance: he was Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, head of Iran\u2019s powerful Quds Force, and he had come to persuade an ally in the Iraqi Parliament to help the prime minister hold onto his job.\nIt was not the first time General Suleimani had been dispatched to Baghdad to do damage control. Tehran\u2019s efforts to prop up Mr. Mahdi are part of its long campaign to maintain Iraq as a pliable client state.\nNow leaked Iranian documents offer a detailed portrait of just how aggressively Tehran has worked to embed itself into Iraqi affairs, and of the unique role of General Suleimani. The documents are contained in an archive of secret Iranian intelligence cables obtained by The Intercept and shared with The New York Times for this article, which is being published simultaneously by both news organizations.\nThe unprecedented leak exposes Tehran\u2019s vast influence in Iraq, detailing years of painstaking work by Iranian spies to co-opt the country\u2019s leaders, pay Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides and infiltrate every aspect of Iraq\u2019s political, economic and religious life.\nMany of the cables describe real-life espionage capers that feel torn from the pages of a spy thriller. Meetings are arranged in dark alleyways and shopping malls or under the cover of a hunting excursion or a birthday party. Informants lurk at the Baghdad airport, snapping pictures of American soldiers and keeping tabs on coalition military flights. Agents drive meandering routes to meetings to evade surveillance. Sources are plied with gifts of pistachios, cologne and saffron. Iraqi officials, if necessary, are offered bribes. The archive even contains expense reports from intelligence ministry officers in Iraq, including one totaling 87.5 euros spent on gifts for a Kurdish commander.\nAbout the Iran Cables\nThis article was reported in partnership with The Intercept, a nonprofit investigative news organization.\n[Read the key findings from this investigation.]\nAccording to one of the leaked Iranian intelligence cables, Mr. Mahdi, who in exile worked closely with Iran while Saddam Hussein was in power in Iraq, had a \u201cspecial relationship with the I.R.I.\u201d \u2014 the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 when he was Iraq\u2019s oil minister in 2014. The exact nature of that relationship is not detailed in the cable, and, as one former senior U.S. official cautioned, a \u201cspecial relationship could mean a lot of things \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean he is an agent of the Iranian government.\u201d But no Iraqi politician can become prime minister without Iran\u2019s blessing, and Mr. Mahdi, when he secured the premiership in 2018, was seen as a compromise candidate acceptable to both Iran and the United States.\nThe leaked cables offer an extraordinary glimpse inside the secretive Iranian regime. They also detail the extent to which Iraq has fallen under Iranian influence since the American invasion in 2003, which transformed Iraq into a gateway for Iranian power, connecting the Islamic Republic\u2019s geography of dominance from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe trove of leaked Iranian intelligence reports largely confirms what was already known about Iran\u2019s firm grip on Iraqi politics. But the reports reveal far more than was previously understood about the extent to which Iran and the United States have used Iraq as a staging area for their spy games. They also shed new light on the complex internal politics of the Iranian government, where competing factions are grappling with many of the same challenges faced by American occupying forces as they struggled to stabilize Iraq after the United States invasion.\nAnd the documents show how Iran, at nearly every turn, has outmaneuvered the United States in the contest for influence.\nThe archive is made up of hundreds of reports and cables written mainly in 2014 and 2015 by officers of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, or M.O.I.S., who were serving in the field in Iraq. The intelligence ministry, Iran\u2019s version of the C.I.A., has a reputation as an analytical and professional agency, but it is overshadowed and often overruled by its more ideological counterpart, the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was formally established as an independent entity in 2009 at the order of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nIn Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, which Iran considers crucial to its national security, the Revolutionary Guards \u2014 and in particular its elite Quds Force, led by General Suleimani \u2014 determines Iran\u2019s policies. Ambassadors to those countries are appointed from the senior ranks of the Revolutionary Guards, not the foreign ministry, which oversees the intelligence ministry, according to several advisers to current and past Iranian administrations. Officers from the intelligence ministry and from the Revolutionary Guards in Iraq worked parallel to one another, said these sources. They reported their findings back to their respective headquarters in Tehran, which in turn organized them into reports for the Supreme Council of National Security.\nCultivating Iraqi officials was a key part of their job, and it was made easier by the alliances many Iraqi leaders forged with Iran when they belonged to opposition groups fighting Saddam Hussein. Many of Iraq\u2019s foremost political, military, and security officials have had secret relationships with Tehran, according to the documents. The same 2014 cable that described Mr. Mahdi\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d also named several other key members of the cabinet of former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi as having close ties with Iran.\n\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0637 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0648 \u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634 \u0648 \u0647\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u060c \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u0648 \u06cc\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u060c \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f.\nThe current objective is for this person to provide intelligence insights into the U.S. government\u2019s plans in Iraq, whether it is for dealing with ISIS or any other covert operations. The ultimate goal is for this person to be an informant, either in the U.S. State Department or with any Iraqi Sunni or Kurdish leaders who are willing to cooperate.\nA political analyst and adviser on Iraq to Iran\u2019s government, Gheis Ghoreishi, confirmed that Iran has focused on cultivating high-level officials in Iraq. \u201cWe have a good number of allies among Iraqi leaders who we can trust with our eyes closed,\u201d he said.\nThree Iranian officials were asked to comment for this article, in queries that described the existence of the leaked cables and reports. Alireza Miryusefi, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s United Nations mission, said he was away until later this month. Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran\u2019s United Nations ambassador, did not respond to a written request that was hand-delivered to his official residence. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif did not respond to an emailed request.\nWhen reached by telephone, Hassan Danaiefar, Iran\u2019s ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2017 and a former deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 naval forces, declined to directly address the existence of the cables or their release, but he did suggest that Iran had the upper hand in information gathering in Iraq. \u201cYes, we have a lot of information from Iraq on multiple issues, especially about what America was doing there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a wide gap between the reality and perception of U.S. actions in Iraq. I have many stories to tell.\u201d He declined to elaborate.\nAccording to the reports, after the American troop withdrawal in 2011, Iran moved quickly to add former C.I.A. informants to its payroll. One undated section of an intelligence ministry cable shows that Iran began the process of recruiting a spy inside the State Department. It is unclear what came of the recruitment effort, but according to the files, Iran had started meeting with the source, and offered to reward the potential asset with a salary, gold coins and other gifts. The State Department official is not named in the cable, but the person is described as someone who would be able to provide \u201cintelligence insights into the U.S. government\u2019s plans in Iraq, whether it is for dealing with ISIS or any other covert operations.\u201d\n\u201cThe subject\u2019s incentive in collaborating will be financial,\u201d the report said.\nThe State Department declined to comment on the matter.\nIn interviews, Iranian officials acknowledged that Iran viewed surveillance of American activity in Iraq after the United States invasion as critical to its survival and national security. When American forces toppled Saddam Hussein, Iran swiftly moved some of its best officers from both the intelligence ministry and from the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards to Iraq, according to the Iranian government advisers and a person affiliated with the Guards. President George W. Bush had declared Iran to be part of an \u201caxis of evil,\u201d and Iranian leaders believed Tehran would be next on Washington\u2019s list of regime-change capitals after Kabul and Baghdad.\n700 pages of documents\nAround the world, governments have had to contend with the occasional leak of secret communiqu\u00e9s or personal emails as a fact of modern life. Not so in Iran, where information is tightly controlled and the security services are widely feared.\nThe roughly 700 pages of leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from Persian to English and shared them with The Times. The Intercept and The Times verified the authenticity of the documents but do not know who leaked them. The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to \u201clet the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.\u201d\nLike the internal communications of any spy service, some of the reports contain raw intelligence whose accuracy is questionable, while others appear to represent the views of intelligence officers and sources with their own agendas.\nSome of the cables show bumbling and comical ineptitude, like one that describes the Iranian spies who broke into a German cultural institute in Iraq only to find they had the wrong codes and could not unlock the safes. Other officers were browbeaten by their superiors in Tehran for laziness, and for sending back to headquarters reports that relied only on news accounts.\nBut by and large, the intelligence ministry operatives portrayed in the documents appear patient, professional and pragmatic. Their main tasks are to keep Iraq from falling apart; from breeding Sunni militants on the Iranian border; from descending into sectarian warfare that might make Shia Muslims the targets of violence; and from spinning off an independent Kurdistan that would threaten regional stability and Iranian territorial integrity. The Revolutionary Guards and General Suleimani have also worked to eradicate the Islamic State, but with a greater focus on maintaining Iraq as a client state of Iran and making sure that political factions loyal to Tehran remain in power.\nThis portrait is all the more striking at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. Since 2018, when President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions, the White House has rushed ships to the Persian Gulf and reviewed military plans for war with Iran. In October, the Trump administration promised to send American troops to Saudi Arabia following attacks on oil facilities there for which Iran was widely blamed.\n\u2018Tell them we are at your service.\u2019\nWith a shared faith and tribal affiliations that span a porous border, Iran has long been a major presence in Southern Iraq. It has opened religious offices in Iraq\u2019s holy cities and posted banners of Iran\u2019s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on its streets. It supports some of the most powerful political parties in the south, dispatches Iranian students to study in Iraqi seminaries and sends Iranian construction workers to build Iraqi hotels and refurbish Iraqi shrines.\nBut while Iran may have bested the United States in the contest for influence in Baghdad, it has struggled to win popular support in the Iraqi south. Now, as the last six weeks of protests make clear, it is facing unexpectedly strong pushback. Across the south, Iranian-backed Iraqi political parties are seeing their headquarters burned and their leading operatives assassinated, an indication that Iran may have underestimated the Iraqi desire for independence not just from the United States but also from its neighbor.\nIn a sense, the leaked Iranian cables provide a final accounting of the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq. The notion that the Americans handed control of Iraq to Iran when they invaded now enjoys broad support, even within the United States military. A recent two-volume history of the Iraq War, published by the United States Army, details the campaign\u2019s many missteps and its \u201cstaggering cost\u201d in lives and money. Nearly 4,500 American troops were killed, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died and American taxpayers spent up to $2 trillion on the war. The study, which totals hundreds of pages and draws on declassified documents, concludes: \u201cAn emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor.\u201d\nTurkey\nTigris\nSyria\nIraq\nIran\nAkkaz\ngas field\nBaghdad\nFalluja\nJurf Al-Sakhar\nKarbala\nNajaf\nEuphrates\nSaudi Arabia\nKuwait\n100 miles\nBy The New York Times\nIran\u2019s rise as a power player in Iraq was in many ways a direct consequence of Washington\u2019s lack of any post-invasion plan. The early years following the fall of Saddam were chaotic, both in terms of security and in the lack of basic services like water and electricity. To most observers on the ground, it appeared as if the United States was shaping policy on the go, and in the dark.\nAmong the most disastrous American policies were the decisions to dismantle Iraq\u2019s armed forces and to purge from government service or the new armed forces any Iraqi who had been a member of Saddam\u2019s ruling Baath Party. This process, known as de-Baathification, automatically marginalized most Sunni men. Unemployed and resentful, they formed a violent insurgency targeting Americans and Shias seen as United States allies.\nAs sectarian warfare between Sunnis and Shias raged, the Shia population looked to Iran as a protector. When ISIS gained control of territory and cities, the Shias\u2019 vulnerability and the failure of the United States to protect them fueled efforts by the Revolutionary Guards and General Suleimani to recruit and mobilize Shia militias loyal to Iran.\nAccording to the intelligence ministry documents, Iran has continued to take advantage of the opportunities the United States has afforded it in Iraq. Iran, for example, reaped an intelligence windfall of American secrets as the United States presence began to recede after its 2011 troop withdrawal. The C.I.A. had tossed many of its longtime secret agents out on the street, leaving them jobless and destitute in a country still shattered from the invasion \u2014 and fearful that they could be killed for their links with the United States, possibly by Iran. Short of money, many began to offer their services to Tehran. And they were happy to tell the Iranians everything they knew about C.I.A. operations in Iraq.\nIn November 2014, one of them, an Iraqi who had spied for the C.I.A., broke and terrified that his ties to the Americans would cost him his life, switched sides. The C.I.A., according to the cable, had known the man by a nickname: \u201cDonnie Brasco.\u201d His Iranian handler would call him, simply \u201cSource 134992.\u201d\nTurning to Iran for protection, he said that everything he knew about American intelligence gathering in Iraq was for sale: the locations of C.I.A. safe houses; the names of hotels where C.I.A. operatives met with agents; details of his weapons and surveillance training; the names of other Iraqis working as spies for the Americans.\nSource 134992 told the Iranian operatives he had worked for the agency for 18 months starting in 2008, on a program targeting Al Qaeda. He said he had been paid well for his work \u2014 $3,000 per month, plus a one-time bonus of $20,000 and a car.\nBut swearing on the Quran, he promised that his days of spying for the United States were over, and agreed to write a full report for the Iranians on everything he knew from his time with the C.I.A.\n\u201cI will turn over to you all the documents and videos that I have from my training course,\u201d the Iraqi man told his Iranian handler, according to a 2014 Iranian intelligence report. \u201cAnd pictures and identifying features of my fellow trainees and my subordinates.\u201d\nThe C.I.A. declined to comment.\nIranian spies, Iraqi officials say, are everywhere in the south, and the region has long been a beehive of espionage. It was there, in Karbala in late 2014, that an Iraqi military intelligence officer, down from Baghdad, met with an Iranian intelligence official and offered to spy for Iran \u2014 and to tell the Iranians whatever he could about American activities in Iraq.\n\u201cIran is my second country and I love it,\u201d the Iraqi official told the Iranian officer, according to one of the cables. In a meeting that lasted more than three hours, the Iraqi told of his devotion to the Iranian system of government, in which clerics rule directly, and his admiration for Iranian movies.\nHe said he had come with a message from his boss in Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Hatem al-Maksusi, then commander of military intelligence in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense: \u201cTell them we are at your service. Whatever you need is at their disposal. We are Shiite and have a common enemy.\u201d\nGeneral al-Maksusi\u2019s messenger continued, \u201cAll of the Iraqi Army\u2019s intelligence \u2014 consider it yours.\u201d He told the Iranian intelligence officer about secret targeting software the United States had provided to the Iraqis, and offered to turn it over to the Iranians. \u201cIf you have a new laptop, give it to me so I can upload the program onto it,\u201d he said.\nAnd there was more, he said. The United States had also given Iraq a highly sensitive system for eavesdropping on mobile phones, which was run out of the prime minister\u2019s office and the headquarters of Iraqi military intelligence. \u201cI will put at your disposal whatever intelligence about it you want,\u201d he said.\nIn an interview, General al-Maksusi, disputed saying the things attributed to him in the cables and denied ever working for Iran. He praised Iran for its help in the fight against the Islamic State, but said he had also maintained a close relationship with the United States. \u201cI worked for Iraq and did not work for any other state,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not the intelligence director for the Shiites, but I was intelligence director for all of Iraq.\u201d\nWhen asked about the cable, a former American official said the United States had become aware of the Iraqi military intelligence officer\u2019s ties to Iran and had limited his access to sensitive information.\n\u2018The Americans\u2019 candidate\u2019\nBy late 2014, the United States was once again pouring weapons and soldiers into Iraq as it began battling the Islamic State. Iran, too, had an interest in defeating the militants. As ISIS took control of the west and the north, young Iraqi men traveled across the deserts and marshes of the south by the busload, heading to Iran for military training.\nSome within the American and Iranian governments believed the two rivals should coordinate their efforts against a common enemy. But Iran, as the leaked cables make clear, also viewed the increased American presence as a threat and a \u201ccover\u201d to gather intelligence about Iran.\n\u201cWhat is happening in the sky over Iraq shows the massive level of activity of the coalition,\u201d one Iranian officer wrote. \u201cThe danger for the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s interests represented by their activity must be taken seriously.\u201d\nThe rise of ISIS was at the same time driving a wedge between the Obama administration and a large swath of the Iraqi political class. Mr. Obama had pushed for the ouster of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki as a condition for renewed American military support. He believed Mr. al-Maliki\u2019s draconian policies and crackdowns on Iraqi Sunnis had helped lead to the rise of the militants.\nMr. al-Maliki, who had lived in exile in Iran in the 1980s, was a favorite of Tehran\u2019s. His replacement, the British-educated Haider al-Abadi, was seen as more friendly to the West and less sectarian. Facing the uncertainty of a new prime minister, Hassan Danaiefar, then Iran\u2019s ambassador, called a secret meeting of senior staffers at the Iranian Embassy, a hulking, fortified structure just outside Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone.\nAs the meeting progressed, it became clear the Iranians had little cause to worry about the new Iraqi government. Mr. Al-Abadi was dismissed as \u201ca British man,\u201d and \u201cthe Americans\u2019 candidate,\u201d but the Iranians believed they had plenty of other ministers in their pocket.\nOne by one, Mr. Danaiefar went down the list of cabinet members, describing their relationships to Iran.\nIbrahim al-Jafari \u2014 who had previously served as Iraqi prime minister and by late 2014 was the foreign minister \u2014 was, like Mr. Mahdi, identified as having a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Iran. In an interview, Mr. al-Jafari did not deny that he had close relations with Iran, but said he had always dealt with foreign countries based on the interests of Iraq.\nIran counted on the loyalty of many lesser cabinet members as well.\nThe report said the ministers of municipalities, communications and human rights \u201care in complete harmony and at one with us and are our people.\u201d The environment minister, it said, \u201cworks with us, although he is Sunni.\u201d The transportation minister \u2014 Bayan Jabr, who had led the Iraqi Interior Ministry at a time when hundreds of prisoners were tortured to death with electric drills or summarily shot by Shiite death squads \u2014 was deemed to be \u201cvery close\u201d to Iran. When it came to Iraq\u2019s education minister, the report says, \u201cwe will have no problem with him.\u201d\nThe former ministers of municipalities, communications and human rights were all members of the Badr Organization, a political and military group established by Iran in the 1980s to oppose Saddam Hussein. The former minister of municipalities denied having a close relationship with Iran; the former human rights minister acknowledged being close to Iran, and praised Iran for helping Shiite Iraqis during Mr. Hussein\u2019s dictatorship, and for help defeating the Islamic State. The former minister of communications said that he served Iraq, not Iran, and that he maintained relationships with diplomats from many countries; the former minister of education said that he had not been supported by Iran, and that he served at the request of Prime Minister al-Abadi. The former environment minister could not be reached for comment.\nIran\u2019s dominance over Iraqi politics is vividly shown in one important episode from the fall of 2014, when Baghdad was a city at the center of a multinational maelstrom. The Syrian civil war was raging to the west, Islamic State militants had seized almost a third of Iraq and American troops were heading back to the region to confront the growing crisis.\nAgainst this chaotic backdrop, Mr. Jabr, then the transportation minister, welcomed General Suleimani, the Quds Force commander, to his office. General Suleimani had come to ask a favor: Iran needed access to Iraqi airspace to fly planeloads of weapons and other supplies to support the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad in its fight against American-backed rebels.\nIt was a request that placed Mr. Jabr at the center of the longstanding rivalry between the United States and Iran. Obama administration officials had been lobbying hard to get the Iraqis to stop Iranian flights through their airspace, but face to face with the Quds chief, Iraq\u2019s transportation minister found it impossible to refuse.\nGeneral Suleimani, Mr. Jabr recalled, \u201ccame to me and requested that we permit Iranian airplanes to use Iraqi air space to pass on to Syria,\u201d according to one of the cables. The transportation minister did not hesitate, and General Suleimani appeared to be pleased. \u201cI put my hands on my eyes and said, \u2018On my eyes! As you wish!\u2019\u201d Mr. Jabr told the intelligence ministry officer. \u201cThen he got up and approached me and kissed my forehead.\u201d\nMr. Jabr confirmed the meeting with General Suleimani, but said the flights from Iran to Syria carried humanitarian supplies and religious pilgrims traveling to Syria to visit holy sites, not weapons and military supplies to aid Mr. Assad as American officials believed.\nMeanwhile, Iraqi officials known to have a relationship with the United States came under special scrutiny, and Iran took measures to counter American influence. Indeed, many of the files show that as top American diplomats met behind closed doors with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad, their conversations were routinely reported back to the Iranians.\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, as a new Iraqi government settled in, the American ambassador, Stuart Jones, met often with Salim al-Jabouri, who was speaker of the Iraqi Parliament until last year. Mr. al-Jabouri, although he is Sunni, was known to have a close relationship with Iran, but the files now reveal that one of his top political advisers \u2014 identified as Source 134832 \u2014 was an Iranian intelligence asset. \u201c[I] am present in his office on a daily basis and carefully follow his contacts with the Americans,\u201d the source told his Iranian handler. Mr. al-Jabouri, in an interview, said he did not believe that anyone on his staff had worked as an agent for Iran, and that he fully trusted his aides. (Mr. Jones declined to comment.)\nThe source urged the Iranians to develop closer ties to Mr. al-Jabouri, to blunt American efforts to nurture a new class of younger Sunni leaders in Iraq and perhaps bring about reconciliation between Sunnis and Shias. The source warned that Iran should act to keep the Parliament speaker from \u201cslipping into a pro-American position, since one of Salim al-Jabouri\u2019s characteristics is credulousness and making hasty decisions.\u201d\nAnother report reveals that Nechervan Barzani, then the prime minister of Kurdistan, met with top American and British officials and Mr. al-Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, in Baghdad in December 2014, and then went almost immediately to meet with an Iranian official to tell him everything. Through a spokesman, Mr. Barzani said he did not recall meeting with any Iranian officials at the time, and described the cable as \u201cbaseless and unfounded.\u201d He said he \u201cabsolutely denies\u201d telling the Iranians details about his conversations with American and British diplomats.\nSometimes, the Iranians also saw trade value in the information they received from their Iraqi sources.\nOne report from the al-Jabouri adviser revealed that the United States was interested in gaining access to a rich natural gas field in Akkas, near Iraq\u2019s border with Syria. The source explained that the Americans might eventually try to export the natural gas to Europe, a major market for Russian natural gas. Intrigued, the intelligence ministry officer, in a cable to Tehran, wrote, \u201cIt is recommended that the aforementioned information be used in exchange with the Russians and Syria.\u201d The cable was written just as Russia was significantly stepping up its involvement in Syria, and as Iran continued its military buildup there, in support of President al-Assad.\nAnd although Iran was initially suspicious of Mr. al-Abadi\u2019s allegiances, a report written a few months after his rise to the premiership suggested that he was quite willing to have a confidential relationship with Iranian intelligence. A January 2015 report details a private meeting between al-Abadi and an intelligence ministry officer known as Boroujerdi, held in the prime minister\u2019s office \u201cwithout the presence of a secretary or a third person.\u201d\nDuring the meeting, Boroujerdi homed in on Iraq\u2019s Sunni-Shia divide, probing Mr. al-Abadi\u2019s feelings on perhaps the most sensitive subject in Iraqi politics. \u201cToday, the Sunnis find themselves in the worst possible circumstances and have lost their self-confidence,\u201d the intelligence officer opined, according to the cable. \u201cThe Sunnis are vagrants, their cities are destroyed and an unclear future awaits them, while the Shias can retrieve their self-confidence.\u201d\nIraq\u2019s Shia were \u201cat a historical turning point,\u201d Boroujerdi continued. The Iraqi government and Iran could \u201ctake advantage of this situation.\u201d\nAccording to the cable, the prime minister expressed his \u201ccomplete agreement.\u201d Mr. Abadi declined to comment.\n\u2018Sweetness into bitterness\u2019\nEver since the start of the Iraq War in 2003, Iran has put itself forward as the protector of Iraq\u2019s Shiites, and General Suleimani, more than anyone else, has employed the dark arts of espionage and covert military action to ensure that Shiite power remains ascendant. But it has come at the cost of stability, with Sunnis perennially disenfranchised and looking to other groups, like the Islamic State, to protect them.\nA 2014 massacre of Sunnis in the farming community of Jurf al-Sakhar was a vivid example of the kinds of sectarian atrocities committed by armed groups loyal to Iran\u2019s Quds Force that had alarmed the United States throughout the Iraq War, and undermined efforts at reconciliation. As the field reports make clear, some of the Americans\u2019 concerns were shared by the Iranian intelligence ministry. That signaled divisions within Iran over its Iraq policies between more moderate elements under President Hassan Rouhani and militant factions like the Revolutionary Guards.\n\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u062c\u0631\u0641 \u0635\u062e\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0648 \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0627\u0632\u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u06a9\u0648\u0686\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0646\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u062e\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0642\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0646\u062f \u06af\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u062e\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u062e\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0636\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u067e\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0633\u0631 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u062f\u062f. \u0627\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0647 (\u06af\u0627\u0648 \u06af\u0648\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062f) \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0642\u0627\u0637 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u067e\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0645\u0634\u063a\u0648\u0644 \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f.\nThe area around Jurf Al-Sakhar has been cleansed of terrorist agents. Their families have been driven away, most of their houses have been destroyed by military forces and the rest will be destroyed. In some places, the palm orchards have been uprooted to be burned to prevent the terrorists from taking shelter among the trees.\nThe people\u2019s livestock (cows and sheep) have been scattered and are grazing without their owners.\nJurf al-Sakhar, which lies just east of Falluja in the Euphrates River Valley, is lush with orange trees and palm groves. It was overrun by the Islamic State in 2014, giving militants a foothold from which they could launch attacks on the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.\nJurf al-Sakhar is also important to Iran because it lies on a route Shiite religious pilgrims use to travel to Karbala during Muharram, the monthlong commemoration of the death of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Imam Hussein, a revered figure for Shiites.\nWhen Shiite militias supported by Iran drove the militants out of Jurf al-Sakhar in late 2014, the first major victory over the Islamic State, it became a ghost town. It was no longer a threat to the thousands of Shiite pilgrims who would pass by, but Iran\u2019s victory came at a high cost to the town\u2019s Sunni residents. Tens of thousands were displaced, and a local politician, the only Sunni member on the provincial council, was found with a bullet hole through his head.\nOne cable describes the damage in almost biblical terms. \u201cAs a result of these operations,\u201d its author reported, \u201cthe area around Jurf al-Sakhar has been cleansed of terrorist agents. Their families have been driven away, most of their houses have been destroyed by military forces and the rest will be destroyed. In some places, the palm orchards have been uprooted to be burned to prevent the terrorists from taking shelter among the trees. The people\u2019s livestock (cows and sheep) have been scattered and are grazing without their owners.\u201d\nThe Jurf al-Sakhar operation and other bloody actions led by Iran\u2019s proxies and directed by Tehran further alienated Iraq\u2019s Sunni population, according to one report, which notes that \u201cdestroying villages and houses, looting the Sunnis\u2019 property and livestock turned the sweetness of these successes\u201d against the Islamic State into \u201cbitterness.\u201d One of the Jurf al-Sakhar cables cast the impact of Shiite militias in particularly stark terms: \u201cIn all the areas where the Popular Mobilization Forces go into action, the Sunnis flee, abandoning their homes and property, and prefer to live in tents as refugees or reside in camps.\u201d\nThe intelligence ministry feared that Iran\u2019s gains in Iraq were being squandered because Iraqis so resented the Shia militias and the Quds Force that sponsored them. Above all, its officers blamed General Suleimani, whom they saw as a dangerous self-promoter using the anti-ISIS campaign as a launching pad for a political career back home in Iran. One report, which states at the top that it is not to be shared with the Quds Force, criticizes the general personally for publicizing his leading role in the military campaign in Iraq by \u201cpublishing pictures of himself on different social media sites.\u201d\nDoing that had made it obvious that Iran controlled the dreaded Shia militias \u2014 a potential gift to its rivals. \u201cThis policy of Iran in Iraq,\u201d the report said, \u201chas allowed the Americans to return to Iraq with greater legitimacy. And groups and individuals who had been fighting against the Americans among the Sunnis are now wishing that not only America, but even Israel, would enter Iraq and save Iraq from Iran\u2019s clutches.\u201d\nAt times, the Iranians sought to counter the ill will generated by their presence in Iraq with soft-power campaigns similar to American battlefield efforts to win \u201chearts and minds.\u201d Hoping to gain a \u201cpropaganda advantage and restore Iran\u2019s image among the people,\u201d Iran devised a plan to send pediatricians and gynecologists to villages in northern Iraq to administer health services, according to one field report.

Currently, any actions taken against Sunnis will be blamed on Iran, whether Iran had a direct or indirect role in it, or none at all.\nJust as often, Iran would use its influence to close lucrative development deals. With Iraq dependent on Iran for military support in the fight against the Islamic State, one cable shows the Quds Force receiving oil and development contracts from Iraq\u2019s Kurds in exchange for weapons and other aid. In the south, Iran was awarded contracts for sewage and water purification by paying a $16 million bribe to a member of Parliament, according to another field report.\nToday, Iran is struggling to maintain its hegemony in Iraq, just as the Americans did after the 2003 invasion. Iraqi officials, meanwhile, are increasingly worried that a provocation in Iraq on either side could set off a war between the two powerful countries vying for dominance in their homeland. Against this geopolitical backdrop, Iraqis learned long ago to take a pragmatic approach to the overtures of Iran\u2019s spies \u2014 even Sunni Iraqis who view Iran as an enemy.\n\u201cNot only doesn\u2019t he believe in Iran, but he doesn\u2019t believe that Iran might have positive intentions toward Iraq,\u201d one Iranian case officer wrote in late 2014, about an Iraqi intelligence recruit described as a Baathist who had once worked for Saddam Hussein and later the C.I.A. \u201cBut he is a professional spy and understands the reality of Iran and the Shia in Iraq and will collaborate to save himself.\u201d\nThis story was reported in partnership with The Intercept, where James Risen is the senior national security correspondent and Murtaza Hussain is a reporter.\nAdditional Reporting: Matthew Cole and Laura Secor for The Intercept; Rick Gladstone, Falih Hassan and Alissa J.

This week, Times Opinion is reporting on a huge trove of location data showing the precise location movements for millions of Americans.\nOnce your location is shared with the companies, there\u2019s no way to delete that information or get it back. Your best bet is to avoid sharing your location in the first place \u2014 at least until the government bestirs itself to begin regulating how that information is collected, used and sold.\n1\nStop sharing your location with apps\nThe most important thing you can do now is to disable location sharing for apps already on your phone. (Don\u2019t worry, your phone will automatically send its location to emergency responders if you dial 911.) It\u2019s easy to do this without having to open each app.\nSelect your device\nWe used a Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 9 for these instructions; the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your device.\nTo turn off location sharing, go to Settings Privacy Location Services. You can choose when to share your location for each app.\nTo turn off location sharing, go to Settings Biometrics and security App permissions Location. You can choose whether to share your location for each app.\nYou can also prevent your phone from sharing your location in the background. To do so, go to Settings General Background App Refresh. This will not affect your ability to receive push notifications.\nMany apps that request your location, like weather, coupon or local news apps, often work just fine without it. There\u2019s no reason a weather app, for instance, needs your precise, second-by-second location to provide forecasts for your city.\nApple has recently made it harder for companies to snoop on your whereabouts via backdoor methods like checking for nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks. Make sure your phone\u2019s operating system is updated to benefit from these safeguards.\n2\nDisable your mobile ad ID\nYour online activity is often tied together and tracked using your mobile advertising ID, which is a unique number created by your phone and sent to advertisers and app makers.\nSince location data is sent along with your ad ID, it can be tied to other data about you. You can disable this feature entirely in your privacy settings, limiting the ways companies can tie your activities together.\nGo to Settings Privacy Advertising and turn on Limit Ad Tracking.\nGo to Settings Google Ads and then turn on Opt out of Ads Personalization.\n3\nPrevent Google from storing your location\nIf you have a Google account, the company may already have saved a trove of location data tied to your devices. You can prevent Google from collecting this information by going to your account\u2019s location activity controls and turning off location sharing.\n4\nUnderstand location tracking is hard to avoid\nYou can do only so much. Location vendors are engaged in a race to find new ways to ferret out your devices, regardless of whether you followed the steps above. Some will try to identify you using your device type, I.P. address, screen size and even volume and screen brightness, in a process called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d\nYour mobile carrier also collects location pings while your phone is turned on, regardless of whether you followed the steps above. Telecom companies were recently caught selling that data to companies that then resold it to bounty hunters, who used it to find phones in real time. The telecom companies have since pledged to stop selling the data, but they still collect it.\nInterested in doing more to keep your location to yourself?

What is happening here is happening across the country. Nationally, high school participation in 11-man football has fallen more than 10 percent since 2009.\nIt is falling all over the country: on the coasts and in the heartland, in the Upper Midwest and in the Deep South, and in California, Florida and Texas.\nFootball has long been a fundamental part of the American identity, and it likely will be for years to come. But it has become mired in controversy over safety, and it has to compete harder each year with the popularity of other sports. In Maiden and elsewhere, the joyous Friday nights and Saturday afternoons remain, but they are different now.\nOn a December morning in 2017, some of the most powerful men in football gathered at a Midtown hotel in New York with a vital mission: to save their sport.\nRobert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, was there, as was the commissioner of the N.F.L., Roger Goodell. Commissioners from the Power 5 college athletic conferences were in the room. So were Northwestern\u2019s head coach, Pat Fitzgerald, and a pair of Hall of Famers turned business titans, Roger Staubach and Archie Manning.\nThat these men felt compelled to turn the gathering, an annual meeting of the National Football Foundation, into a strategy session for pushing back against the forces threatening their game illustrates the dramatic disruption football has undergone in the past decade. Over that time, the public\u2019s awareness of football\u2019s role in some forms of long-term brain damage has potentially become the sport\u2019s kryptonite.\nThere was no table-pounding, no hand-wringing. But there was a sense of urgency.\n\u201cIf we stand for anything, it\u2019s to protect the game, so let\u2019s step off the curb and get to work,\u201d said Steve Hatchell, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, summing up the mood in the room that day.\nFootball is still the most popular high school sport among boys.\nFootball remains far and away the country\u2019s most popular sport. It garners huge television audiences every week, and more children play it than any other sport. But participation in youth leagues is dropping. Over the last decade, the number of high school boys playing tackle football \u2014 the heart and soul of the sport \u2014 has dropped more than 10 percent. The people who play the game are changing, too, with the number of white players diminishing as black and Hispanic players increasingly make up a larger plurality of the player pool.\nWhite high school boys make up a smaller share of football players.\nHarder to measure is how fans perceive the game, but clearly football has become yet another thing that people are for or against. Several states are considering whether young people should even play the tackle version of the sport at all, as they weigh legislation to impose minimum age requirements for playing.\nAs research on the damage football causes to young athletes grows and stories about the diminished capabilities of former N.F.L. greats continue to be a vital part of the sports conversation, some parents have come to fear that they may be putting their children in danger by letting them play football.\nThose forces make securing the future of the sport a substantial challenge. Football participation is down even in unexpected places, while soccer and cross-country running have grown significantly.\nFootball participation is down in states that typically feed the N.F.L.\nIn Texas, the state that gave us $70 million high school stadiums and \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d football participation is down 10 percent. Ohio has produced the fourth highest total of N.F.L. players, but participation has dropped 27 percent in the Buckeye State. Eight Ohio high schools were unable to fill squads to play even eight-man football last year.\nKansas, stricken with budget cuts, has seen participation fall 13 percent. With that decline, expensive football programs have become an easy target for school boards looking to save money. The state now has 12 schools playing six-man football.\nIt\u2019s impossible to nail down one reason for the decline. Specialization has hurt all sports, as has the growth of video games and e-sports.\nIt is also impossible, however, to ignore the impact of health and safety, especially when it comes to brain injuries.\nNot only are high school boys almost twice as likely to sustain a head injury in football during a game compared with the next closest sport, but they also are more likely to get a head injury in football than any other injury in any other sport recorded in the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study.\nThis is how Caine Houser, the athletic director at Maiden High School in North Carolina, in the heart of a breeding ground for many top college programs, summed up the psyche that his staff has to battle: \u201cParents are scared of head injuries, and rightly so.\u201d\nHere are the most common injuries for boys\u2019 basketball.\nIn boys\u2019 soccer, 11 head injuries take place every 10,000 competition plays.\nBoys\u2019 hockey has the second highest rate of head injuries.\nBoys\u2019 football has the highest rate of head injuries, nearly double that of hockey.\nCommon injuries for boys among popular high school sports\nInjuries per 10,000 competition plays\nThe New York Times commissioned a national online poll of 1,000 14- to 17-year-old boys. The survey, conducted by Pollfish and PredictWise this fall, found 9 percent of those who identified themselves as football players said they had parents who voiced concerns over head injuries, compared with 3 percent of wrestlers and 2 percent of hockey players. Still, only 4 percent of boys who had quit football said that personal concerns over head injuries were the main reason they quit. A third of former players said they just lost interest, another third became busy with something else and 15 percent said they simply started playing another sport.\nHouser said the number of players on the Maiden varsity football team had fallen to 30 from 39 since 2008. The decline, he said, is worse in neighboring districts where junior varsity teams have been shuttered. Parents are steering their children into sports that they can play year-round, like baseball and basketball, to give them a leg up on making a college team.\nEven though coaches have tried to address their concerns by teaching new tackling techniques and monitoring head injuries closely, Houser said it could be very hard when \u201cparents get caught up in the \u2018let\u2019s don\u2019t take a chance\u2019 thing.\u201d\nThe headwinds are real, but football is still operating from a position of strength. In 2018, for example, nine of the top 10 most-watched prime-time broadcasts were N.F.L. or college football games. Football\u2019s golden age may be behind it, but whether it is in a slow fade, on the verge of a renaissance or heading for a collapse is a matter of debate.\nIn the coming weeks, The Times will examine football\u2019s hold on America, among children and their parents in the heartland, at public high schools and elite colleges.\nA significant decline in football\u2019s prominence would represent an important cultural shift in America. The sport long ago surpassed baseball as the true national pastime, both in terms of participation and fanaticism, and seeing its numbers drop represents a chance to understand in real time how quickly the ground can shift.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, boxing and horse racing ruled, then suddenly they did not. Few understood or explored the dynamics \u2014 safety concerns were growing, and entertainment options were increasing \u2014 while they were underway.\nCertainly, the 30 or so National Football Foundation board members in the room that morning two Decembers ago understood that they had to try to change the narrative surrounding their game. All were volunteers. All were there on their own dime. Most had played the game, and credited the lessons they learned on the field for their success. They were savvy businesspeople, and many were invested in keeping the sport a multibillion-dollar industry at the top of the nation\u2019s entertainment pyramid.\nThe organization was founded in 1947, when football was ascendant, by a war hero, a coach and a sportswriter: Gen. Douglas MacArthur; Army\u2019s coach, Red Blaik; and Grantland Rice of The New York Herald Tribune. They wanted to make sure football inhabited a sacred place in the American psyche. Its mission was straightforward: to promote football as a way to mold future leaders through sportsmanship, competition and academic excellence.\nBy the time that December 2017 meeting had ended, football\u2019s power brokers had decided to try to make that mission relevant in the 21st century.\nWithin weeks, money had started to roll in. Kraft and Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys and a foundation board member, along with Goodell, on behalf of the N.F.L., came up with several hundred thousand dollars. The N.C.A.A commissioners pledged to set aside money from the College Football Playoff. Several doctors offered their counsel, including those skeptical of research linking repeated head hits to degenerative brain disease.\nPractically overnight, rebranding football became perhaps the biggest part of the foundation\u2019s portfolio, next to maintaining the College Football Hall of Fame and honoring the academic achievements of collegiate football players.\nBy May 2018, the campaign #FootballMatters had begun to spread across multiple platforms. On the Football Matters website, there were resources for parents on rule changes and safety advances; articles about leadership and teamwork and overcoming adversity; and football-friendly data, such as the number of colleges that field football teams (775, with seven more being added by 2022) and the number of college players who are working on their master\u2019s degrees (1,439 out of about 73,000).\nEach Friday, fans who connect with Football Matters on social media get \u201chype videos\u201d of high school coaches\u2019 pregame talks to their teams. For casual fans, there is a documentary about Polynesian football or a YouTube video of a girls\u2019 tackle football league in Utah.\nThe five-year campaign has cost $2 million so far. The foundation\u2019s leaders say they have been careful not to allow the N.F.L. and the N.C.A.A., or their largess, to take the lead in a campaign aimed at everyday people. Is it working? It\u2019s too early to tell. Television ratings are rebounding after a period of decline, but participation has continued to fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change anyone\u2019s minds, but we hope to put football in a fuller context and give people enough information to make their own decisions,\u201d said Ken Luce, the founding partner of LDWW, the marketing agency based in Dallas that is running the campaign.\nOthers in the sport who want to maintain football\u2019s prominence have redoubled their efforts to build a better helmet, but the structure of the human head \u2014 hard skull, soft brain \u2014 makes that challenging. Pop Warner is pushing the idea that tackling can be safer, though many neuroscientists are skeptical. Teams and coaches at every level are decreasing the number of contact practices because scientists increasingly warn of the risk of not just concussions but also repeated head and body hits. No one knows how much is too much.\n\u201cWe are facing a lot of issues \u2014 the biggest one is that you can get hurt playing football,\u201d Hatchell, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cBut we have decided to be a player in the conversation. To push back.\u201d\nHatchell concedes that the foundation \u2014 and all of the game\u2019s boosters \u2014 need to be nimble and aggressive in telling people that their game is changing for the better. \u201cIt\u2019s still the most popular sport out there,\u201d Hatchell said. \u201cSo how do we continue to build on it?\u201d", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/08/sports/falling-football-participation-in-america.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share", "tags": [{"label": "football", "score": "0.95072"}, {"label": "college athletics", "score": "0.12733"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.11120"}, {"label": "interscholastic athletics", "score": "0.08827"}, {"label": "athletics and sports", "score": "0.06375"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.02266"}, {"label": "accidents and safety", "score": "0.02127"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01817"}, {"label": "draft and recruitment (sports)", "score": "0.01768"}, {"label": "roads and traffic", "score": "0.01752"}, {"label": "basketball", "score": "0.01464"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.01439"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01392"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01066"}, {"label": "wages and salaries", "score": "0.00823"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00775"}, {"label": "games", "score": "0.00770"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.00670"}, {"label": "editorials", "score": "0.00651"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00645"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.00628"}, {"label": "women", "score": "0.00581"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00551"}, {"label": "blacks", "score": "0.00533"}, {"label": "coaches and managers", "score": "0.00497"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00478"}, {"label": "colleges and universities", "score": "0.00467"}, {"label": "age, chronological", "score": "0.00450"}, {"label": "baseball", "score": "0.00412"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.00400"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Maiden", "N.C.", "California", "Florida", "Texas", "New York", "Texas", "Ohio", "Ohio", "Kansas", "North Carolina", "America", "America", "Utah", "Dallas"], "ORG": ["Inside Football\u2019s Campaign to Save the Game", "Maiden", "Maiden High School", "Maiden", "the New England Patriots", "N.F.L.", "Northwestern", "Hall of Famers", "the National Football Foundation", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "N.F.L.", "the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study", "Maiden High School", "The New York Times", "PredictWise", "Houser", "Maiden", "Houser", "N.F.L.", "Times", "National Football Foundation", "Army", "Red Blaik", "The New York Herald Tribune", "Kraft", "the Dallas Cowboys", "Goodell", "N.F.L.", "the College Football Playoff", "FootballMatters", "Football Matters", "Football Matters", "N.F.L.", "N.C.A.A.", "Warner"], "PERSON": ["Maiden", "Robert K.

She pulled into the lot of the Pasadena Waldorf School in Altadena, Calif., at 10:26 a.m. It was a gorgeous, clear morning, and she and hundreds of others walked among the bales of hay and suits of armor decorating the grounds for the annual holiday Elves\u2019 Faire. At 12:49 p.m. she pulled out of the lot, heading back down East Mariposa Street the way she came.\nAll afternoon the city hummed in every direction. Across town, K. was en route to a lunch at Din Tai Fung, a Taiwanese restaurant in Arcadia where he\u2019d arrive at 1:34 p.m. for a 54-minute lunch. M. stopped at Pasadena City College briefly, then made a trip to Home Depot. Others, like C. and J., went to church. There were evening errands: After a day with family, A. popped into a CVS at 6:57 p.m. C. took an evening trip to Costco. T. made a stop at AutoZone in Rosemead. Hundreds more shopped, ate, walked in the park, visited doctors\u2019 offices and coffee shops, and a few checked into hotels at odd hours.\nThe only thing out of the ordinary for the good people of Pasadena, Calif., about this particular Saturday is that three years later and 3,000 miles away in a newsroom, Times Opinion watched their every move unfold all over again. Minute by minute and inch by inch.\nWe pieced together some stories from Pasadena over a period of several months. Our eye in the sky wasn\u2019t a network of traffic cams or satellites but data exhaust spewing from smartphone apps buried in the pockets and purses of unsuspecting Americans.\nThe Times Privacy Project was given access to a data set with more than 50 billion location \u201cpings\u201d from the phones of more than 12 million Americans across several major cities. Each piece of information came down to a set of coordinates in time. The result is a tapestry of movement laid across a city grid \u2014 like the computer game SimCity, only real.\nThis granular location data \u2014 the kind that is collected by hundreds of mobile apps and then shared with dozens of location data brokers \u2014 may seem like a catalog of the mundane. But the aggregate is closer to total surveillance \u2014 an exact record of the rhythms of a living, breathing community.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nModern data surveillance relies on the ease of gathering but also the capacity to analyze giant sets of numbers. Run a set of numbers through a computer and the data becomes far more personal and invasive. Data points become a diary. A cluster of pings inside a secure facility reveals clues to the secretive role of an aerospace engineer. Visits to places of worship, trips to Planned Parenthood, a late-night visit to a bail bondsman \u2014 all collected in perpetuity and logged forever to be analyzed, traded and monetized. Each mark of latitude and longitude tells the story of the triumphs and tribulations of a life.\nAmericans would never consent to a government directive that all citizens carry a device that broadcast, in real time, their physical location and archived that information in repositories that could be shared among powerful, faceless institutions. Instead, Americans have been lulled into doing it voluntarily by misleading companies.\nIf a mobile phone is turned on, chances are its location is collected in a spreadsheet somewhere. What does it feel like to see that archive? We went to Pasadena to find out.\nTake away the temperate, cloudless days, the 90,000-plus people who pack the Rose Bowl at the start of each year and the imposing presence of the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, and Pasadena could be anywhere. Which is, in part, why we chose Pasadena. The data doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2014 it\u2019s collected from every town and city in America. Situated 11 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles and in the county of the same name, Pasadena is both of the city and not. Hollywood celebrities live there, but mostly to escape the crush of the Greater Los Angeles sprawl.\nThe city changes by the block. Palm-tree-lined streets with manicured lawns give way to suburban sprawl, drive-through liquor stores and laundromats. There are wildfires and gentrification. NASA and Caltech map the depths of the universe from here, while the public school district tries to provide a soft landing for a large influx of foster children.\nDan Paige, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, has to look after all of it. As a member of the city\u2019s Homeless Outreach, Search and Rescue, and the Community Emergency Response Team, he\u2019s accustomed to being the person doing the tracking. But without his knowledge a series of apps on his phone had been silently, scrupulously relaying his location. When we emailed to say we were in town and had a map of his movements, Mr. Paige agreed to meet. He didn\u2019t bother providing the station\u2019s address. \u201cHopefully with that data you have, you can track my exact location,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. Paige took over managing the Sheriff\u2019s Station social media accounts in 2012, and so he carries two phones and an iPad most of the time. In a dimly lit room where we met, he drummed his fingers on his county-issue iPhone 6 and let out a resigned laugh as we showed him a detailed map of his movements over a few months: shuttling to the dry cleaners, then to lunch downtown followed by a stop at Search and Rescue headquarters and finally to a E.M.T. training at a Glendale community college. When we showed him the thick red lines drawing a direct route from the police station to his home, he winced.\n\u201cIt is a little surprising,\u201d he confessed. As a law enforcement officer, he was concerned about possible threats against him and his family. In his line of work, any record of his home, as well as of the stores and restaurants he frequents, is a vulnerability.\nMr. Paige is not a stranger to technology and privacy. He meticulously strips photos of their metadata before posting them to the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s Twitter or Facebook accounts. He checks his permissions and helps educate fellow officers. But though he turns location services off on most of his apps, he\u2019s aware that it takes only one slip-up to transmit his exact coordinates \u2014 like everyone, he\u2019s only as secure as the weakest link in his chain of downloaded apps. \u201cWhenever you agree to an app, there's those eight pages of two-point font to read and, yeah, I'm guilty of not reading \u2014 just hit \u2018accept\u2019 and roll the dice,\u201d he said.\nAs they go about their daily lives, many Pasadena residents we spoke with, like the rest of us, frequent locations whose populations for one reason or another could be vulnerable \u2014 because they attend mosques or synagogues or work at secure facilities, like NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We plucked one scientist at the lab out of the data, and when we tracked him down in real life and explained how we did it, he was alarmed. \u201cSomebody who might want to get some information from [the lab] for instance, they might target me,\u201d the scientist told us. \u201cThis will be a treasure trove for any spying agency, I would presume.\u201d He asked that we preserve his anonymity in this story.\nFor Mr. Paige, seeing his location map laid out before him crystallized the risks to the community he has sworn to protect. He mused about the judges he knew in town, the prosecutors, the Hollywood celebrities and even the clergy whom someone might want to target. \u201cIf you were to compile a list of all the people that you feel could be vulnerable, it would probably be quite a few groups,\u201d he told us.\nAll of it seemed, to him, more than a little out of control. \u201cYou have that feeling of it being out of your hands,\u201d he said.\nAmong the most sensitive and vulnerable populations under Mr. Paige\u2019s guard is the student body at John Muir High, a labyrinth of classrooms tucked against the San Fernando Freeway. When we arrived, the din from a nearby on-ramp was drowned out by the Muir drumline, which was putting the finishing touches on a routine for the playoff football game against Chaffey High School that evening. The principal, Lawton Gray, was presiding over it all, wearing a Mustangs T-shirt for the occasion.\nAt Muir, 79 percent of the students are listed by the Pasadena school district as \u201csocioeconomically disadvantaged,\u201d and Dr. Gray, who is fiercely protective of the kids, has no shortage of concerns. He does home visits to help students who are struggling with their school work or their family lives.\nWe went into the school, sat down with Dr. Gray at a table in his office and pulled up the dataset for John Muir High \u2014 roughly 80 cellphones pinging across a six-month period. His eyes widened and he put his elbows on the table for a closer look at the laptop screen. \u201cWait, they\u2019re tracking individual cell phones? Oh, that\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. His eyes intensely scanned the screen. At first, he wasn\u2019t sure what was in front of him. He stopped on a particular clustering of pings, peppered across Muir High School and the surrounding area. \u201cWait. This isn\u2019t just everybody? This is for one person?\u201d Yes, we told him. His voice went hushed. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d\nAfter a minute, he exhaled, and referred to a certain movie from 20 years ago that we also find ourselves thinking a lot about these days. \u201cThis is almost like \u2018Enemy of the State,\u2019\u201d he said.\nHis thoughts went to the kids he knew who were having trouble with an abusive parent. \u201cI just think about those families,\u201d he said, letting out a short, exasperated sigh. \u201cIf there's child abuse or there's something going on and this parent has access to find out where this kid is even though they're not supposed to. That's what bothers me the most. Because I do know those situations.\u201d\nMany parents probably aren\u2019t aware of this, but there are only weak rules and regulations prohibiting the location tracking of minors. Many terms-of-service agreements for apps prohibit people younger than 13 from creating accounts, but it\u2019s really up to the kids and their families to enforce such rules. And with technology now everywhere in the classroom \u2014 much of it, like laptops, provided by some school districts \u2014 parents may not be aware how connected their children really are.\nDr. Gray zoomed out to see one device \u2014 very likely carried by a Muir student \u2014 and its lengthy data trail, a tangle of lines traversing the greater Los Angeles area. \u201cThere are no valid reasons that someone can tell me right now as to why they need to collect this data for people that are under 18 years old,\u201d he said.\nPaging through an entire city\u2019s location data is disorienting. Initially, there\u2019s the surprise at the ease of pulling needles out of the digital haystack. Draw a box around any given location, isolate a date or time and voil\u00e0 \u2014 the bird\u2019s-eye details of a life sprawl out before you. The first thing to notice is the granularity \u2014 precise movements, sometimes down to the inch. The precision is what feels most unnerving. Watching employees move from the cafeteria to their office and then idling in the parking lot feels less like a justifiable marketing insight than it does a pillar of the panopticon.\nAt the spreadsheet level, the notion of location tracking is abstract, almost a thought experiment. Corporations, hungry for Big Data, view mapping every move as an aggregation. But as you drive through Pasadena\u2019s quiet sun-drenched streets, the surveillance becomes real. From this vantage, a location data map of Pasadena \u2014 or any town \u2014 takes on a darker quality. Each device and its pings are a detailed diary of a given day and also a dossier: intelligence collected on neighbors, parishioners or a fellow traveler in the produce section of the grocery store. Sanctified spaces like synagogues, churches and mosques are transformed from sacred gathering places into revealing data points. But such data are a blunt instrument, an inference or educated guess as to one\u2019s identity. Show up someplace once and you\u2019re forever associated with it in a database someplace, context be damned. We saw single visits to spaces where patrons probably thought their trip was lost to time and masked in the cover of night: a stroll into the Church of Scientology storefront, a late-night stop at a massage parlor. Now, forever, those visits are recorded in a database and often tied directly to a home address, viewable by anyone with access.\nThe collective nature of privacy has even made its way to local law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern for everybody,\u201d John Perez, Pasadena\u2019s chief of police, told us. He suggested a leak of such data could even turn neighbors against one another. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start destroying relationships with families and people. At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be destroyed by it \u2014 and can we put it back together?\u201d\nAmericans don\u2019t have the vocabulary to adequately describe the experience and pervasiveness of digital surveillance. When we showed up on doorsteps, laptop in hand to inform people that their movements had been captured, sold and eventually supplied to us, many didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Shocked? In theory, yes. And yet many also assumed they\u2019d signed their data away long ago. Upset? Sometimes. They felt violated, but what could they really do about it? They were, when we visited them, alive and well, so how bad could it be? Many tried to describe a feeling but were unable to find the right words.\n\u201cI definitely don't like it,\u201d Linda Keavy, a schoolteacher, told us as she stood on her doorstep one Sunday afternoon. \u201cI don't know why they need that. And I don't know, I kind of get frustrated in that everything is about someone making money off of everything.\u201d\n\u201cAs sad as it is, it's kind of expected, I think,\u201d said Luis Chavez, an emergency-room technician. \u201cI'm sure a lot of people don't know that, they're just downloading some candy app, they have no idea.\u201d Mr. Chavez traced his data path and rattled off explanations for the pings. A trip to see a cousin. Commutes to the hospital. A few trips to the Subaru dealership where he bought his car.\nMr. Chavez, like others we spoke to, seemed mostly unconcerned about himself but worried more about others, like the patients who come into his emergency room and might be anxious about their privacy, which in theory is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. When we asked him what he\u2019d say to companies that collected the information, he was at a loss for words. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering, where does it go? It's too late to reclaim it now \u2014 it's just permanently out there. I don't know what I'd say.\u201d\nWhen confronted with their digital trail, people can get defensive. On doorsteps across Pasadena, people assured us they\u2019d already taken steps to protect themselves. They'd heard about Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and they notice when they\u2019re followed around the internet with targeted ads. They weren\u2019t surprised, but many couldn\u2019t suppress a sheepishness when we explained that we\u2019d been looking at them, as if they\u2019d done something wrong or been exposed for sloppy digital hygiene. Despite our assurances that there\u2019s little way to escape at least some location tracking, many seemed to blame themselves for getting caught up in a dataset they had no idea existed.\nSome people we identified just shrugged off the news. They saw themselves as unimportant, and so they thought there was little risk anyone would ever go to the trouble of de-anonymizing their location data and using it against them. Some simply couldn\u2019t imagine harm coming from such information, even when the data exposed the most personal corners of their lives.\nLike most digitally savvy folks, Ed Honowitz, a former small-business owner, figured that precious pieces of his data were ricocheting around unknown servers. He told us that while the location map trail in our dataset was alarming to see, he wasn\u2019t quite surprised. \u201cIt's not like \u2018Oh my God, I had no idea this existed.\u2019\u201d\nOne man we identified in the data \u2014 M. \u2014 was so concerned about his privacy that he insisted we not identify him by name and meet him not at his house, which is in a gated community, but at his place of worship. Of all the data trails we tracked in the region, his told the most poignant story. It showed a series of visits to a hospital by two phones, one of which eventually disappeared from the data. The pings chronicled the progression of an illness that eventually claimed the life of M.\u2019s wife.\nHe squinted at the information spread out on the laptop before him. The movements of his late wife were cherished memories for him. Did it seem wrong that they could also be corporate intelligence to a marketer? M. just shrugged. The trials of her illness, as painful and private as they were at the time, were summed up in a public obituary. Ultimately, he argued, the data was already out in the world. It had already traveled so far. So what if it was now staring back at him through the screen?\nRobert Howell, a professor of philosophy at Southern Methodist University, has identified what he calls the Peeping Tom Effect to express the indifference many people feel toward data surveillance. He says we have a visceral reaction only \u201cwhen we think about living, breathing agents observing our private lives.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t feel like such a personal violation when \u201ccorporations are collecting the same information and storing it on their computers.\u201d\nThis psychological bias in favor of faceless surveillance may explain why Amazon\u2019s Alexa smart speaker faced such a backlash after reports revealed that Amazon hired thousands of people to listen to the recordings. Few people had seemed bothered that Amazon could store conversations for eternity and using them for targeted advertising or other profitable ends. That feeling curdled only when Alexa users learned that real people were listening in.\nIt\u2019s also possible that many people just feel as if they never had that much privacy to begin with, even before the era of mobile phones and ubiquitous corporate surveillance. Some security and privacy researchers, like Munish Walther-Puri, argue this is the reason average citizens are resigned to invasive practices like location tracking: \u201cWhat is the value of privacy if you never felt like you had it to begin with?\u201d\nAnd yet the data is ours. It comes from the phones we bought, on mobile networks we pay to use. It chronicles our movements and our lives. It may be used to manipulate our behavior by nudging us toward a particular purchase or political candidate. It may be leaked or hacked or bought or sold to bad actors and abused. If that happens, we, not the corporations who hold our data, will suffer personal consequences.\nSitting at her kitchen table, Margie Homer couldn\u2019t stop following her past self. \u201cThat was a birthday party,\u201d she said hovering a cursor over the details of a Saturday afternoon nearly three years ago. Her two cats nuzzled at our feet as she leaned in toward our laptop. \u201cThat's the cafeteria, and that's the building that I primarily work in.\u201d She was gesturing toward a sprawling complex of buildings that make up NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a secure facility roughly the size of a university where Dr. Homer, a chemist, works on projects for space stations.\nDr. Homer is no Luddite. At J.P.L., she\u2019s surrounded by state-of-the-art technology and an army of number crunchers and data miners. Privacy warnings have rubbed off on her \u2014 enough that she has resisted the constant pleas of her pre-teenage kids for a smartphone. Aside from the occasional tracking mandated by her favorite guilty pleasure, \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d Dr. Homer assumed she\u2019d been a good steward of her location data.\nShe grabbed her Android off the table and started sifting through her apps, starting with those whose location permissions were set to \u201callowed all the time.\"\nCVS. Google Maps. Google search. Google V.R. services, which Dr. Homer didn\u2019t recall giving location permissions. Google Wifi and Chrome. Ikea. Amazon. AMC. Theaters. Pok\u00e9mon Go. She paused on an app from her school district that she hadn\u2019t realized had been hoovering up location data. \u201cThis is the problem with putting all this technology into people's hands when they don't really understand what's going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not stupid. In a sense, I saw it coming. People talk about it at work all the time. But it's a completely different thing when someone shows you a map.\u201d\nDr. Homer was outraged and frustrated. Scrolling through visits to friends and family, she worried that maybe her data might somehow reveal the information of those closest to her. She remembered political protests she attended \u2014 was her phone betraying activists around her? Staring at the data, it became easy to see what people frequently misunderstand: Privacy isn\u2019t just an individual matter. It\u2019s a collective concern. Dr. Homer\u2019s location wasn\u2019t just hers but was also intertwined with that of every person she\u2019d encountered.\nConsent is murky. Technically, each ping is collected legally, with the express consent of the device holder; apps can\u2019t collect GPS data unless you allow them to via a pop-up screen. But of the dozens of Pasadena residents we spoke with \u2014 even those unfazed by the detail of the data \u2014 none felt as though they\u2019d consented to this level of collection. \u201cUndoubtedly the whole industry benefits from the passivity of people, just not caring that much about what happens, or understanding, or worrying about it,\u201d said Mr. Honowitz, the former small-business owner we surprised with his data on his front porch.\n\u201cIf these companies actually walked us through their terms of service on these apps in a meaningful way, people would say: \u2018This is insane. I don't want to give you the right to do this,\u2019\u201d said Patrick Cahalan, a Pasadena School Board member.\nCollecting every scrap of our lives via smartphones is framed as a trade-off. If companies know where you are, they can serve you better information, like a personalized ad or a list of coffee shops near you. Pooling the data is even more useful. Companies can see trends, like traffic patterns, which may result in a faster commute. That\u2019s a persuasive argument.\nLocation tracking has always been an abstract idea. Consumers could never see behind the scenes and into the data.\nWhat happens when Americans parse the information companies actually collect on them? They begin to evaluate the true cost of their digital conveniences. For Dr. Homer the cost was this: the location of her home, her parents\u2019 house, her office, the site of a date and even her kids\u2019 favorite stalls at an annual holiday carnival. And while she\u2019s not entirely sure which app or apps was the culprit, she thinks it\u2019s entirely possible she traded it all for a few coupons for a reduced price on soup, the benefit she received for giving location permission to a hastily downloaded app.\nDr. Homer is lucky. What separates her from the tens of millions of us who\u2019ve traded our information is that she has seen the full exchange of values. Unlike the rest of us, she knows, down to the data point, the cost of her services rendered. Is it really worth it? That\u2019s a question not just people in Pasadena, but all of us, need to ask ourselves.\nCharlie Warzel (charlie.warzel@nytimes.com) is a writer at large for Opinion. Stuart A.

At the New York Stock Exchange \u2026\nof Los Angeles ...\nthe Pentagon \u2026\nTrump\u2019s Palm Beach resort.\nTwelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy\nEvery minute of every day, everywhere on the planet, dozens of companies \u2014 largely unregulated, little scrutinized \u2014 are logging the movements of tens of millions of people with mobile phones and storing the information in gigantic data files. The Times Privacy Project obtained one such file, by far the largest and most sensitive ever to be reviewed by journalists. It holds more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they moved through several major cities, including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nEach piece of information in this file represents the precise location of a single smartphone over a period of several months in 2016 and 2017. The data was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so. The sources of the information said they had grown alarmed about how it might be abused and urgently wanted to inform the public and lawmakers.\n[Related: How to Track President Trump \u2014 Read more about the national security risks found in the data.]\nAfter spending months sifting through the data, tracking the movements of people across the country and speaking with dozens of data companies, technologists, lawyers and academics who study this field, we feel the same sense of alarm. In the cities that the data file covers, it tracks people from nearly every neighborhood and block, whether they live in mobile homes in Alexandria, Va., or luxury towers in Manhattan.\nOne search turned up more than a dozen people visiting the Playboy Mansion, some overnight. Without much effort we spotted visitors to the estates of Johnny Depp, Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger, connecting the devices\u2019 owners to the residences indefinitely.\nIf you lived in one of the cities the dataset covers and use apps that share your location \u2014 anything from weather apps to local news apps to coupon savers \u2014 you could be in there, too.\nIf you could see the full trove, you might never use your phone the same way again.\nin New York City\nThe data reviewed by Times Opinion didn\u2019t come from a telecom or giant tech company, nor did it come from a governmental surveillance operation. It originated from a location data company, one of dozens quietly collecting precise movements using software slipped onto mobile phone apps. You\u2019ve probably never heard of most of the companies \u2014 and yet to anyone who has access to this data, your life is an open book. They can see the places you go every moment of the day, whom you meet with or spend the night with, where you pray, whether you visit a methadone clinic, a psychiatrist\u2019s office or a massage parlor.\nThe Times and other news organizations have reported on smartphone tracking in the past. But never with a data set so large. Even still, this file represents just a small slice of what\u2019s collected and sold every day by the location tracking industry \u2014 surveillance so omnipresent in our digital lives that it now seems impossible for anyone to avoid.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nIt doesn\u2019t take much imagination to conjure the powers such always-on surveillance can provide an authoritarian regime like China\u2019s. Within America\u2019s own representative democracy, citizens would surely rise up in outrage if the government attempted to mandate that every person above the age of 12 carry a tracking device that revealed their location 24 hours a day. Yet, in the decade since Apple\u2019s App Store was created, Americans have, app by app, consented to just such a system run by private companies. Now, as the decade ends, tens of millions of Americans, including many children, find themselves carrying spies in their pockets during the day and leaving them beside their beds at night \u2014 even though the corporations that control their data are far less accountable than the government would be.\n[Related: Where Even the Children Are Being Tracked \u2014 We followed every move of people in one city. Then we went to tell them.]\n\u201cThe seduction of these consumer products is so powerful that it blinds us to the possibility that there is another way to get the benefits of the technology without the invasion of privacy. But there is,\u201d said William Staples, founding director of the Surveillance Studies Research Center at the University of Kansas. \u201cAll the companies collecting this location information act as what I have called Tiny Brothers, using a variety of data sponges to engage in everyday surveillance.\u201d\nIn this and subsequent articles we\u2019ll reveal what we\u2019ve found and why it has so shaken us. We\u2019ll ask you to consider the national security risks the existence of this kind of data creates and the specter of what such precise, always-on human tracking might mean in the hands of corporations and the government. We\u2019ll also look at legal and ethical justifications that companies rely on to collect our precise locations and the deceptive techniques they use to lull us into sharing it.\nToday, it\u2019s perfectly legal to collect and sell all this information. In the United States, as in most of the world, no federal law limits what has become a vast and lucrative trade in human tracking. Only internal company policies and the decency of individual employees prevent those with access to the data from, say, stalking an estranged spouse or selling the evening commute of an intelligence officer to a hostile foreign power.\nCompanies say the data is shared only with vetted partners. As a society, we\u2019re choosing simply to take their word for that, displaying a blithe faith in corporate beneficence that we don\u2019t extend to far less intrusive yet more heavily regulated industries. Even if these companies are acting with the soundest moral code imaginable, there\u2019s ultimately no foolproof way they can secure the data from falling into the hands of a foreign security service. Closer to home, on a smaller yet no less troubling scale, there are often few protections to stop an individual analyst with access to such data from tracking an ex-lover or a victim of abuse.\nA DIARY OF YOUR EVERY MOVEMENT\nThe companies that collect all this information on your movements justify their business on the basis of three claims: People consent to be tracked, the data is anonymous and the data is secure.\nNone of those claims hold up, based on the file we\u2019ve obtained and our review of company practices.\nYes, the location data contains billions of data points with no identifiable information like names or email addresses. But it\u2019s child\u2019s play to connect real names to the dots that appear on the maps.\nHere\u2019s what that looks like.\nThe data included more\nthan 10,000 smartphones tracked\nin Central Park.\nHere is one smartphone, isolated\nfrom the crowd.\nHere are all pings from\nthat smartphone over the period covered by the data.\nConnecting those pings reveals a diary of the person\u2019s life.\nIn most cases, ascertaining a home location and an office location was enough to identify a person. Consider your daily commute: Would any other smartphone travel directly between your house and your office every day?\nDescribing location data as anonymous is \u201ca completely false claim\u201d that has been debunked in multiple studies, Paul Ohm, a law professor and privacy researcher at the Georgetown University Law Center, told us. \u201cReally precise, longitudinal geolocation information is absolutely impossible to anonymize.\u201d\n\u201cD.N.A.,\u201d he added, \u201cis probably the only thing that\u2019s harder to anonymize than precise geolocation information.\u201d\n[Work in the location tracking industry? Seen an abuse of data? We want to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, contact us on a secure line at 440-295-5934, @charliewarzel on Wire or email Charlie Warzel and Stuart A. Thompson directly.]\nYet companies continue to claim that the data are anonymous. In marketing materials and at trade conferences, anonymity is a major selling point \u2014 key to allaying concerns over such invasive monitoring.\nTo evaluate the companies\u2019 claims, we turned most of our attention to identifying people in positions of power. With the help of publicly available information, like home addresses, we easily identified and then tracked scores of notables. We followed military officials with security clearances as they drove home at night. We tracked law enforcement officers as they took their kids to school. We watched high-powered lawyers (and their guests) as they traveled from private jets to vacation properties. We did not name any of the people we identified without their permission.\nThe data set is large enough that it surely points to scandal and crime but our purpose wasn\u2019t to dig up dirt. We wanted to document the risk of underregulated surveillance.\nWatching dots move across a map sometimes revealed hints of faltering marriages, evidence of drug addiction, records of visits to psychological facilities.\nConnecting a sanitized ping to an actual human in time and place could feel like reading someone else\u2019s diary.\nIn one case, we identified Mary Millben, a singer based in Virginia who has performed for three presidents, including President Trump. She was invited to the service at the Washington National Cathedral the morning after the president\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s where we first found her.\nShe remembers how, surrounded by dignitaries and the first family, she was moved by the music echoing through the recesses of the cathedral while members of both parties joined together in prayer. All the while, the apps on her phone were also monitoring the moment, recording her position and the length of her stay in meticulous detail. For the advertisers who might buy access to the data, the intimate prayer service could well supply some profitable marketing insights.\n\u201cTo know that you have a list of places I have been, and my phone is connected to that, that\u2019s scary,\u201d Ms. Millben told us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the business of a company benefiting off of knowing where I am? That seems a little dangerous to me.\u201d\nLike many people we identified in the data, Ms. Millben said she was careful about limiting how she shared her location. Yet like many of them, she also couldn\u2019t name the app that might have collected it. Our privacy is only as secure as the least secure app on our device.\n\u201cThat makes me uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that makes every other person uncomfortable, to know that companies can have free rein to take your data, locations, whatever else they\u2019re using. It is disturbing.\u201d\n[Related: What\u2019s the Worst That Could Happen With My Phone Data? \u2014 Our journalists answers your questions about their investigation into how companies track smartphone users.]\nThe inauguration weekend yielded a trove of personal stories and experiences: elite attendees at presidential ceremonies, religious observers at church services, supporters assembling across the National Mall \u2014 all surveilled and recorded permanently in rigorous detail.\nProtesters were tracked just as rigorously. After the pings of Trump supporters, basking in victory, vanished from the National Mall on Friday evening, they were replaced hours later by those of participants in the Women\u2019s March, as a crowd of nearly half a million descended on the capital. Examining just a photo from the event, you might be hard-pressed to tie a face to a name. But in our data, pings at the protest connected to clear trails through the data, documenting the lives of protesters in the months before and after the protest, including where they lived and worked.\nWe spotted a senior official at the Department of Defense walking through the Women\u2019s March, beginning on the National Mall and moving past the Smithsonian National Museum of American History that afternoon. His wife was also on the mall that day, something we discovered after tracking him to his home in Virginia. Her phone was also beaming out location data, along with the phones of several neighbors.\nThe official\u2019s data trail also led to a high school, homes of friends, a visit to Joint Base Andrews, workdays spent in the Pentagon and a ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall with President Barack Obama in 2017 (nearly a dozen more phones were tracked there, too).\nInauguration Day weekend was marked by other protests \u2014 and riots. Hundreds of protesters, some in black hoods and masks, gathered north of the National Mall that Friday, eventually setting fire to a limousine near Franklin Square. The data documented those rioters, too. Filtering the data to that precise time and location led us to the doorsteps of some who were there. Police were present as well, many with faces obscured by riot gear. The data led us to the homes of at least two police officers who had been at the scene.\nAs revealing as our searches of Washington were, we were relying on just one slice of data, sourced from one company, focused on one city, covering less than one year. Location data companies collect orders of magnitude more information every day than the totality of what Times Opinion received.\nData firms also typically draw on other sources of information that we didn\u2019t use. We lacked the mobile advertising IDs or other identifiers that advertisers often combine with demographic information like home ZIP codes, age, gender, even phone numbers and emails to create detailed audience profiles used in targeted advertising. When datasets are combined, privacy risks can be amplified. Whatever protections existed in the location dataset can crumble with the addition of only one or two other sources.\nThere are dozens of companies profiting off such data daily across the world \u2014 by collecting it directly from smartphones, creating new technology to better capture the data or creating audience profiles for targeted advertising.\nThe full collection of companies can feel dizzying, as it\u2019s constantly changing and seems impossible to pin down. Many use technical and nuanced language that may be confusing to average smartphone users.\nWhile many of them have been involved in the business of tracking us for years, the companies themselves are unfamiliar to most Americans. (Companies can work with data derived from GPS sensors, Bluetooth beacons and other sources. Not all companies in the location data business collect, buy, sell or work with granular location data.)\nA Selection of Companies Working\nthe Location Data Business\nA Selection of Companies Working\nin the Location Data Business\nLocation data companies generally downplay the risks of collecting such revealing information at scale. Many also say they\u2019re not very concerned about potential regulation or software updates that could make it more difficult to collect location data.\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t really keep us up at night,\u201d Brian Czarny, chief marketing officer at Factual, one such company, said. He added that Factual does not resell detailed data like the information we reviewed. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like anybody should be doing that because it\u2019s a risk to the whole business,\u201d he said.\nIn absence of a federal privacy law, the industry has largely relied on self-regulation. Several industry groups offer ethical guidelines meant to govern it. Factual joined the Mobile Marketing Association, along with many other data location and marketing companies, in drafting a pledge intended to improve its self-regulation. The pledge is slated to be released next year.\nStates are starting to respond with their own laws. The California Consumer Protection Act goes into effect next year and adds new protections for residents there, like allowing them to ask companies to delete their data or prevent its sale. But aside from a few new requirements, the law could leave the industry largely unencumbered.\n\u201cIf a private company is legally collecting location data, they\u2019re free to spread it or share it however they want,\u201d said Calli Schroeder, a lawyer for the privacy and data protection company VeraSafe.\nThe companies are required to disclose very little about their data collection. By law, companies need only describe their practices in their privacy policies, which tend to be dense legal documents that few people read and even fewer can truly understand.\nEVERYTHING CAN BE HACKED\nDoes it really matter that your information isn\u2019t actually anonymous? Location data companies argue that your data is safe \u2014 that it poses no real risk because it\u2019s stored on guarded servers. This assurance has been undermined by the parade of publicly reported data breaches \u2014 to say nothing of breaches that don\u2019t make headlines. In truth, sensitive information can be easily transferred or leaked, as evidenced by this very story.\nWe\u2019re constantly shedding data, for example, by surfing the internet or making credit card purchases. But location data is different. Our precise locations are used fleetingly in the moment for a targeted ad or notification, but then repurposed indefinitely for much more profitable ends, like tying your purchases to billboard ads you drove past on the freeway. Many apps that use your location, like weather services, work perfectly well without your precise location \u2014 but collecting your location feeds a lucrative secondary business of analyzing, licensing and transferring that information to third parties.\nFor many Americans, the only real risk they face from having their information exposed would be embarrassment or inconvenience. But for others, like survivors of abuse, the risks could be substantial. And who can say what practices or relationships any given individual might want to keep private, to withhold from friends, family, employers or the government? We found hundreds of pings in mosques and churches, abortion clinics, queer spaces and other sensitive areas.\nIn one case, we observed a change in the regular movements of a Microsoft engineer. He made a visit one Tuesday afternoon to the main Seattle campus of a Microsoft competitor, Amazon. The following month, he started a new job at Amazon. It took minutes to identify him as Ben Broili, a manager now for Amazon Prime Air, a drone delivery service.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Mr. Broili told us in early December. \u201cBut knowing that you all can get ahold of it and comb through and place me to see where I work and live \u2014 that\u2019s weird.\u201d That we could so easily discern that Mr. Broili was out on a job interview raises some obvious questions, like: Could the internal location surveillance of executives and employees become standard corporate practice?\nMr. Broili wasn\u2019t worried about apps cataloguing his every move, but he said he felt unsure about whether the tradeoff between the services offered by the apps and the sacrifice of privacy was worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful lot of data,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I really still don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s being used. I\u2019d have to see how the other companies were weaponizing or monetizing it to make that call.\u201d\nIf this kind of location data makes it easy to keep tabs on employees, it makes it just as simple to stalk celebrities. Their private conduct \u2014 even in the dead of night, in residences and far from paparazzi \u2014 could come under even closer scrutiny.\nReporters hoping to evade other forms of surveillance by meeting in person with a source might want to rethink that practice. Every major newsroom covered by the data contained dozens of pings; we easily traced one Washington Post journalist through Arlington, Va.\nIn other cases, there were detours to hotels and late-night visits to the homes of prominent people. One person, plucked from the data in Los Angeles nearly at random, was found traveling to and from roadside motels multiple times, for visits of only a few hours each time.\nWhile these pointillist pings don\u2019t in themselves reveal a complete picture, a lot can be gleaned by examining the date, time and length of time at each point.\nLarge data companies like Foursquare \u2014 perhaps the most familiar name in the location data business \u2014 say they don\u2019t sell detailed location data like the kind reviewed for this story but rather use it to inform analysis, such as measuring whether you entered a store after seeing an ad on your mobile phone.\nBut a number of companies do sell the detailed data. Buyers are typically data brokers and advertising companies. But some of them have little to do with consumer advertising, including financial institutions, geospatial analysis companies and real estate investment firms that can process and analyze such large quantities of information. They might pay more than $1 million for a tranche of data, according to a former location data company employee who agreed to speak anonymously.\nLocation data is also collected and shared alongside a mobile advertising ID, a supposedly anonymous identifier about 30 digits long that allows advertisers and other businesses to tie activity together across apps. The ID is also used to combine location trails with other information like your name, home address, email, phone number or even an identifier tied to your Wi-Fi network.\nThe data can change hands in almost real time, so fast that your location could be transferred from your smartphone to the app\u2019s servers and exported to third parties in milliseconds. This is how, for example, you might see an ad for a new car some time after walking through a dealership.\nThat data can then be resold, copied, pirated and abused. There\u2019s no way you can ever retrieve it.\nLocation data is about far more than consumers seeing a few more relevant ads. This information provides critical intelligence for big businesses. The Weather Channel app\u2019s parent company, for example, analyzed users\u2019 location data for hedge funds, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this year that was triggered by Times reporting. And Foursquare received much attention in 2016 after using its data trove to predict that after an E. coli crisis, Chipotle\u2019s sales would drop by 30 percent in the coming months. Its same-store sales ultimately fell 29.7 percent.\nMuch of the concern over location data has focused on telecom giants like Verizon and AT&T, which have been selling location data to third parties for years. Last year, Motherboard, Vice\u2019s technology website, found that once the data was sold, it was being shared to help bounty hunters find specific cellphones in real time. The resulting scandal forced the telecom giants to pledge they would stop selling location movements to data brokers.\nYet no law prohibits them from doing so.\nLocation data is transmitted from your phone via software development kits, or S.D.Ks. as they\u2019re known in the trade. The kits are small programs that can be used to build features within an app. They make it easy for app developers to simply include location-tracking features, a useful component of services like weather apps. Because they\u2019re so useful and easy to use, S.D.K.s are embedded in thousands of apps. Facebook, Google and Amazon, for example, have extremely popular S.D.K.s that allow smaller apps to connect to bigger companies\u2019 ad platforms or help provide web traffic analytics or payment infrastructure.\nBut they could also sit on an app and collect location data while providing no real service back to the app. Location companies may pay the apps to be included \u2014 collecting valuable data that can be monetized.\n\u201cIf you have an S.D.K. that\u2019s frequently collecting location data, it is more than likely being resold across the industry,\u201d said Nick Hall, chief executive of the data marketplace company VenPath.\nTHE \u2018HOLY GRAIL\u2019 FOR MARKETERS\nIf this information is so sensitive, why is it collected in the first place?\nFor brands, following someone\u2019s precise movements is key to understanding the \u201ccustomer journey\u201d \u2014 every step of the process from seeing an ad to buying a product. It\u2019s the Holy Grail of advertising, one marketer said, the complete picture that connects all of our interests and online activity with our real-world actions.\nOnce they have the complete customer journey, companies know a lot about what we want, what we buy and what made us buy it. Other groups have begun to find ways to use it too. Political campaigns could analyze the interests and demographics of rally attendees and use that information to shape their messages to try to manipulate particular groups. Governments around the world could have a new tool to identify protestors.\nPointillist location data also has some clear benefits to society. Researchers can use the raw data to provide key insights for transportation studies and government planners. The City Council of Portland, Ore., unanimously approved a deal to study traffic and transit by monitoring millions of cellphones. Unicef announced a plan to use aggregated mobile location data to study epidemics, natural disasters and demographics.\nFor individual consumers, the value of constant tracking is less tangible. And the lack of transparency from the advertising and tech industries raises still more concerns.\nDoes a coupon app need to sell second-by-second location data to other companies to be profitable? Does that really justify allowing companies to track millions and potentially expose our private lives?\nData companies say users consent to tracking when they agree to share their location. But those consent screens rarely make clear how the data is being packaged and sold. If companies were clearer about what they were doing with the data, would anyone agree to share it?\nWhat about data collected years ago, before hacks and leaks made privacy a forefront issue? Should it still be used, or should it be deleted for good?\nIf it\u2019s possible that data stored securely today can easily be hacked, leaked or stolen, is this kind of data worth that risk?\nIs all of this surveillance and risk worth it merely so that we can be served slightly more relevant ads? Or so that hedge fund managers can get richer?\nThe companies profiting from our every move can\u2019t be expected to voluntarily limit their practices. Congress has to step in to protect Americans\u2019 needs as consumers and rights as citizens.\nUntil then, one thing is certain: We are living in the world\u2019s most advanced surveillance system. This system wasn\u2019t created deliberately. It was built through the interplay of technological advance and the profit motive. It was built to make money. The greatest trick technology companies ever played was persuading society to surveil itself.\nStuart A. Thompson (stuart.thompson@nytimes.com) is a writer and editor in the Opinion section.

I checked the clock. Three minutes had passed.\nI had just earned another 5 cents on a digital work marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk. At least I thought I had. Weeks later, I\u2019m still not sure.\nThere are lots of ways to make a little money in this world. Amazon Mechanical Turk, which since 2005 has flourished, to varying degrees, in an obscure corner of the globe-striding behemoth\u2019s empire, offers an uncertain, mystifying and often maddening way to make very, very little money.\nOn Mechanical Turk \u2014 named for a chess-playing \u201cmachine\u201d from the 18th century that concealed a living chess master \u2014 scores of thousands of humans earn pennies or dollars doing tasks that computers cannot yet easily do.\nIt works like this: Employers, known as requesters, post batches of what are called Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, on Mechanical Turk\u2019s website. A task could be transcribing an invoice, or taking part in a study, or labeling photographs to train an artificial intelligence program. (Occasionally a photo shows something disturbing, like a beheading.)\nFreelance workers, known informally as turkers, race to grab and do the tasks, providing what Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, once called \u201cartificial artificial intelligence.\u201d\nMost tasks pay a dime or less, and there is a daily churn of tasks that pay only a penny.\nAnd the weird thing is that workers \u2014 mostly American workers \u2014 will do them, for many different reasons.\nPeople turk to save for a motorcycle. They turk to buy insulin. They turk to pay off debt or pass the time profitably while on the clock at a boring job.\nSome do it because there are few decent-paying jobs that can be done at will. People who are confined to their homes by disability or social anxiety or who live where there are few jobs do it because, despite lousy wages, it seems like the best option.\nPlenty turk full time. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 3,000 American turkers, a quarter said they made most or all of their earned income on the platform. More than half the turkers surveyed said they earned under $5 an hour.\nTry Your Hand at Turking\nThroughout this story we\u2019ll give you the chance to do HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) that The Times has devised based on ones that novice workers like me encounter on Mechanical Turk. Click Accept & Work on any of the tasks below to get started.\nAt the end of the story you can see how much you would have made and how long it took you. Please note: You will not actually be paid.\nRequesterWestern Manhattan School of Business TitleReview a Crowdfunding Project Reward$0.01 Action\nAs little as turking appears to pay on paper, in practice it often pays less because MTurk, as it is known, is a sloppy, shoddy free-for-all.\nTurkers spend their time fighting requesters over an unfair 10-cent rejection or a missing 60-cent payment. They waste minutes filling out bubbles on defective questionnaires that cannot be submitted. They abandon \u201c10-minute\u201d surveys after half an hour.\nThey swap horror stories and warnings on turker message boards (\u201crejection on a $0.50 hit,\u201d read one recent bulletin, \u201creason is \u2018funds were not allocated\u2019\u201d). They leave scathing reviews on the turker-run site Turkopticon (\u201cunfair and wild use of the rejection button\u201d).\nJust how much turkers make is the subject of considerable scholarly debate, but one paper published last year analyzed millions of tasks done by thousands of turkers. Though they probably overrepresented novice turkers like me who do the lowest-paying tasks, the paper\u2019s authors concluded that if you count time spent looking for tasks and working on tasks that came to nothing, the median turker\u2019s hourly wage was $1.77.\nOnly 4 percent of turkers, the researchers found, made more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour.\nAdvertisement\nPresiding over this production is the world\u2019s biggest tech company, feet firmly planted on the sidelines. Amazon usually declines to get involved when turkers say requesters rip them off, even as it lets requesters hide behind aliases that can make them impossible to track down.\nIt has ignored turkers\u2019 pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17 to 50 percent; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon.\nAmazon even finds ways to recoup some of the pennies turkers earn, a reminder of the days when miners were paid in scrip redeemable only at the company store. While American turkers can get their wages direct-deposited, thousands of turkers overseas have only one way to get paid without incurring third-party fees: on an Amazon gift card.\nWhile Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, the company declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk. Minimum-wage laws generally do not apply to piecework jobs like turking.\nMechanical Turk is now one of a handful of big players in the field known as crowdwork or microwork. (One crowdwork company, Prolific, used by academic researchers, enforces a minimum wage: $6.50 an hour.)\nCrowdwork\u2019s proponents see a gleaming future \u2014 a borderless, no-overhead labor market where task-creator and task-doer meet at the intersection of supply and demand. Its critics see a throwback to something more Dickensian, where the lack of regulation and accountability keeps workers in the dark and on the defensive.\nMechanical Turk, in particular, combines the inconsistency and precariousness of gig work with Big Tech\u2019s tendency to dodge liability for the icky things that happen on its platforms.\n\u201cThis is a great little microcosm of what happens when you take away any rules and the wages fall to the bottom,\u201d said Kristy Milland, a former turker turned labor activist who was one of the authors of the paper that analyzed turkers\u2019 earnings.\nRequesterTrevor TitleTemplate Tagging Reward$0.03 Action\nThe bottom was where I dwelled during my brief tenure as a turker.\nI tagged blurry, surveillance-looking photos of construction workers on job sites according to whether they were wearing hard hats or harnesses (1 cent per photo).\nI helped train a virtual paralegal by describing a hypothetical injury claim (\u201cI suffered a serious injury because a defect in my lawn mower caused it to start\u201d) but earned nothing because the \u201csubmit\u201d box never popped up.\nI imagined myself as an \u201cactive investor\u201d and rated the prospect of my supporting a Kickstarter for a device that makes nut milk \u201cextremely likely.\u201d\nOver the course of several weeks in September, I completed 221 HITs in a little over eight hours of dedicated turking, and earned a grand total of $7.83. That works out to 97 cents an hour.\nBut hourly wages are not everything. Jane Lamont, a 30-year-old call center worker in Louisville, quit her $7.25-an-hour second job at McDonald\u2019s to turk.\nShe works from 7 to 11 on weeknights, five or six hours a day on weekends, and typically makes $5 a day.\nWhile the pay is \u201creally low,\u201d she said, she prefers turking to fast food for its freedom \u2014 freedom from having to wear a uniform, freedom to spend time at home with her mother, freedom to watch videos between tasks.\nBesides, she said, she would probably be online anyway \u2014 \u201cI like being paid while just being leisurely.\u201d On weekends, she brings her laptop to her boyfriend\u2019s house. While he\u2019s wasting time gaming, she\u2019s making money.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Ms. Lamont said. \u201cI feel like that money I can spend on extra things that I want,\u201d like two trips to New York City last year.\nKatie Boehm of Pittsburgh turned to turking in 2017 after her husband, who has diabetes, lost his job and insurance coverage. Her own health issues keep her from working outside the house, and turking seemed like a lifeline.\nShe turks at least 50 hours a week, sets herself a minimum goal of $20 a day and usually makes $30 to $50.\nHer husband\u2019s insulin costs $1,500 a month. \u201cMTurk covers about half of what he needs to survive,\u201d Ms. Boehm, 40, said. \u201cSilly insulin.\u201d\nRequesterData Capture, Inc. TitleExtract purchased items from a shopping receipt Reward$0.04 Action\nAmazon claims a turking work force of half a million, but independent researchers say the number of active turkers is smaller. An N.Y.U. data scientist who studies Mechanical Turk, Panos Ipeirotis, estimates that there are from 100,000 to 200,000 turkers, and that at any moment several thousand are doing tasks. The vast majority of turkers are believed to be in the United States \u2014 at least three-quarters, researchers say \u2014 with India a distant second.\nMechanical Turk was created to solve an in-house problem. In 2001, looking for help weeding out duplicate product listings, Amazon applied for a patent for \u201ca hybrid machine/human computing arrangement which advantageously involves humans to assist a computer to solve particular tasks.\u201d\nThe name was a homage to a contraption built by a Hungarian nobleman, featuring a bearded mannequin in a turban, that dazzled Europe with its chess-playing expertise. The moves were actually executed by a magnet-wielding human hidden beneath the board.\nMechanical Turk opened to the public in 2005 with considerable fanfare. \u201cMarket forces will define how effective it is for requesters and how lucrative it is for workers,\u201d an Amazon executive, Peter Cohen, said at the time.\nOne requester I talked to has found MTurk quite effective. For a year, Ryan Schefke, the founder of a Texas company called Lead Liaison, has used turkers to transcribe business cards that salespeople collect at events. The contacts go into a database of sales prospects, a process known as \u201clead capture.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMultiple turkers transcribe the cards to yield 99 percent accuracy, and the turnaround from the moment a customer scans a card is 10 to 12 minutes, Mr. Schefke said. A turker is paid 3 cents per card.\n\u201cBasically it\u2019s set it and forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nI mentioned that the one Lead Liaison task I did, transcribing a card covered in handwriting, took me 84 seconds, yielding an effective hourly wage of $1.29, and asked whether that was an issue for him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it would be relevant to us as a business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pay is per task, not hourly, and if a turker did one card and then went off to pick cotton in the field, that\u2019s up to them. I actually think that\u2019s pretty good wages. If you look at people in the Philippines or some other countries, it\u2019s pretty good pay.\u201d The minimum wage in Metro Manila is $1.17.\nMany major corporations have availed themselves of Mechanical Turk. The New York Times Company has used turkers for at least three data projects.\nMTurk also has big fans in the social sciences. Over 50,000 academic studies are conducted using MTurk each year, according to Leib Litman, a founder of CloudResearch, a company that helps researchers use the platform.\nTurking is not always low-paying. The most proficient turkers make upward of $12 an hour, using computer scripts and free tools like HIT Catcher and HIT Forker to beat their fellow turkers to the sweetest HITs and racking up special qualifications that open the door to higher pay.\nDr. Litman said that a small cadre of super-turkers actually do most of the tasks on MTurk and estimated that the average wage for turkers who take part in studies run with CloudResearch at $6.50 an hour.\nAmber Smoot is good at turking. She sits on the porch of her future in-laws\u2019 house in Middleburg, Fla., and runs HIT Forker in the background while she watches her dogs play.\nWhen the script catches a task that pays a dollar or more, her computer blasts a snippet of operatic rock and she grabs the HIT and sets it aside until she has a bunch. \u201cI\u2019ll queue \u2019em up and kick \u2019em all out,\u201d she said.\nMs. Smoot, 32, doesn\u2019t depend on MTurk to survive, but she knows that many people do. She spends a lot of time on message boards that offer tips to rookies.\n\u201cI love MTurk and I love the opportunities it gives people \u2014 it\u2019s great for what it is, a side gig,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the state of America is that people are turning to something that shouldn\u2019t be a job and trying to make a living off it.\u201d\nMost turkers are relatively young \u2014 the majority who answered the Pew survey were under 32 years old \u2014 but some are older.\nJeff Archacki of Corvallis, Ore., is 60 and a former I.T. worker and computer store owner. Since 2014, he has gotten by on disability payments for a hand injury, and turking.\nHe sits at the computer from 2 a.m. to noon, doing crossword puzzles while waiting for good HITs, and typically makes around $40 a day. \u201cI don\u2019t live a lavish lifestyle,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to the food bank or anything.\u201d\nMs. Milland, the turker advocate, said the biggest problem on MTurk was that requesters could decline to pay turkers by \u201crejecting\u201d their submissions, but still keep the work. \u201cI\u2019ve known a requester to be open about the fact that they automatically reject 10 percent of jobs to pay for Amazon fees,\u201d she said.\nTurkers have little recourse in dealing with shady requesters.\nOften, they have no idea for whom they\u2019re working. Many requesters operate under generic, untraceable names like \u201cEvents\u201d or \u201cPanel\u201d or \u201cDavid\u201d or \u201cJosh.\u201d\nThe task where I rated the patriotic quotients of photographs was posted by an outfit called Vision. I graded eight sets for Vision. At 5 cents per set, I should have made 40 cents. But Vision shortchanged me 15 cents.\nI clicked \u201cContact Requester\u201d and asked Vision to email me, twice. I never heard back.\nAdvertisement\nWhat was I to do? According to a Mechanical Turk help page, it wasn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s problem. \u201cIf you have questions about the instructions in a particular HIT, completing a HIT, or why your HIT was rejected, contact the requester,\u201d it says. \u201cPlease note that requesters determine when your HITs are approved.\u201d\nFor another requester, I transcribed handwritten disability findings. One contained the patient\u2019s name, describing him as \u201cfully disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to sit/stand for more than 90 minutes w/o pain.\u201d\nWhy was this presumably confidential patient information posted on Mechanical Turk, a platform open to anyone with access to an email address?\nThe requester, p9r, did not respond to my \u201cContact Requester\u201d query.\nSearching the p9r website for direct contact information, I found only the physical address of a public high school in Portland, Ore. A receptionist and a business teacher there said they knew nothing of p9r. Weeks later, p9r wrote back, but when I said I was a reporter, I was ghosted again.\n(Amazon has made one recent effort toward transparency. Since July, it has listed requesters\u2019 approval rates \u2014 valuable information for a turker who is deciding whether to do a task.)\nRequesterLiz TitleConsumer attitude toward video advertising Reward$0.05 Action\nAnother occupational hazard of turking is HITs that contain graphic imagery. A few years ago, Ms. Milland did some work describing photos circulated by the Islamic State.\n\u201cYou have to digest the content of the image in order to come up with the keywords,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThings like \u2018orange jumpsuit,\u2019 \u2018caged prisoner,\u2019 \u2018prisoner on fire,\u2019 \u2018kneeling on explosives,\u2019 \u2018basket full of heads.\u2019\u201d\nThe job paid 10 cents a photo.\nA few months ago, a turker who uses the screen name sprinkles123 did a HIT for a legal-services company that uses turkers as mock jurors. It involved a car-crash victim with multiple amputations and severe burns.\n\u201cThe case had a lot of pictures and I didn\u2019t even finish the HIT,\u201d sprinkles123 said in a direct message. \u201cI still think about it and wish I hadn\u2019t opened it.\u201d Such HITs are rare and usually come with warnings, and a turker always has the option not to complete a HIT, but turkers tend to finish what they start.\nProfessor Ipeirotis of N.Y.U. said his research indicated that Amazon itself was one of the biggest requesters and that it posted tasks under many different aliases. Amazon refused to say whether it posts tasks on Mechanical Turk.\nOn the $200 billion Amazon scale of things, Mechanical Turk is a tiny operation. Still, Professor Ipeirotis said he believed that more than $100 million worth of tasks were done on Mechanical Turk annually, of which Amazon\u2019s take would be tens of millions.\nTurking can be deadly tedious one minute, deliriously random the next. Recently on a Reddit forum, a turker named Mohammed Talukder posted something like a prose poem about the turking life:\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m doing it I think MTurk is making me crazy following dots with my eyes ..looking at kids starving.. asking me about hotel stays..telling me to bring up past experiences of trauma \u2026 judging faces so so so many faces \u2026 watching video clips about people stealing \u2026 judging the calories for foods..is this a cat or a dog?\nMy last tasks for Mechanical Turk consisted of looking at old paintings and coming up with 10 descriptors for each one: \u201cportrait,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201clong hair,\u201d \u201carchway.\u201d The job paid 1 cent per painting.\nThe requester was an Austrian print dealer, Meisterdrucke, that posts tens of thousands of artworks. I told Meisterdrucke\u2019s chief operating officer, Georg Petritsch, that it had taken me nine minutes and 15 seconds to do 10 of his HITs, for an hourly rate of 65 cents, and asked how he felt about paying people so little.\n\u201cIt would be a lie to say that we find it fair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut just yesterday, I saw a documentary about the \u2018garbage island\u2019 on the Maldives, where people work in burning garbage, risking their health and lives, and get $200 a month.

Auden\u2019s \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d (\u201cWaves of anger and fear / Circulate over the bright / And darkened lands of the earth\u201d). Yeats\u2019s poem, written just after World War I, spoke of a time when \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.\u201d Auden\u2019s poem, written in the wake of Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland, described a world lying \u201cin stupor,\u201d as democracy was threatened and \u201cthe enlightenment driven away.\u201d\nApocalypse is not yet upon our world as the 2010s draw to an end, but there are portents of disorder. The hopes nourished during the opening years of the decade \u2014 hopes that America was on a progressive path toward growing equality and freedom, hopes that technology held answers to some of our most pressing problems \u2014 have given way, with what feels like head-swiveling speed, to a dark and divisive new era. Fear and distrust are ascendant now. At home, hate-crime violence reached a 16-year high in 2018, the F.B.I. reported. Abroad, there were big geopolitical shifts. With the rise of nationalist movements and a backlash against globalization on both sides of the Atlantic, the liberal post-World War II order \u2014 based on economic integration and international institutions \u2014 began to unravel, and since 2017, the United States has not only abdicated its role as a stabilizing leader on the global stage, but is also sowing unpredictability and chaos abroad.\nA 2019 Freedom House report, which recorded global declines in political rights and civil liberties over the last 13 years, found that \u201cchallenges to American democracy are testing the stability of its constitutional system and threatening to undermine political rights and civil liberties worldwide.\u201d\nIf Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s dazzling 2015 musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d about the founders\u2019 Enlightenment vision of the United States, embodied the hopes and diversity of America during the Obama years, dystopian fables and horror-driven films and television series \u2014 including \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d (2016), a rebooted \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d (2019), \u201cJoker\u201d (2019), \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017), \u201cWatchmen\u201d (2019), \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (2017) and \u201cWestworld\u201d (2016) \u2014 spoke to the darkening mood in the second half of the decade, as drug overdose deaths in America rose to nearly half a million by the decade\u2019s end, life expectancy fell in the United States and Britain, and many of us started to realize that our data (tracking everything we viewed, bought and searched for online) was being sold and commodified, and that algorithms were shaping our lives in untold ways. In what was likely the hottest decade on record, scientists warned that climate change was swiftly approaching a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d; we learned that glaciers were melting at record speed at the top of the world; and fires ravaged California and Australia and threatened the very future of the Amazon rainforest.\nMany of these troubling developments didn\u2019t happen overnight. Even today\u2019s poisonous political partisanship has been brewing for decades \u2014 dating back at least to Newt Gingrich\u2019s insurgency \u2014 but President Trump has blown any idea of \u201cnormal\u201d to smithereens, brazenly trampling constitutional rules, America\u2019s founding ideals and virtually every norm of common decency and civil discourse.\nThe biggest casualty of the decade was trust. According to a Pew survey earlier this year, only 17 percent of Americans trust the government to do what is right \u201cmost of the time\" or \u201cjust about always.\u201d America\u2019s reputation tumbled even further on the world stage: A 2018 Pew survey of 25 countries found that 70 percent of respondents said they lack confidence that the American president would make the right foreign policy moves. Between the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term and late 2018, positive views of America fell 27 percentage points in Germany, 26 points in Canada, and 25 points in France. As with many things, Donald Trump is both a symptom and a radical accelerant of the decline in trust. While exploiting the anger at the establishment that snowballed around the world in response to the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Trump has also cruelly amplified existing divisions and resentments in America, fueling suspicion of immigrants and minorities and injecting white nationalist views into the mainstream, in efforts to gin up his base.\nMr. Trump\u2019s improbable rise benefited from a perfect storm of larger economic, social and demographic changes, and the profoundly disruptive effects of new technology. His ascent also coincided with the rising anxieties and sense of dislocation produced by such tectonic shifts. Around the world, liberal democracy is facing grave new challenges, authoritarianism is on the rise and science is being questioned by \u201cpost-fact\u201d politicians. Echoes of Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist populism can be found in Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain\u2019s recent electoral victory and the Brexit referendum of 2016, and in the ascent of the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil. Democracy is under threat in Hungary and Poland. Once fringe right-wing parties with openly racist agendas are rebranding themselves in Sweden and Belgium. And far-right groups in Germany and Spain are now the third-largest parties in those nations\u2019 parliaments.\nAt the same time, Donald Trump remains a uniquely American phenomenon. Although the United States was founded on the Enlightenment values of reason, liberty and progress, there has long been another strain of thinking at work beneath the surface \u2014 what Philip Roth called \u201cthe indigenous American berserk,\u201d and the historian Richard Hofstadter famously described as \u201cthe paranoid style.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an outlook characterized by a sense of \u201cheated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy,\u201d Hofstadter wrote in his 1964 essay, and focused on perceived threats to \u201ca nation, a culture, a way of life.\u201d Its language is apocalyptic (Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d is a perfect example); its point of view, extremist. It regards its opponents as evil and ubiquitous, while portraying itself, in Hofstadter\u2019s words, as \u201cmanning the barricades of civilization.\u201d\nThe \u201cparanoid style,\u201d Hofstadter observed, tends to occur in \u201cepisodic waves.\u201d The modern right wing, he wrote, feels dispossessed: \u201cAmerica has been largely taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it.\u201d In their view, \u201cthe old American virtues have already been eaten away by cosmopolitans and intellectuals,\u201d and national independence has been \u201cdestroyed by treasonous plots, having as their most powerful agents not merely outsiders and foreigners but major statesmen seated at the very centers of American power.\u201d\nOne well-known eruption of the \u201cparanoid style\u201d occurred in the 1950s with the anti-Communist hysteria led by Joseph McCarthy. It would surface again in the 1960s with the emergence on the national stage of George C. Wallace, who ran a presidential campaign fueled by racism and white working-class rage.\nIn his 2018 book \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d the historian Jon Meacham also wrote about the cycles of hope and fear in American history, emphasizing the role that presidents play in setting a tone for the country and defining \u2014 or undermining \u2014 its founding ideals. He wrote about presidents who have worked to unify the country and appeal to what Abraham Lincoln called \u201cthe better angels of our nature,\u201d and those who have courted discord and division.\nLincoln was followed in office by his vice president Andrew Johnson, a champion of white supremacy who pardoned more than 7,000 Confederates and opposed the 14th Amendment. Johnson was impeached in 1868: And while he was not convicted in the Senate, the historian Brenda Wineapple argues, the House\u2019s decision to impeach him implied \u201cthe glimmering hope of a better time coming, a better government, a fairer and more just one\u201d down the road in the years to come.\nMr. Meacham notes that \u201cextremism, racism, nativism, and isolationism, driven by fear of the unknown, tend to spike in periods of economic and social stress.\u201d Periods, that is, like our own, when change of every sort is blowing across the globe.\nThe event that turned people\u2019s sense of dislocation and disillusionment into populist anger on both the right (the Tea Party) and the left (Occupy Wall Street and, later, Bernie Sanders\u2019s candidacy) was the 2008 financial crisis. Trust in government had been in sharp decline in previous decades \u2014 driven by Watergate and Vietnam in the 1970s, and more recently by the invasion of Iraq and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction there, and by frustration with worsening partisan gridlock in Washington. But the lingering fallout of the 2008 crash \u2014 growing income inequality, declining social mobility and dwindling job security \u2014 ignited rage against the elites and the status quo.\nWhile the banks were bailed out and the fortunate 1 percent soon made back its losses (and more), working- and middle-class voters struggled to make up lost ground. Many students realized they were looking at jobs in the gig economy and years of crippling debt, while workers in the manufacturing sector found themselves downsized or out of work. As a candidate, Mr. Trump sold himself as the champion of such voters \u2014 whom he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women\u201d \u2014 and he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But once in office, he enlarged the swamp, hiring some 281 lobbyists, and set about cutting taxes for corporations and the very rich.\nHe also began a war on the institutions that were the very pillars of the government he now headed. In early 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s then adviser and strategist Steve Bannon vowed that the administration would wage a tireless battle for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d and the administration has done so ever since \u2014 nihilistically trying to undermine public faith in the efficacy, the professionalism, even the mission of the institutions that are crucial for guarding our national security, negotiating with foreign governments and ensuring the safety of our environment and workplaces. Mr. Trump also launched chilling attacks on those he reviled \u2014 from the F.B.I. to the judiciary \u2014 for having failed to put loyalty to him ahead of loyalty to the Constitution.\nThis is familiar behavior among authoritarians and would-be dictators, who resent constitutional checks and balances, and who want to make themselves the sole arbiters of truth and reality. A reporter said that in 2016 when she asked Mr. Trump why he continually assailed the press, he replied: \u201cI do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.\u201d It was fitting, then, that in January 2017, the month of his inauguration, George Orwell\u2019s classic novel \u201c1984\u201d shot to the top of best-seller lists. The nearly 70-year-old novel suddenly felt unbearably timely with its depiction of a world in which the truth is whatever Big Brother says it is.\nOne of the terrible ironies of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is that his administration\u2019s dysfunction \u2014 little to no policymaking process on many issues, impulsive decision-making, contempt for expertise and plunging morale at beleaguered agencies \u2014 creates a toxic feedback loop that further undermines public trust in the government and lends momentum to his desire to eviscerate the \u201cdeep state.\u201d The conflicts of interest that swirl around Mr. Trump and his cronies further increase the public\u2019s perception of corruption and unfairness.\nMeanwhile, tectonic shifts were occurring in technology: Not just game-changing developments in artificial intelligence, genetic research and space exploration, but also new platforms, apps and gadgets that almost immediately altered people\u2019s daily habits, including Instagram (2010), Snapchat (2011), the iPad (2010), Uber (2009), and digital assistants Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). In these years, we also developed a growing appreciation of technology\u2019s dark side: Gamergate, N.S.A. surveillance, Russian attacks on our elections, the fear that you might not only lose your job to a stranger on the other side of the planet, but also to robots in your hometown.\nIn the 2010s, we also became addicted to podcasts, and binge-watching became a thing. In fact, immersion or escape into compelling fictional worlds seemed to be one strategy people were embracing to cope with political outrage fatigue. Perhaps this also explains why nostalgia became so popular in the 2010s with reboots and returns of old television shows like \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d \u201cDynasty,\u201d \u201cLost in Space,\u201d \u201cRoseanne,\u201d \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon that\u2019s both a reflection of the retro-mania catalyzed by the endless availability of old content on the web and a longing for older, saner times.\nWith his calls to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump appealed to a different sort of nostalgia \u2014 for an era when white men were in charge and women, African Americans, Hispanics and immigrants knew their place.\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump and his campaign revived the culture wars of the 1960s and \u201970s, and politicized everything from football and Starbucks coffee cups (criticized by some evangelicals for being too secular and part of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d) to plastic straws and windmills. It might have been funny if we were living in a satirical novel, not in the real world with a former reality TV star as president.\nIn his insightful forthcoming book, \u201cWhy We\u2019re Polarized,\u201d Ezra Klein observes that \u201cour partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities.\u201d This is coming at a moment when the nation\u2019s demographics are rapidly changing \u2014 census statistics project that America will become \u201cminority white\u201d in 2045 \u2014 and putting more emphasis than ever on questions of identity. Our political identities have become so crucial to us, Mr. Klein writes, that \u201cwe will justify almost anything or anyone so long as it helps our side, and the result is a politics devoid of guardrails, standards, persuasion, or accountability.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a measure of just how partisan our politics has become that most Republicans now reflexively support Mr. Trump \u2014 despite broken promises, ballooning deficits, and tariffs that have hurt Americans, never mind the astonishing volume of lies he emits. Many Trump supporters inhabit a soundproofed echo chamber: A 2017 study, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, found that pro-Trump audiences got most of their information from an insulated media system, anchored around Breitbart News, that reinforced \u201cthe shared worldview of readers\u201d and shielded \u201cthem from journalism that challenged it.\u201d\nNo surprise, then, that the president\u2019s hard-core supporters stubbornly repeat the lies and conspiracy theories that cycle through his Twitter feed, connecting him with Russian trolls, white nationalists and random crackpots, or that Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions and fictional narratives are amplified further by Republican politicians and the right-wing media noise machine.\nSocial media, which came into its own in the 2010s, accelerated the filter bubble effect further, as algorithms designed to maximize user \u201cengagement\u201d (and therefore maximize ad revenues) fed people customized data and ads that tended to reinforce their existing beliefs and interests. This is why Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, increasingly have trouble even agreeing upon shared facts \u2014 a development that has undermined trust between different groups, fueled incivility and sped up the niche-ification of culture that began years ago with the advent of cable television and the internet.\nIn addition, platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have enabled politicians (as well as advertisers, Russian agents and alt-right conspiracy theorists) to circumvent gatekeepers like the mainstream media and reach out directly to voters. \u201cInfluencers\u201d replaced experts, scientists and scholars; memes and misinformation started to displace facts. As the news cycle spun faster and faster, our brains struggled to cope with the flood of data and distraction that endlessly spilled from our phones. And in an era of data overload and short attention spans, it\u2019s not the most reliable, trustworthy material that goes viral \u2014 it\u2019s the loudest voices, the angriest, most outrageous posts that get clicked and shared.\nWithout reliable information, citizens cannot make informed decisions about the issues of the day, and we cannot hold politicians to account. Without commonly agreed upon facts, we cannot have reasoned debates with other voters and instead become susceptible to the fear-mongering of demagogues. When politicians constantly lie, overwhelming and exhausting us while insinuating that everyone is dishonest and corrupt, the danger is that we grow so weary and cynical that we withdraw from civic engagement. And if we fail to engage in the political process \u2014 or reflexively support the individual from \u201cour\u201d party while reflexively dismissing the views of others \u2014 then we are abdicating common sense and our responsibility as citizens.\nIn his wise and astonishingly prescient \u201cFarewell Address,\u201d from 1796, George Washington spoke of the dangers he saw the young new nation facing in the future. He warned against \u201cthe insidious wiles of foreign influence,\u201d \u201cthe impostures of pretended patriotism,\u201d and, most insistently, of \u201cthe baneful effects of the spirit of party\u201d \u2014 imploring his fellow citizens not to let partisan or geographic differences plant seeds of mistrust among those who \u201cought to be bound together by fraternal affection.\u201d\nEvery portion of the country, he wrote, should remember: \u201cYou have in a common cause fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\u201d Citizens, he urged, must indignantly frown \u201cupon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\u201d\nMichiko Kakutani (@michikokakutani) is the author of \u201cThe Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Where Mr. Yang differs \u2014 beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience \u2014 is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.\nMr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.\nIn an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. \u201cHe really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are,\u201d a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. \u201cHis portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie\u2019s, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.\u201d\nHe articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang\u2019s approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.\nHere is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 90-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d The Times\u2019s TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about \u201cThe Choice\u201d, or meet the editorial board members]\nKathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?\nMr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.\nI was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.\nJesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?\nMy team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t show up with the helmet.\nKK: It looks sharp.\nI commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it\u2019s like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after \u2014\u2014\nHe\u2019s right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: \u201cCongresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.\u201d\nBrent Staples: Scrutinizing you.\nScrutinizing, looking after it, because I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhat? My hair? Who cares? No one.\u201d And then people are like, \u201cNo, no,\u201d and they have to put time in, smooth it out.\nKK: So let\u2019s get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?\nWow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we\u2019re not able to put food into people\u2019s houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign\u2019s based upon the premise that we\u2019re going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we\u2019re in the economy of the \u201970s or \u201980s.\nMr. Yang is not the first to label this period \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2014 the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab\u2019s book of the same name argues that \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.\nIn the \u201970s or \u201980s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, \u201cHey, I need to put food on the table,\u201d he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he\u2019ll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that\u2019s going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.\nStarting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged \u2014 productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nEspecially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.\nSo you\u2019re looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.\nSo for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they\u2019re dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people\u2019s hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans\u2019 hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.\nMr. Yang\u2019s candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income \u2014 which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)\nKK: So I assume you\u2019re referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don\u2019t really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?\nMr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.\nTo me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can\u2019t afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can\u2019t pay next month\u2019s rent, it\u2019s very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, \u201cHey, we need to fight climate change.\u201d And you look up and say like, \u201cI\u2019m worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.\u201d\nThe statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.\nAnd that\u2019s probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people\u2019s throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.\nEveryone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it\u2019s not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I\u2019m the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I\u2019m in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.\nDemocrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we\u2019re going to put buying power into families\u2019 hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here\u2019s the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, \u201cWait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend?\u201d And they look up, and they notice only one state\u2019s had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it\u2019s Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.\nSince 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state\u2019s mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed \u2014 crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund\u2019s value fluctuates with oil prices.\nThe reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens\u2019 hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone\u2019s decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans\u2019 hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.\nMr. Yang\u2019s argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact \u2014 the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.\nKK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?\nI haven\u2019t sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I\u2019ve talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I\u2019ve talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, \u201cHow many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software?\u201d Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.\nJamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he\u2019s proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I\u2019m championing.\nUnlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book \u201cCapitalism and Freedom.\u201d\nSo this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don\u2019t need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.\nKK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?\nI\u2019ve been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn\u2019t a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn\u2019t one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.\nKK: How much money did you raise?\nI want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.\nKK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?\nWell, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I\u2019ve been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they\u2019re lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I\u2019ve ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.\nMr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls \u201chuman-centered capitalism.\u201d\nKK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.\nIn hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.\nI like it already.\nAisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on \u201cSNL\u201d and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn\u2019t want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis\u2019s comments were maybe a year ago. So I\u2019m curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they\u2019ve done in the past?\nMr. Gillis was hired by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: \u201cAs a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.\u201d\nSo when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me \u201cJew chink\u201d \u2014 I think was the slur \u2014 my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, \u201cWho the heck is this guy?\u201d And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.\nAfter watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn\u2019t a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.\nParticularly because I think we\u2019ve become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, \u201cIf the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later.\u201d That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.\nThe comment about I wouldn\u2019t want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I\u2019d seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he\u2019d said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn\u2019t want to be called out for some misstatement I\u2019d made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn\u2019t really have full documentation of how I spent those years.\nMr. Yang was asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone \u201ctoo far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness.\u201d He responded: \u201cI\u2019m new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.\u201d\nSo the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one\u2019s statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.\nMr. Yang\u2019s comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of \u201ccall-out culture\u201d during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being \u201cwoke\u201d enough is \u201cnot activism\u201d and \u201cnot bringing about change.\u201d\nAH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re offended.\u201d And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn\u2019t show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?\nMr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian \u201cwho pushes boundaries\u201d and his \u201cintention is never to hurt.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\nWell, in this case, what\u2019s interesting is it\u2019s up to the employer, and it was NBC and \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Even as I made the statement saying I didn\u2019t think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you\u2019re NBC and \u201cSNL,\u201d you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He\u2019s not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn\u2019t worked a day on the set. Like, that\u2019s not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I\u2019d suggest that the extent there are consequences for people\u2019s misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they\u2019re doing. In Shane Gillis\u2019s case, he was a comedian. I\u2019d never heard of the guy before.\nAH: I mean, I don\u2019t think most people had.\nNo, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he\u2019d be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I\u2019d done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we\u2019re trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.\nAfter Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. \u201cLooks like we will be sitting down together soon,\u201d Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.\nKK: I think we have some questions around economics.\nBinyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You\u2019ve argued that this time, this won\u2019t happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we\u2019re confronting something new in all of human history?\nMr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.\nThe numbers. So keep in mind, I didn\u2019t just wake up and say, \u201cHey, technology is changing the world.\u201d I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.\nThis work was through Mr. Yang\u2019s nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.\nDetroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America\u2019s life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.\nMr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs \u2014 especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa \u2014 helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\nBA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.\nLabor force participation \u2014 the share of Americans either employed or \u201cactively looking for work\u201d \u2014 declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there\u2019s a counterargument to be found in demographic trends \u2014 the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.\nWell, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don\u2019t buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I\u2019m sure you know this, it doesn\u2019t measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn\u2019t include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.\nA 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was \u201calternative work,\u201d including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.\nUber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers.\u201d And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, \u201cCheck, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice.\u201d The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.\nRight now we have three flagship numbers we\u2019re beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.\nThe American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.\nIf these are your measurements, then of course you\u2019re going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.\nIf you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We\u2019re riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we\u2019re in a mental health recession or depression, we\u2019re in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don\u2019t need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.\nGross domestic product is a measure of a country\u2019s entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens\u2019 well-being. Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.\nBA: But you\u2019re not proposing to fix any of that. People don\u2019t just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You\u2019re proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?\nI love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.\nHarmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.\nThe question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I\u2019m suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult \u2026 Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let\u2019s say after I\u2019m president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It\u2019s going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.\nIf you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it\u2019s a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you\u2019re going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community\u2019s needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to designate five people to clean up this park forever.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re \u2014\u2014\u201d\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn\u2019t have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.\nBA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat \u2014 you don\u2019t think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?\nOh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it\u2019s designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That\u2019s why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.\nAnd again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don\u2019t need any clearer divergence than that.\nMr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.\nWhat I\u2019m suggesting is we actually make capitalism\u2019s goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children\u2019s education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.\nBA: I want to ask you about the \u2014 Oh, sorry, go ahead.\nKK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America\u2019s high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn\u2019t that a path? Why couldn\u2019t we instead change how we do education in this country?\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.\nWe should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that\u2019s 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?\nOne, it\u2019s a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to go to college,\u201d than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that\u2019s not college. We\u2019ve beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone\u2019s going to college and say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to work for you.\u201d And the Democrats are guilty of this. That\u2019s why they\u2019re yelling, \u201cFree college, free college.\u201d Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.\nThe question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of \u201cfree college for all,\u201d but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.\nKK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.\nPresident Obama referred to education as the \u201ccivil rights issue of our time,\u201d as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.\nIt very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don\u2019t necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.\nMost American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research \u2014 in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.\nOur economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you\u2019re in the top third of the population, you\u2019re graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there\u2019s a 40 to 44 percent chance you\u2019re going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That\u2019s if you\u2019re one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you\u2019re a nonwinner, what this looks like.\nBS: Would you dilate what you\u2019re talking \u2014 seven years doing what?\nI started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I\u2019m very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I\u2019m running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re going through the greatest economic transformation.\nMr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country\u2019s most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.\nBA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.\nOf course, sure.\nBA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you\u2019re proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you\u2019re relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You\u2019ve proposed some offsets, but I still don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren\u2019t you trying to help them as much as possible?\nA VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.\nI\u2019m for a more progressive tax structure. It\u2019s clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don\u2019t think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries\u2019 experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.\nSo if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you\u2019re a trillion-dollar technology company \u2014 you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it\u2019s up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries \u2014\u2014\nIn 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy \u2014 Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn\u2019t raise as much revenue as anticipated.\nBA: But that doesn\u2019t make our tax code more progressive.\nSo if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we\u2019re taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.\nBA: But just to be clear, it\u2019s still not a progressive tax. There\u2019s no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You\u2019re still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.\nA progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.\nIn a vacuum, you\u2019re 100 percent correct. But it\u2019s failing to account for the fact that we\u2019re taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.\nBA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you\u2019re proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You\u2019re saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.\nA working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.\nLet\u2019s say I\u2019m on food stamps, and I\u2019ve got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I\u2019m concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I\u2019m going to say, wow. That\u2019s actually the biggest value gain I\u2019ve ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.\nOther candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth \u2014 Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.\nThis is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we\u2019re trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I\u2019m all for it.\nKK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep \u2014 doesn\u2019t that contribute to income inequality in the United States?\nMr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country\u2019s foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.\nYeah, it does. It\u2019s one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize \u2014 excuse me.\nKK: Take your time.\nNot at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I\u2019ve talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I\u2019ve said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents\u2019 socioeconomic status than anything else.\nThe SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.\nSo we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you\u2019re teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.\nKK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?\nI believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim\u2019s contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.\nIn an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would \u201ccontinue working as hard\u201d after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on \u201cThe View\u201d shortly after and said there was \u201czero truth\u201d to Ms. Watkins\u2019s account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error \u2014 she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , \u201cI have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to \u2018pay equity,\u2019 with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity\u2026Yang\u2019s response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.\u201d\nNick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?\nIf you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I\u2019m for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.\nA Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang\u2019s tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.\nMichelle Cottle: Now, I think it\u2019s clear that people are responding to you in part because you have this big vision, but Washington has a problem achieving even kind of modest \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.\nYeah, we noticed.\nMC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.\nMany of Mr. Yang\u2019s supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.\nWell, it sounds like you\u2019ve been there.\nMC: Quite a lot.\nDid you come up for this?\nMC: Yeah, I\u2019m based out of \u2014\u2014\nOh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they\u2019re going to run government like a business does not know what they\u2019re talking about, because they are two completely different things.\nIn a business you can say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to go this way,\u201d and people generally have to do what you\u2019re saying. In government it\u2019s much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it\u2019s in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you\u2019re willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.\nMr. Yang told Vox\u2019s Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn\u2019t achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.\nDonald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you\u2019ve seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.\nOne of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They\u2019ve been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it\u2019s not just Donald Trump\u2019s victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump\u2019s win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.\nKK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?\nI think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it\u2019s very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could\u2019ve kept many of these communities \u2014\u2014\nA critique of President Obama\u2019s financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.\nBS: Without a doubt.\n\u2014\u2014 more strong and more whole. There\u2019s a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this \u2026 no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, \u201cHey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street\u201d? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, \u201cWait, we did that\u201d? And it\u2019s, \u201cOf course we didn\u2019t vote for that.\u201d\n\u201cA crisis is a terrible thing to waste\u201d is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama\u2019s election.\nSo, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we\u2019re still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had \u2014 my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.\nMr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?\nI love this question.\nLK: So do we.\nWell, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I\u2019m on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it\u2019s mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.\nMr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.\nMC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]\nBut at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I\u2019m still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.\nMr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting \u201cI miss Beto.\u201d\nLK: So no names yet.\nNo names yet, no.\nKK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?\nAlmost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we\u2019d still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.\nLK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven\u2019t seen any details about what actions you\u2019re considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?\nWell, I\u2019m all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren\u2019t any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women\u2019s reproductive rights.\nMr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think male legislators should be weighing in on women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedoms.\u201d\nKK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?\nIn addition to the nine we already have. I believe that \u2014 so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We\u2019ve had fewer than nine, we\u2019ve had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it\u2019s not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we\u2019re hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?\nJustice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.\nJW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?\nYeah. And I think in some ways, there\u2019s some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a \u201ccourt-packing\u201d strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court\u2019s justices.\nKK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?\nThat\u2019s a fun exercise, too. I haven\u2019t gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women\u2019s reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.\nI think it\u2019s actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, \u201cHey, what did you decide\u201d? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we\u2019d have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don\u2019t have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.\nWe need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death\u2019s door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.\nWe should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it\u2019s predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don\u2019t need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you\u2019re literally looking at the age of the person you\u2019re appointing being, \u201cOoh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years.\u201d What kind of system do you want where you\u2019re having a society decide 30 years ago what women\u2019s rights are today? Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nJW: Are you concerned that you wouldn\u2019t be triggering a sort of a war of \u2014 a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?\nIf you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because \u2014\u2014\nJW: Right, but you\u2019re talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it\u2019s a federal law, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn\u2019t that just become \u2014 doesn\u2019t devolve into \u2014\u2014\nCourt packing isn\u2019t a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.\nBS: An arms race.\nWell, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it\u2019s only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk \u2014 oh.\nJeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.\nJW: I just wanted to tie together the question \u2014 a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don\u2019t need a \u2014 you were talking about various [cross talk].\nYeah, you said you don\u2019t need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?\nTo your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it\u2019s, \u201cHey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum.\u201d And that\u2019s a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.\nEarmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.\nJW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don\u2019t take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court \u2014 how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?\nIt\u2019s obviously much harder. I\u2019m all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don\u2019t get a majority \u2014 I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I\u2019m very optimistic that way, but we\u2019re going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, \u201cAt least we\u2019re going to get this.\u201d\nThe editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: \u201cBuild the Donald J. Trump Tunnel.\u201d The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.\nKK: We\u2019ve called for that, too.\nReally? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I\u2019d be excited to lead with that. I mean, I\u2019d be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that\u2019s bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, \u201cHey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes\u201d? They\u2019re not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they\u2019re generally correct, and that is bipartisan.\nJI: You\u2019ve proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.\nKK: Online.\nJI: Yeah, online gambling.\nJust online poker.\nJI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn\u2019t get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?\nAny American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it\u2019s illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it\u2019s not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they\u2019re not getting cheated, we know they\u2019re not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.\nMr. Yang\u2019s campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.\nJI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?\nI mean, you could make it so it\u2019s analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there\u2019s a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.\nPresident Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.\nJI: In that system, a lot of that money didn\u2019t actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best model.\nIn 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.\nOh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn\u2019t trust the states to actually use it in the right way.\nJI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you\u2019re on food stamps and you\u2019re worried about your kids\u2019 future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn\u2019t your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?\nThat is correct. But when I\u2019ve dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, \u201cHey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon,\u201d they actually think that\u2019s too good to be true.\nJI: Sure. But to Binya\u2019s point, it\u2019s still a trade-off. So, if I\u2019m on food stamps, I\u2019m getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who\u2019s not on food stamps.\nWell to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it\u2019s you can\u2019t calibrate it precisely to everyone\u2019s individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?\nKK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.\nReally?\nKK: I think Mara\u2019s going to kick you off.\nMG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?\nDefinitely aliens, of course.\nKK: O.K.\nThat\u2019d be my first question if I got in there, I\u2019d be, \u201cAll right, let me see them. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve been hiding all of these years.\u201d\nKK: And, who has broken your heart?\nWow, these questions are really fun. Who\u2019s broken my heart?\nBS: Don\u2019t be tactical now.\nThis is \u2014 I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we\u2019d missed a great opportunity. So, I\u2019d say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don\u2019t think opportunities like that come along very often.\nThe Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.\nKK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?\nI grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who\u2019s Christian. And so, we\u2019re raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I\u2019m home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I\u2019m unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.\nMr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.\nBS: Which denomination?\nIt\u2019s a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They\u2019ve got a rainbow flag up front. It\u2019s a very welcoming community.\nMr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.\nMG: Actually just a quick follow-up. When was the last time you rode the subway?\nI rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It\u2019s become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that\u2019s been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to get recognized on the street.\u201d Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there\u2019s also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn\u2019t work anymore.\nWhen I\u2019m on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, \u201cHey, you running for president\u201d? And then I\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d They\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month,\u201d something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it\u2019s safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I\u2019ll be \u2014 and then there\u2019s this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you\u2019ve taken the pictures with him, you\u2019re still sitting there. And so then they\u2019re, \u201cSo, where are you going? Or, how\u2019s Bernie\u201d? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I\u2019ve ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it\u2019s generally too late.\nKK: I thought you were going to say it\u2019s a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York\u2019s subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper\u2019s millions of readers.\nThat too. I mean, it\u2019s rough. But I mean, New York\u2019s going through \u2014 I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we\u2019re coasting on the investments made decades ago and they\u2019re starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism \u2014 I\u2019ve been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don\u2019t have local journalism.\nA report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.\nThis, to me, is an emblem of what\u2019s gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of \u2014 like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you\u2019re like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it\u2019s like a unique privilege because the people who\u2019ve pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.\nKK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?\nYes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you\u2019re not like saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to do this.\u201d But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.\nOne criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media\u2019s capacity to serve as a watchdog.\nYou can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it\u2019s made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won\u2019t.\nKK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we\u2019ll move on to foreign policy, if you don\u2019t mind?\nSure. Yeah.\nAlex Kingsbury: Another thing the country\u2019s invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you\u2019d be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?\nOh my gosh.\nAK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What\u2019s going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?\nI think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we\u2019re spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.\nThe correct answer is 11.\nWhat are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It\u2019s very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That\u2019s very, very difficult. So we\u2019re entering an era where it\u2019s going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don\u2019t need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We\u2019re spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.\nAK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might\u2019ve left \u2014\u2014\nI saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, \u201cOh man, this is really \u2014 we really have to put an end to this administration.\u201d\nMr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.\nAK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that\u2019s a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that\u2019s something that should be a priority for the United States.\nTo me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.\nWe need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that\u2019s not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that\u2019s benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we\u2019ve been allies with for decades.\nIn response to announcements about Mr. Trump\u2019s planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis\u2019s 2013 comment, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\u201d\nAK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine\u2019s received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?\nI mean, that\u2019s not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I\u2019m sympathetic, but it\u2019s not a decision we can make alone.\nA recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary\u2019s foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens\u2019 use of minority languages.\nKK: Do you think \u2014 speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?\nThis is what\u2019s so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey\u2019s relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.\nSerge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He\u2019s moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he\u2019s recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?\nHistorically, we\u2019ve endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it\u2019s really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.\nMr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump\u2019s policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cI don\u2019t want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.\u201d\nSS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?\nSo I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm\u2019s way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take this long and you\u2019re going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you\u2019re going to be able to come home.\u201d And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you\u2019re going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we\u2019re not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm\u2019s way.\nGenerally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I\u2019ve signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it\u2019s in Congress\u2019s hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, \u201cHey, executive branch, you can do what you want.\u201d And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it\u2019s not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, \u201cLook, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.\u201d\nCommon Defense\u2019s \u201cEnd the Forever War\u201d pledge advocates for an \u201cexpedient conclusion\u201d to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).\nSS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?\nNo. I\u2019d have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.\nJames Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?\nI have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it\u2019s incredibly jarring, and it\u2019s an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong\u2019s status as this semiautonomous region that\u2019s being reintegrated back into China.\nOur best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can\u2019t just moralize and say, \u201cHey, do the right thing.\u201d Because at this point they\u2019re looking at us and saying like, \u201cKeep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.\u201d\nWe have to be working toward China\u2019s second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, \u201cLook, the economic costs are going to be very, very high.\u201d And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.\nAt the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China\u2019s in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They\u2019re investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It\u2019s a national effort. And they\u2019ve now separated their technology ecosystem from the West\u2019s and they\u2019re trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.\nThat\u2019s why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they\u2019re going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don\u2019t flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.\nMr. Yang has been critical of China\u2019s \u201cincreasingly authoritarian\u201d behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate \u201ca model for democratic capitalism.\u201d\nKK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?\nI think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.\nCharlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that\u2019s a good segue into some of the \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I\u2019m curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn\u2019t it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?\nMr. Yang has proposed what he describes as \u201ca W.T.O. for data\u201d and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.\nSo this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to adhere to that.\u201d Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they\u2019re in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That\u2019s one reason why they\u2019ve banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.\nThere has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong\u2019s law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.\nBut for them the challenge is not even what\u2019s happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you\u2019re a third party, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you\u2019re the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that\u2019s going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you\u2019re building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.\nCW: I\u2019m curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you\u2019re looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than \u2014\u2014\nKK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.\nWell, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it\u2019d be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who\u2019s a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the \u201cdigital attention crisis.\u201d\nKK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that\u2019s your question, right?\nCW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.\nSo the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we\u2019ve seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They\u2019re all at Space X and Blue Origin and they\u2019re there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you\u2019re a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It\u2019s like if you\u2019re working in the private sector, you feel like you\u2019re going to go faster, you\u2019re certainly going to get paid more. You\u2019re going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?\nKK: Yeah, that\u2019s literally our question.\nAY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it\u2019s gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.\nThrough Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities \u2014 but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.\nCW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don\u2019t want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?\nBS: Any more than they already are.\nCW: More than they already are. Right.\nMore than they already are.\nCW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?\nI mean, the question is what trade-offs you\u2019re willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing \u2014\u2014\nCW: They\u2019re worried about it.\nThey should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they\u2019re going. So one thing you can do that\u2019s very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.\nSo if you had, for example, a rule that said, \u201cLook, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you\u2019d have more success.\u201d If you said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that\u2019s like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.\u201d\nMr. Yang has said \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government\u201d and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.\nIt seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It\u2019s like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the \u2014\u2014\nBS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?\nHm?\nBS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.\nSee The New Yorker satirizing the Affordable Care Act rollout here.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they\u2019re all using technology from the \u201990s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, \u201cNo, we just wanted you to do it manually forever.\u201d So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.\nCW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren\u2019s taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?\nThe 21st-century framework. First, you don\u2019t use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, \u201cWhat? We would never gouge anyone. It\u2019s free. We\u2019re underselling everyone.\u201d So that you have to get rid of, and that\u2019s not something she\u2019s advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country\u2019s approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.\nLet me explain. I\u2019m a parent. I\u2019ve got \u2014 how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, \u201cWhat\u2019s more important? People or screens?\u201d And they know the right answer\u2019s people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, \u201cPeople, people.\u201d And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there\u2019s not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that\u2019s how they make their millions of dollars.\nSo if that\u2019s your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.\nSo if that\u2019s your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, \u201cWhat are the design choices you made?\u201d Let\u2019s calibrate them so they actually balance our kids\u2019 health and not just your financial returns. So that\u2019s one way she\u2019s missing the point.\nThe other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to break you up.\u201d Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh.\u201d You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, \u201cLook, you\u2019re the winner in the space. We\u2019re going to break you up,\u201d it doesn\u2019t revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn\u2019t actually end up solving the competition problem.\nIf you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, \u201cLook, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria.\u201d That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It\u2019s just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they\u2019ll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you\u2019re rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn\u2019t even matter what they do with your business at that point.\nOver the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.\nBA: You\u2019ve expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?\nI do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they\u2019re realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.\nCW: Going back though, my question is, there\u2019s an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there\u2019s still going to be addictive products, but there\u2019s an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won\u2019t tell us about, I mean, how do you \u2014 if you don\u2019t break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?\nNF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?\nYes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.\nSo, and I know The New York Times, I mean you\u2019ve had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.\nListening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.\nSo, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re totally outgunned. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\nSo you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, \u201cLook, here are the list of problems we\u2019re concerned about.\u201d But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong.\u201d What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you\u2019re concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.\nCW: Who else besides you that you\u2019re running against understands the internet?\nI haven\u2019t hung out with enough of them to know, but I\u2019m confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]\u2014\u2014\nCW: What\u2019s your gut feeling? Who gets it?\nI\u2019m going to say I do not have confidence that any of my opponents get the internet.\nKK: We\u2019re running out of time. So I\u2019m actually going to \u2014 Jesse has one last question.\nOne area we had hoped to ask about but ran out of time was climate solutions, specifically diving deep on his plans for nuclear energy.\nJesse Wegman: I wanted to ask you \u2014 I was looking at the pin on your lapel, \u201cMATH,\u201d and I just wanted you to sort of get down to nuts and bolts a little with regard to what you\u2019re trying to do here. What\u2019s your math to winning the \u2014\u2014\nThe slogan stands for \u201cMake America Think Harder.\u201d\nTo victory?\nKK: Can we add to that? What do you attribute your fund-raising to from last month? Taking in $750,000 in 24 hours.\nWell, we put up a goal on the website, and my supporters do not like to miss goals. And so we just had an aggressive goal, and we were $750,000 short in the last day. So then we raised $750,000 in that day and then we made the goal. So it turns out having goals is very positive for human beings, and our campaign\u2019s continuing to grow by leaps and bounds. That\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re going to shock the world when the voting starts in February.\nMr. Yang surprised the Democratic field with a 257 percent fund-raising surge in October.\nKK: So walk us through Jesse\u2019s \u2014\u2014\nJW: So you\u2019re polling in the low single digits now. What\u2019s the math to get you into the top tier and through the first primary states?\nSure. So if you look at the numbers, you\u2019ve seen the same things that we see. You have four front-runners, but the support is very, very soft. Most people are saying they could change their mind. And there are a lot of people that say they still have not made up their mind. Then you have my campaign, which is growing organically. We\u2019ve grown by, essentially, a percent a month over the last period. And that\u2019s without the benefit of any paid messaging or advertising.\nWe started advertising approximately three weeks ago. The lag time before advertising actually starts showing up in the polls is between three and six weeks. So you are likely to see our poll numbers rise. And more and more Americans are tuning in right now. We\u2019re going to grow and grow and peak at the right time. We think we can do well, particularly, in New Hampshire, upcoming, because it\u2019s an open primary and my campaign has a very strong appeal to independents, Libertarians and many, many disaffected Trump voters. I spoke to half a dozen Trump voters at my events in New Hampshire yesterday and they said that they are crossing party lines to support me.\nJW: Do you support ranked choice voting?\nYes. I have all these democracy reforms. So ranked choice voting, make Election Day a holiday, have vote by mail. I would lower the voting age to 16. Make every high school in the country a hotbed of political activity. Sixteen-year-olds can pay taxes, and they\u2019re going to be on this planet longer. They should have a say in where their taxes go.\nMr. Yang is the first presidential candidate to support lowering the voting age to 16. A recent poll found that 84 percent of Americans oppose the idea.\nKK: Michelle, do you have a \u2014\u2014\nMC: You\u2019ve got a week to make the next debate.\nI might have made it while we\u2019re sitting here.\nMC: It\u2019s true. I have not checked my phone. But if you don\u2019t, how do you work around this? Do you have a plan B? What do you do?\nI expect we\u2019re going to make the debate, but we\u2019ve been growing independent of the debate, I\u2019m happy to say. And for better or for worse, the influence of the debates seems to be waning along with the viewership. So we\u2019re going to be here the whole way, regardless. Our support base is independent of those appearances. But we\u2019re going to make the debate. I\u2019m going to continue to make my case to the American people. You\u2019re going to see us grow and grow, and peak at exactly Feb. 3.\nMr. Yang\u2019s support has indeed been growing in Iowa in recent months, with some polls finding him ahead of Pete Buttigieg.\nKK: For our last about minute, Brent, do you want to \u2014\u2014\nBS: What are you likely to fail at as president?\nI will fail at many things, I\u2019m sure. Keep in mind, I am married. So I understand my daily failures.\nBS: Your failing.\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned, even as a candidate, that I\u2019ve struggled with, truthfully, is that an entire organization hinges upon your day-to-day decisions or movements. And I know as president that will be amplified to a very, very high level.\nI like being a relatively normal citizen. I like being able to go to places and find things out and have normal conversations. I think that\u2019s going to be a real challenge for me because I\u2019ve seen, even now, people are more likely to tell you positive things or things you want to hear than the bad stuff. And so I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge for me to understand what\u2019s happening behind the smiling faces and the people that work for me and my administration.\nIt\u2019s going to be hard for me to get out to the American people because anytime you go out, you\u2019re going to be surrounded by a phalanx of press and staff and the rest of it. So I need to find ways to overcome that challenge.\nI\u2019m feeling it even now, because I am a layperson who decided to run for president, currently fifth in the polls, and that there\u2019ve been many transitions on a personal level. I think one of my primary qualifications to be president of the United States is that I actually do not socialize very easily. By that, what I mean is, I don\u2019t take myself that seriously. I don\u2019t stand on ceremony. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than anyone. And I think that\u2019s the kind of leader we need right now.\nBS: You\u2019ve made clear, at least in your early comments, that it\u2019s of primary importance for you to defeat Trump.\nYes.\nBS: At some point, you may decide that your chances of becoming nominee are diminishing. What could you do, outside of being a nominee, to help defeat Trump?\nThere are many of the candidates that I\u2019ve built a rapport with, I would be thrilled to campaign for. I believe I can help make sure that Donald Trump is a one-term president. Best as the nominee, but as someone campaigning for the nominee, I believe I could be very helpful there, too.\nKK: Would you support any Democratic candidate who ultimately won the nomination?\nYes, I would.\nKK: All right. Thank you very much for your time.\nThis interview was conducted Dec. 4, 2019, and published Jan. 15, 2020.

Mr. Buttigieg projected steadiness and thoroughness as he faced questions [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] about his consulting work at McKinsey & Company, his service in Afghanistan, his faith and his challenges in attracting support from minorities and younger voters, despite being the youngest candidate in the contest. He bristled at suggestions that his McKinsey work involved bread price fixing in Canada and claimed ignorance of the \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes popular on the internet among millennials. (\u201cI get the white part,\u201d he said.)\nHere is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 80-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d The Times\u2019s TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about \u201cThe Choice,\u201d and meet the editorial board members]\nWell, thanks for having me over.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Thank you for coming. So, we have heard you obviously talk about health care and climate and the Middle East a lot in the debates, so we\u2019re going to try to ask you some questions we haven\u2019t heard you answer in the past, and you will be shocked to hear that we\u2019d like to start with your time at McKinsey. You graduated from Oxford with sterling credentials. You could have pursued any number of career paths from there, including the choice you ultimately made to join the military. Can you walk us through why you decided to go to McKinsey from there?\nThe week of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s interview, he had just released his client list from his tenure at McKinsey. When he began his mayoral campaign in South Bend, he leaned heavily on his McKinsey credentials. In a campaign speech, he said: \u201cI am the only candidate with experience working on billion-dollar decisions, helping to turn around major companies around the country and around the world.\u201d\nYeah, so the biggest thing was that I had a great academic education, but I was beginning to feel that there wasn\u2019t as much real-world experience mixed in with it. That in particular, I was eager to do as many things as I could, touching as many fields as I could, and to understand business in particular, about how people and money and goods move around the world and how that works.\nKK: So you didn\u2019t just want to make a lot of money?\nA typical starting salary for analysts at McKinsey is now roughly $85,000 before annual bonuses.\nWhat\u2019s that?\nKK: You didn\u2019t just want to make a lot of money?\nI definitely noticed the paycheck and that was important, too. I needed to make a living. Yeah. I\u2019m not going to pretend that that wasn\u2019t on my mind, too.\nMr. Buttigieg said he lived off his savings from McKinsey during his first two runs for office.\nBinyamin Appelbaum: We\u2019d like to talk about some of those real-world experiences. So one of the companies you worked for, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, you said that you were analyzing costs there, and after you completed that project, the company moved ahead with hundreds of layoffs and rate increases. Did you understand that what you were doing as a McKinsey consultant at that company that you were working to prepare for layoffs and price increases?\nBlue Cross Blue Shield was Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s first assignment at McKinsey. He worked there for three months in 2007. After he left, the company cut as many as 1,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, according to The Times.\nI had nothing to do with premiums, prices, fees or anything like that. Mostly what my team was looking at was overhead. There\u2019s no way to know the relationship between analysis I did in 2007 and decisions they made in 2009, but certainly our focus was making sure that cost was under control there.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield announced its layoffs in January 2009, after the company reported a loss of about $140 million. The company also announced that it would freeze pay for nonunion workers and cut 25 percent of discretionary spending.\nBA: You surely understood why a company like that would hire McKinsey to come in. Yeah?\nHow do you mean?\nBA: When companies hire consultants, they\u2019re usually trying to reduce their costs, right?\nI think that\u2019s the only cost-cutting study I did out of all my time at McKinsey, so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s accurate to say that that\u2019s what most consulting work is.\nOne of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s McKinsey clients was the Postal Service, which called in McKinsey to address widening revenue losses. In a 2010 report, McKinsey recommended cost cutting by, among other things, replacing unionized career employees with a \u201cmore flexible\u201d work force. Read the report here.\nBA: So it surprised you when that resulted in layoffs and price increases cases. That didn\u2019t seem like what you would\u2019ve done if you had had that information.\nOver time, Mr. Buttigieg has distanced himself from the work he did at McKinsey. When he was running for Indiana state treasurer in 2010, it was a key part of his campaign pitch.\nI wasn\u2019t following news out of Michigan in 2009, so I found that out since, but yeah, I\u2019m not surprised. I mean, if an organization needs to cut costs, then that can involve layoffs.\nBA: Another of your clients, Loblaws, the grocery chain, has since said that it was involved in the price fixing of bread during the time that you were analyzing grocery prices for them. I\u2019m curious first, just, did you analyze the price of bread for them? Is that part of your agreement?\nIn December 2017, Loblaws admitted to participating in a more than 14-year-long scheme to inflate the price of packaged bread. The revelation came from a Competition Bureau criminal investigation into the country\u2019s bread price-fixing.\nNot in any detail. Basically the way my job worked was, they have about 50,000 items that they sold and I was creating and then crunching a database. What we would do is we would figure out, based on a year\u2019s worth of sales, if they tried to cut a certain percent off their prices across a certain number of hundreds of stores, what would the impact of that be? So, bread was probably one of the U.P.C. codes in there, but I didn\u2019t pay attention to one product over another.\nMr. Buttigieg was tasked with building an analysis that could help the company cut its prices without hurting the bottom line.\nBA: When you were working at McKinsey, did you understand the company\u2019s purpose to be exclusively maximizing its own profitability? Did you understand the purpose of the companies you worked for to be exclusively to maximize their profitability?\nWell, many of my clients as, you know, were public sector and nonprofits, so obviously their function is not about profitability. But yes, I worked for a company, a for-profit company.\nTwo-thirds of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s clients at McKinsey were nonprofit or public sector, including the Energy Foundation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Postal Service and the Department of Defense.\nBA: Do you think that that should be the sole mission of a corporation, though, to maximize profitability?\nWell, I think that there\u2019s something to be said for the dialogue that\u2019s happening with, for example, what\u2019s going on in the Business Roundtable, but also this is where policy needs to come in. We can\u2019t expect corporate America to spontaneously change what it is about, without imposing different kinds of left and right boundaries.\nIn August, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization that represents many of the country\u2019s largest companies, issued a statement redefining the purpose of a corporation. In addition to advancing the interests of shareholders, the group said, companies must also protect the environment, invest in employees and commit to ethical engagement with suppliers. Read the statement here.\nTo me, where the public sector and the function of regulation meets what private companies do is precisely to set up those kinds of boundaries. I welcome any time a company undertakes what is called corporate social responsibility, charitable activity or other factors in what they care about. I have been very interested to see the development of things like a B Corps, which has been a big conversation, especially around South Bend actually. Because one of the pioneering ones was a company called Better World Books that grew kind of up and around Notre Dame. But I also don\u2019t think we should be na\u00efve about how corporations behave unless they are regulated to ensure that their profit-seeking activities don\u2019t cause harm.\nB Corporations are companies certified for meeting high social, ethical and environmental standards. Better World Books, an online bookseller, became a founding B Corp in 2007. B Corps are certified by a nonprofit called B Lab. There are now more than 3,000 such businesses.\nKK: In your view, if a company engages in criminal conduct, are the employees responsible for that conduct?\nWell, obviously there\u2019s a whole theory in law about how liability works, but yeah, if somebody undertakes illegal behavior, they are as a general rule liable and should be.\nBA: But bring that down to the practical level then: If you\u2019re working for a consultant to a company that\u2019s engaged in a massive price-fixing scheme, what\u2019s your responsibility?\nWell, if you have anything to do with any wrongdoing, then you\u2019re responsible.\nBA: You have criticized some of McKinsey\u2019s more recent engagements with clients. Do you think that something fundamental has changed about the company since you left?\nIn December, ProPublica and The Times reported that McKinsey consultants had recommended in 2017 that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement cut spending on food and medical care for detained migrants. When asked about the reporting at a campaign event, Mr. Buttigieg said: \u201cThe decision to do what was reported yesterday in The Times is disgusting. And as somebody who left the firm a decade ago, seeing what certain people in that firm have decided to do is extremely frustrating and extremely disappointing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult from the outside looking in to gauge whether this reflects some kind of systemic shift or whether they just have a failure in terms of their guardrails. When I was there, there was a lot of talk about values. Firm values. Now, a lot of that was around impact and making sure that you put the client\u2019s interest first. There\u2019s one story that they were proud of that I remember was part of our training. Where they had gotten some big contract to help a large multinational move into China, and it was going to lead to tons of work. But in the initial analysis, while they were doing their first round of work, the conclusion they reached was that this company shouldn\u2019t go to China at all. So, the story, at least the story as it was told within the firm, was that they gave the right advice, even though it cost them, right? So, you would hear a lot about a certain kind of ethic, but it was always about putting the client\u2019s interest first.\nMcKinsey\u2019s work with Chinese state-owned companies has recently come under fire. The firm has advised at least 22 of the 100 largest state-owned companies in China. Times reporting revealed that one of McKinsey\u2019s Chinese clients helped build China\u2019s artificial islands in the South China Sea. This was after Mr. Buttigieg left the firm. Read The Times report here.\nWhat you didn\u2019t hear as much was about whether what the client was doing had moral consequences that the firm didn\u2019t want to touch. I believe I remember a decision not to serve tobacco had been made by the time I was there. But my point is, there seems to be a problem there with assessing what they want to be associated with. Definitely with the ICE work, with the Saudi work, where you just say, this is a company that\u2019s good at helping clients meet objectives. But some of those objectives are not something we want anything to do with, and I think they need to step back and reassess what kind of client work they should take on in the first place.\nMcKinsey worked with the Saudi Arabian government to analyze public opinion on the monarchy\u2019s most important policies. The firm singled out three people who drove anti-government conversation on Twitter; one was subsequently arrested.\nKK: So you have portrayed a lot of the work that you did for McKinsey, like many analysts and junior staffers starting out in consulting, as mainly crunching data and making PowerPoint presentations and shuffling paper, more or less. Of course, there are also junior consultants and contractors who go to do government work, like Edward Snowden and Reality Winner, who see something that they think is wrong and decide to speak up. Can you tell us your opinion of Mr. Snowden and Ms. Winner\u2019s actions?\nMr. Snowden is a former subcontractor with the National Security Agency who leaked information about the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance activities in 2013. Reality Winner is a former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who leaked a government report about Russian hacking. She was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison, the longest sentence ever imposed for leaking government information to the media.\nWell, I think that we ought to have whistle-blower protections so that folks like that are not forced to choose between maintaining classified information and speaking up about wrongdoing. It may well be the case that we\u2019re seeing the whistle-blower concept work in the way in which the current Ukraine process and investigation came about.\nKK: So you think of Edward Snowden as a whistle-blower?\nUnder President Obama, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Mr. Snowden \u201cis not a whistle-blower\u201d because he did not follow established protocol for releasing confidential information.\nNot necessarily. I think he could have been, if that framework existed. Instead I think of him as somebody who divulged classified information.\nKK: O.K. By some estimates, the federal government\u2019s work force is between 40 and 70 percent made up of contractors. What do you think of that ratio? What should it be ideally?\nA 2017 report from New York University professor Paul Light estimated that four out of every 10 people who work for the U.S. government are private contractors, about 3.7 million people.\nI think it\u2019d be arbitrary to just say there\u2019s some number that should be contractors. What I think we need to do, across our economy, and in some ways the federal government reflects this, is remove some of the magic between being an employee and being a contractor. So I think the biggest example we\u2019re seeing of this in the new economy is, of course, with the gig economy, right?\nThe Times editorial board has condemned the labor practices of companies like Google that rely heavily on contractors because they do not have to offer their contractors the same benefits afforded full-time workers. Read the editorial here.\nThis idea that you can drive for Uber and somehow not be a worker because you are contractor. A lot of this is about getting around labor standards. A lot of this is about cost-saving. Now, if we had a benefit structure in this country that was not only portable but also prorated, then we would be able to remove some of the magic that creates an incentive to have people be contractors rather than employees, and some of the incentives to be a part-time employer versus a full-time employer as well, for people who are employees on the books.\nIn September, California\u2019s State Assembly passed a bill narrowing the definition of who can be classified as a contractor rather than employee. Uber responded by saying its drivers are contractors because transportation isn\u2019t the company\u2019s primary business. Read the Times editorial \u201cTake That \u2018Gig\u2019 and Shove It,\u201d here.\nThere will always be times, certainly in my administration, there\u2019ve been times when I\u2019ve turned, in particular, to law firms to supplement the work that our in-house legal team could do and other consultants with specialized expertise or some area where it just made more sense. Of course that\u2019s the case in the federal government too. But if it\u2019s just a way to get around the obligations of having an employee, then I think it needs to be reassessed and the more that can be brought in house, the better. I guess what I\u2019m saying is we can make some changes in our economy and our benefits systems that would reduce some of the pressure to do that in the first place.\nKK: This is just a yes or no question, but would you advise a senior at Harvard today to go to work at McKinsey?\nDepends on the senior. I mean I get questions from people who are thinking about joining the military, as well as consulting companies, as well as political campaigns. I\u2019ll tell you when I was a senior at Harvard, they came around then, too. The standard that I had for myself was, your early 20s are such a precious time that you should prioritize what you\u2019re going to get out of your experience, way more than anything a paycheck can offer you in your early 20s and, for me, it didn\u2019t meet that standard when I was leaving college.\nDirectly out of college, in 2005, Mr. Buttigieg went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship.\nKK: O.K. We\u2019re going to pivot to a new topic if you don\u2019t mind.\nMara Gay: Mr. Mayor, can you explain the mistakes that were made around your Douglass Plan? Why did your campaign falsely claim support from black leaders and then use tokenizing stock photos? Can you just talk about how that happened?\nIn July, the Buttigieg campaign released \u201cThe Douglass Plan: A Comprehensive Investment in the Empowerment of Black America.\u201d The campaign released a list of 400 South Carolinians who supported the plan but faced blowback when some said the campaign was intentionally vague about whether they were endorsing the plan or the mayor\u2019s candidacy. The plan was also criticized for featuring a stock photo of a Kenyan woman, who later reached out to The Intercept to voice confusion about her inclusion. Read the Intercept\u2019s reporting on this here.\nMy understanding is that no false statement has ever been made about somebody\u2019s support for the plan. My understanding is that there were miscommunications about the public rollout of people\u2019s names, all of whom had indicated at some point support for the plan, but not all of whom had reconfirmed that they were up for \u2014\u2014\nThe Buttigieg campaign said it sent the plan to a list of South Carolinians and told them they could opt out if they didn\u2019t want to appear on the supporter list. Johnnie Cordero, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party\u2019s Black Caucus, was listed as a supporter, but his name no longer appears on it and he said he did not endorse the Douglass Plan nor Mr. Buttigieg.\nMG: Right. They called it misleading.\n\u2014\u2014 having their names attached to that. So that was a process mistake, obviously, that led to changes in how we communicate with supporters and people that we\u2019re in dialogue with about our policies. I don\u2019t know as much about the stock photo. I think it was on the website until September. I know that the vendor who was involved in running that part of the website or adding that kind of imagery has not been with the campaign for a while and obviously that was a mistake.\nThe stock photo was removed from the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s website in September.\nMG: How can you win the Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency, without the support of black voters? What do you make of the lack of support for your campaign from that community so far?\nBlack voters will make up about 25 percent of voters in the Democratic primaries, according to FiveThirtyEight and NBC. They will be a majority in Alabama and Mississippi. A recent Economist/YouGov survey put Mr. Buttigieg at 2 percent among black voters.\nWell, I believe, first of all, that we\u2019re earning support from black voters. I became mayor and was re-elected as mayor, largely because of support from every constituency, including the black community in my city. I believe that it is \u2014\u2014\nPolitico analyzed data from the 2011 and 2015 mayoral elections in South Bend and found that Mr. Buttigieg won the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, but he lagged when facing black primary challengers. Read the analysis here.\nBrent Staples: What\u2019s the percentage of black citizenship there?\nAbout 25 percent. I carried every district, including the minority-majority districts in our city, in primaries and generals, both times. I believe that anyone who proposes to be the president ought to be a president for everybody and also in particular, given what African-Americans are up against in the United States today, that the message of the Democratic Party needs to be one that speaks to black voters where they are. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re being very intentional about that.\nCensus data indicates that about a quarter of South Bend\u2019s population is black. Politico\u2019s analysis found that Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s support from the black community declined between his first and second runs for mayor.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to plunge in on polling numbers, but the last couple of rounds that came back suggested that the way that I\u2019m viewed among black voters is roughly the same in terms of the proportions as among white voters. But far more black voters say they don\u2019t know me or don\u2019t have an opinion. I think part of this reflects the fact, certainly something I hear from a lot of black voters, that folks feel not only abused by the Republican Party but often taken for granted by the Democratic Party. So the trust that you can build through quantity of time, through longevity, is very important. I don\u2019t have the kind of longevity that obviously some of my competitors \u2014\u2014\nMG: So how do you overcome that?\nSo two things. First of all, the substance of what we have to offer. I\u2019m really proud of what\u2019s in the Douglass Plan. It\u2019s praised as the most comprehensive plan on dealing with systemic inequality put forward by a presidential candidate. Not, of course, because I sat in a room and thought up all these brilliant ideas, but because we had a lot of conversation and a lot of dialogue and fit our values to a plan to move forward. The more I communicate that plan, the better received it is and the better received I am.\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s Douglass Plan, named for the abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, aims to reduce the country\u2019s prison population by 50 percent, address maternal mortality in the black community and increase funding for historically black colleges and universities among many other aims.\nBut I also think before a lot of folks care what\u2019s in your plan, they need to know what\u2019s in your heart. And I\u2019m working in not just traditional campaign formats \u2014 big speeches and TV appearances \u2014 but also we\u2019ve been doing more and more quiet and smaller engagements.\nOur recent tour to the South, for example, had a lot of conversations that were between 20 and 50 people. Some of them very targeted around a policy issue like health equity or minority entrepreneurship. Some of it more about making sure that I was speaking to and hearing from folks who had been overlooked. So when we were in South Carolina, for example, we were with an almost all-black Democratic group in Allendale County. This is early presidential primary state, right? They hadn\u2019t seen a presidential candidate in more than a decade, and you could feel the extent to which they felt overlooked. Those kinds of engagements I think are very important, too. It\u2019s not just about obviously, our goal to win, it\u2019s about deserving to win. I think that kind of dialogue coupled with all of the things that you do in traditional campaigning is really important right now.\nMG: Your plans for tackling income inequality are not quite as detailed as some of the other candidates\u2019. For example, your policies on an inclusive economy say somewhat vaguely that you\u2019re going to knock down unfair barriers to entrepreneurship. What would that look like?\nA key feature of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s plan for an inclusive economy is his Walker-Lewis Initiative, which aims to triple the number of entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities in the next decade.\nSure. So first of all, we know that there are challenges to access to credit. In fact, virtually every small African-American-owned business that I\u2019ve visited in this campaign, I ask, how\u2019d you get started? How\u2019d you get your start-up money? They always say they had to come up with the cash. That\u2019s a pattern of course that\u2019s borne out on everything from how mom-and-pop businesses experience commercial banking to the well-documented fact of V.C. [venture capital] money, almost all going to a small handful of people and kinds of people in a certain number of places.\nBlack families on average have one-tenth the wealth of white families; a key factor is that black, Hispanic and young people are more likely to be denied credit.\nSo there are things we can do about that. One thing we can do is capitalize CDFIs better \u2014 Community Development Financial Institutions \u2014 that have a much better track record of in turn supporting minority entrepreneurship. The way I would do it would be a 5X C.R.A. super credit for any of the larger institutions to flow funds into CDFIs.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions are private institutions created to provide financial services in underserved communities, particularly low-income people. They include Community Development Banks, Community Development Credit Unions, Community Development Loan Funds and Community Development Venture Capital Funds.\nAnother thing we can do is direct co-investment \u2014 this is part of our Walker-Lewis Initiative \u2014 in businesses led by those who are underrepresented. There\u2019s precedent for this with TEDCO in Maryland, and I think that kind of co-investment could be very powerful. We\u2019ve seen it in other countries \u2014 you actually see it in the Israeli start-up community with state-supported grants.\nPart of it is looking at other things that need to be reformed in credit scoring and credit systems generally, and then part of it is a little deeper in the chain of cause and effect, right? Where we know how much of the wealth in this country is inherited, not just among the ultrawealthy but just in general.\nKK: Sure.\nAnd how that flows through the implications for homeownership and access to education and health and all the other things that become barriers to folks being able to be empowered economically as they grow up.\nKK: Who do you consider to be your most important advisers within the African-American communities, but also communities of color in general?\nWell, first of all, our campaign team, we were about \u2014 overall, I think we\u2019re about 40 percent people of color.\nAt an N.A.A.C.P. forum in Detroit last summer, Mr. Buttigieg was questioned on the inadequate racial diversity of his \u201ctop-tier staff\u201d on the campaign. The Intercept reported that of nine top city department heads in South Bend, seven are white. Of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s six executive staff members in South Bend just two were nonwhite.\nI will turn to anybody from the local organizer in a given county that we\u2019re traveling to in South Carolina to senior figures like Brandon Neal, our senior adviser on the campaign who\u2019s got a great track record from the Obama White House and the N.A.A.C.P. Or folks like our national investment chair, Swati Mylavarapu, who can speak a lot to some of those capital-formation issues. We try to make sure that I\u2019m listening to everybody I can learn from. I don\u2019t always start by getting permission for whether I can name check them, but a lot of conversation going on.\nBrandon Neal previously served as the national political director at the Democratic National Committee. He also worked for the N.A.A.C.P. and the 2008 Obama campaign. Swati Mylavarapu is a former Silicon Valley tech executive and investor.\nMG: Sorry. Just real quick, have you been to the museum in Montgomery?\nMs. Gay is referring to the Equal Justice Initiative\u2019s Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, sites dedicated to victims of white supremacy and especially lynching. Mr. Staples wrote an editorial observer on the museum and memorial here, and Mr. Wegman wrote one here.\nI have. Yeah. Very recently, and it is haunting because it evokes things that I\u2019ve seen in places like Cambodia, and it\u2019s on American soil. The way they\u2019ve constructed it is, I think, it forces you to understand the relationship between past, present and future. That\u2019s, of course, all the brilliant work that Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative are doing. The fact that it arose out of activism on the death penalty, for example, in Alabama, a state that does not offer counsel past trial and, I think, maybe first appeal for the indigent even on death row, shows you that this is not just about marking something that happened. This is about connecting all of the patterns of injustice and surfacing the violent nature of that injustice in a way that forces us to contend with how it\u2019s all connected.\nMr. Stevenson, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, was inspired to push for the creation of the memorial by criminal justice reform work he was doing in Alabama. The museum has an exhibit about Anthony Ray Hinton, who was wrongfully convicted by an all-white jury and spent 28 years on death row.\nBS: The death penalty as we know it evolved out of lynching.\nYes, as we know it, for sure. Which is, by the way, part of why I\u2019m calling for a constitutional amendment to end the death penalty. Anyway, it was a very powerful experience, and I think it\u2019s very important for us to view not as an antiquarian kind of thing, but as a touchstone for what we\u2019ve got to deal with right now.\nThis is included in Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s Douglass Plan.\nMG: Thanks.\nAisha Harris: Mr. Mayor, you recently said that the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump. Where does Obama fit into all of that? Because he was in office for eight years. I know you were misquoted at one point on that part.\nAt a rally in November, Mr. Buttigieg said: \u201cI think the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump. I am much more interested in building a future that is going to have a lot of differences.\u201d The L.A. Times initially wrongly quoted him as saying \u201cthe failures of the Obama era.\u201d\nYou noticed.\nAH: Yes, but Obama was in office for eight years. So where does he fit into the old normal as you see it?\nWell, first of all, let\u2019s acknowledge that under President Obama, the Great Depression was avoided. Osama bin Laden was brought to justice. Health care was extended to millions of Americans. The auto industry was, was rescued in our country, is pretty good for eight years work. I also think that \u2014\u2014\nBS: That\u2019s the other thing that \u2014 sorry to interrupt you. The other thing to that is the number of racist hate groups kind of quintupled under his leadership. I mean the mere fact of a black person in the White House brought that about.\nIn February 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that the number of hate groups had grown for the fourth consecutive year. Before that, there were three consecutive years of decline under President Obama.\nWhich is why we can\u2019t treat the Trump phenomenon as a blip or an anomaly. I mean this is surfacing things that \u2014 as in a different way, the arrival of the first African-American president surfaced things that \u2014 of course, had been here all along.\nWe\u2019re going to have to reckon with the extent to which Trump and Trumpism reflect a lot more about America than we might want to admit. Now, he was also, I think, capitalizing on a wave of populism that was responsive to what I would call a 40-year-long Reagan era that President Obama was the last Democratic president serving within. In other words, he was constrained by an atmosphere, a neoliberal consensus, where even for Democrats, most of the time, the only thing you could ever say you were going to do to a tax was cut it. There was this set of constraints that has dominated our political conversation leading to the conflagration that is Trump and Trumpism, and we\u2019ve got to find our way out of it to something new.\nIt is widely argued that the 1970s ushered in a new era of neoliberalism, whose economic and social policies put capitalism and free market competition at its core.\nAH: So how do you plan to sort of dismantle that old regime? Because in part, one of the issues that I think a lot of especially young people have is that you don\u2019t seem nearly as progressive or as revolutionary in some ways as some of the other candidates. That\u2019s something a lot of young people are looking for. So how do you \u2014 can you explain in a little bit more detail how you think about that?\nYeah. Sure. First of all, what I\u2019m proposing would make me the most progressive president in the lifetimes, not only of young people, but I mean, certainly in the last half century. I\u2019ll also say that it matters that we hold together an American majority that is progressive enough that it unlocks possibilities that were not available even 10 years ago during the Obama presidency. So it took everything that the Democratic Party had just to push through a health care reform in the A.C.A., invented by conservatives. Right? And that was a major achievement.\nThe central features of the Affordable Care Act were modeled by Gov. Mitt Romney in Massachusetts and advanced by economists at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. Read the Heritage speech here.\nBut that was as far as you could get during the constraints of that time. Where we are right now is that there is a powerfully large, not everybody obviously, but a powerfully large American majority. Not only to do the right thing on areas where Democrats have generally been trusted \u2014 wages, labor, health \u2014 but also areas where we\u2019ve been on defense, like immigration, guns.\nHolding that majority together is a big part of the task of the next president. I\u2019m not just talking about how to win an election. I\u2019m talking about how to govern this country. We need to have enough clarity of vision that we can see that the boldness of an idea is not measured only by how many people it can alienate, but by what it can get done. So there\u2019s always a more extreme solution on offer that sometimes I\u2019ll be competing with. But I also want to be very clear that what I\u2019m talking about would make the next era \u2014 what I\u2019m proposing we do would make the next era very different from the one we\u2019ve been living.\nAH: Well, one \u2014\u2014\nThat\u2019s my concern is to make that happen.\nAH: So one final question. How do you convey that to younger voters? How do you counter the \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes? Are you familiar?\nThe \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes feature Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s supporters dancing to Panic! at the Disco\u2019s \u201cHigh Hopes\"; the \u201cmayo\u201d name plays on the idea that, as Mel Magazine explains, Mr. Buttigieg is seen by some as \u201cbland and overwhelmingly white.\u201d\nI\u2019m not. Do I want to know?\nBS: You haven\u2019t heard that expression?\nAH: Well, mayonnaise as I think, and a lot of people think is really, really gross and there have been teens \u2014\u2014\nBS: Wait a minute. [LAUGHTER]\nAH: Let\u2019s not get off track.\nBS: Wait a minute!\nAH: Anyway, people feel strongly about mayo. There have been younger people \u2014 there\u2019s a meme going around called \u201cMayo Pete,\u201d and that I think does speak a little bit to the lack of youth support that you currently hold, even compared to those who are significantly older.\nA New York Times/Siena College poll in November found that young voters ranked Mr. Buttigieg as their third choice, behind Senators Warren and Sanders.\nKK: A more generous interpretation is it\u2019s bland.\nPB: O.K.\nJohn Broder: White.\nSeveral others: And white. [LAUGHTER]\nI get the white part.\nAH: I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you\u2019re gross. [LAUGHTER] That\u2019s not what I meant.\nWell, first of all \u2014 again, try to get folks to look at how big these ideas are. I mean I\u2019m talking to them about the biggest reform in the American health care system we\u2019ve had since Medicare was invented. I\u2019m talking about a game-changing transformation on the availability of funds to go to college. I\u2019m talking about getting our climate carbon neutral by 2050.\nThat will test the limits of human capacity, and there will always be some folks who say, it\u2019s not real. Health care reform isn\u2019t real unless you obliterate the entire private industry. College isn\u2019t real unless even the child of a billionaire can go without paying a penny in tuition. The climate change thing doesn\u2019t count unless it\u2019s trillions more dollars than it is, and that\u2019s just not how I measured the bigness of an idea.\nBA: If I can put this question in a slightly different way, you\u2019ve been on the front lines of corporate downsizing. You\u2019ve been on the front lines of corporate price fixing.\nWhoa, whoa whoa, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014\u2014\nBA: You\u2019ve been on the front of our misadventures in foreign policy. You\u2019ve had direct experience in many of the things that make a lot of young people very angry about the way that this country is operating right now. You don\u2019t seem to embody that anger.\nIn 2003, Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 then a junior at Harvard \u2014 spoke at an antiwar rally in Cambridge, Mass., protesting the invasion of Iraq. More than a decade later, in 2014, he served seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserves.\nSo the proposition that I\u2019ve been on front lines of corporate price fixing is bullshit. Just to get that out of the way.\nBA: You worked for a company that was fixing bread prices.\nNo, I worked for a consulting company that had a client that may have been involved in fixing or was apparently in a scandal. I was not aware of the Canadian bread pricing scandal until last night.\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has maintained that he only recently heard of the bread price-fixing scheme and while he was working with Loblaws focused on price cuts more broadly across the grocery store chain.\nBA: Do you feel the anger that many young people feel about the state of \u2014\u2014\nYeah, of course, because it destroyed my city. I grew up surrounded by crumbling factories and empty houses. My city lost 30,000 of its 130,000 people, largely before I was born. So I\u2019m under no illusions about the problems that are present in American capitalism generally and were unleashed beginning with the Reagan era specifically. And while I may not be as emotive sometimes about my sense of anger or frustration or injustice \u2014 and I would argue that some people are given more room to be emotive than others \u2014 I would not be doing any of this if I were not propelled by a level of passion.\nSouth Bend had an unemployment rate of 13 percent in 2010. Under Mayor Buttigieg, it fell to 3.2 percent, though it rose back to 4.3 percent in 2018.\nLook, let\u2019s talk about why I walked away from the private sector in order to go to Indiana to run as a statewide Democratic candidate during the Tea Party wave of 2010 on a platform of defending Barack Obama\u2019s economic policy, knowing that I would in all likelihood get my ass handed to me, which is what happened. But recognizing that the treatment of autoworkers by our incumbent state treasurer in a dispute \u2014 which very few people followed, but really fired me up \u2014 showed everything that was wrong about the way that our politicians, our corporations, our workers and our communities were interacting. And even though I didn\u2019t win, as expected, I also never regretted the fact that even though I spent down all of my savings doing it with an income of, I think, 450 bucks a month from the Navy being what I had during that year.\nMr. Buttigieg ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and lost to Republican Richard Mourdock by nearly 25 percentage points. Mr. Mourdock was a Tea Party Republican.\nKK: So much for those McKinsey dollars, right?\nWell, I spent them all, right? I saved them up, and then I spent them all. This is one of the reasons why I\u2019m, by far, the least wealthy person running for president right now. I guess my point is my decision to take on that fight and subsequently my decision to serve my hometown at the time that it was written off as dying. Having burned through my lavish McKinsey savings and now going into credit card debt was propelled by my acute awareness of the things that are wrong.\nForbes estimates that Mr. Buttigieg is the least wealthy candidate in the 2020 Democratic field.\nBS: When you say you \u2014 just a little aside there, some people are given latitude to be more emotive than others. What are you talking about?\nI just think that \u2014 you are sometimes asked to \u2014\u2014\nBS: You being Pete.\nYeah, sure. I am sometimes asked to be more, I don\u2019t know, have more of a flourish in displaying my emotions, and it is precisely because I feel very strongly about lots of things that I have learned to master how I might feel about anything and channel that into action. Now, I still take great pleasure in firing up a crowd that agrees with me on something I\u2019m passionate about. But I\u2019m also mindful as the new guy that maybe waving my arms is not the best way to convey what I care about.\nJesse Wegman: But who\u2019s given more room to be emotive than you?\nHmm?\nJW: Who is given more room to be emotive than you are?\nOthers. [LAUGHTER]\nNick Fox: Let me get back to Aisha\u2019s question for \u2014\u2014\nMichelle Cottle: You\u2019re looking to distinguish yourself within a sprawling field of candidates. What do you see as real advantages or challenges as being the first openly gay candidate for a major party?\nAs recently as 2007, just 55 percent of voters said they would support a gay or lesbian candidate according to FiveThirtyEight.\nBS: And I have a related question to that, kind of piggy back on it. You\u2019ve talked about your decision not to come out over some period of your life, and I believe we recorded you in a story of saying at some point you thought that coming out would be a political death, a career death sentence. Could you just recap again why you decided to come out when you did, and if you feel you\u2019ve handled that in a way \u2014 what emotional residue is left over from that? You feel you hid too long? Or do you \u2014 what\u2019s the residual of that previous hidden life?\nYou can Read \u201cPete Buttigieg\u2019s Life in the Closet\u201d by Jeremy Peters in The Times here.\nWell, between the time I figured out I was gay and the time I came out, was a period of consciously avoiding love, and that has a certain cost, it has a certain weight. On the other hand, I was also very busy in a very meaningful and very fulfilling job, certainly during my time as mayor. So, I\u2019m not sure I felt the cost as keenly as I would have if I were working 40 hours a week or if I had a job that didn\u2019t give me as much meaning, which I think numbed me a little bit to the effect.\nWhat put me over the edge was the experience of the deployment, where you have that experience where you write the letter, and you put it where your folks can find it if you don\u2019t come back. And I remember writing words that I really meant about how I did not want anyone to think, if my life were short, that I had been cheated because I\u2019d had such a full and wonderful life, even at a young age. But also, knowing that I was preparing for the risk of dying at an age where most of my peers had something I didn\u2019t, which is to know what it was like to be in love. And that was untenable.\nThe Times\u2019s podcast \u201cThe Daily\u201d has an episode focused on Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s decision to come out, featured in its series of interviews with candidates on pivotal moments in their lives. Listen here.\nSo, by the time I came back, I knew I had to do it, but there was the question of how. Right? By then \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was over, so it didn\u2019t mean ending my military career. There was every indication it might mean ending my political career. And I reached the conclusion that I had to take that risk, that was O.K., but also, I had some measure of faith in my community, that at least my current job might be something that I could earn another shot at based on the work I did.\nBut as somebody who lives in Indiana, and needless to say, as somebody who was not computing the possibility of running for president in 2020 when I was going through these personal deliberations in 2015, I recognized that it might constrain, not to say end, a political future I would have in Indiana. As to what it means big picture, I\u2019ll tell you. A couple of things that it means right now, which are very powerful, which is young people letting me know that I\u2019m helping them in some way just by doing this. And not even just young queer people, the really exciting thing \u2014 I\u2019ve shared this story many times on the trail \u2014 was when a teenager let me know that my campaign helped her feel like she had a sense of belonging in her school and her environment even though she had autism. So, that idea of representing difference in a way that validates others.\nMC: This makes you less mayo.\nMaybe. Hopefully it\u2019s at least a better flavor. I don\u2019t know.\nKK: No longer gross.\nBS: Basil mayo.\nI actually hate flavored mayo \u2014 they do this avocado stuff now and it \u2014 because I only use mayo when I\u2019m making tuna salad. [LAUGHTER] And I want it as straightforward as possible.\nBS: That\u2019s a joke?\nPB: No, it\u2019s high-protein. It\u2019s very affordable.\nBS: O.K. I thought you\u2019re making a joke.\nYou can put it on toast. Anyway, where was I? Yeah. Sorry. [LAUGHTER] So, then you have older folks who, and it\u2019s not unusual \u2014 I would say every rope line, well maybe not every rope line, but often, somebody comes up to me, looks at me, starts to try to say something and can\u2019t. They\u2019re usually in their 50s or older, and I know exactly what they\u2019re saying and that\u2019s all it takes. And that is extraordinary.\nIt\u2019s not why I got into this race, but it\u2019s part of what this campaign means, and I\u2019m very mindful of that. I\u2019m also very mindful from a historic perspective that usually when somebody had \u2014 well, we don\u2019t have nearly enough examples, but when somebody\u2019s broken a barrier going into the presidency, it\u2019s usually not been the first person to make the attempt. So, the first woman president will not be the first woman to run for president. The first African-American president was not the first African-American to run for president. So, analytically, I\u2019m conscious of the fact that I seek the presidency, if elected, I\u2019d be the first out gay president, and I\u2019m the first elected official to make the attempt.\nThe first woman to run for president is often credited as Victoria Woodhull, a stockbroker and newspaper publisher who ran in 1872. The first African-American to run for president was George Edwin Taylor in 1904. The son of a slave, Mr. Taylor ran as the candidate of the National Negro Liberty Party.\nMC: Do you feel a burden of representation? A lot of women have talked about whether or not they feel this extra burden when they are representing, or minorities or things like that. I mean, is this something that you contend with?\nWell, I don\u2019t want to sit around thinking about it, but it\u2019s certainly there. Sure, yeah, of course, but so is every \u2014 look, when you put your name on the ballot, and you\u2019ve got organizers who attach their name to yours and drop what they\u2019re doing and skip college to go to Iowa and help you, and people give you their money for your campaign, and some of them tell you that they\u2019re passing up a vacation so that they can contribute to your campaign. You already feel that level of responsibility. Right? So, calling it a burden \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one more reason I\u2019m motivated to make sure that I do the very best to win and to deserve to win.\nMC: Now, have you given thought, and I know it\u2019s early, but if not to specific running mates then to factors of what you\u2019d be looking for? We talked to people about balancing the tickets.\nYeah.\nMC: Things like that.\nSo, first of all, the choice of a running mate is the one choice a candidate makes that is actually a presidential choice. The whole country has to live with it. And so, in a way, retroactively, it\u2019s your first decision as president. And for that reason I think you have to have this deadly serious bar that it\u2019s really about who is best positioned to lead the country in the event that I get killed or I\u2019m unable to serve, and everything else has to follow that.\nHaving said that, whether we\u2019re talking about running mates or whether we\u2019re talking about my vision for how to build out a cabinet, yes, balance is extremely important. Racial balance, gender balance, balance in experience, having a shared worldview but different strengths and weaknesses is important. And so, I\u2019ve made a decision that I should not say anything that would disqualify anybody from being considered, but in addition to balance and diversity and range \u2014 this, by the way, another reason I pledged the 50 percent women minimum cabinet. I\u2019m looking for truth tellers because I\u2019ve always relied on those I\u2019m with and certainly in my administration, also in my campaign, to be there to tell me things I wish weren\u2019t true or would rather not hear. And that quality, I imagine this is especially important in a vice president, not to mention a running mate.\nIn Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s agenda promoting women\u2019s rights, he committed to nominating women to 50 percent of his cabinet positions and judicial seats. He also said he would put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill and create a commission to ensure there are more national monuments for women.\nMC: Now, looking at one more with a campaign, specifically, and it speaks a little bit to the youth questions and whether or not you\u2019re not quite revolutionary enough. Cleaning up the campaign finance system is a big issue for Democrats. They won big on it with the midterms. Are you concerned that your broader approach to campaign donations, not eschewing big corporate donations and things like that, will alienate you from these younger, more idealistic voters who really see money in politics, big money in politics, as a problem?\nAfter the board\u2019s interview with Mr. Buttigieg, he came under fire for a photo that went viral of a fund-raiser held for his campaign at a \u201cwine cave\u201d in California.\nI see money in politics as a problem, but it\u2019s a structural problem requiring a structural fix. I mean, we are getting ready to go into the fight of our lives against Donald Trump and his allies, that last time I checked, put together something like 125 million bucks in the last quarter. Right? And tying a hand behind our back to satisfy a purity test is not going to help us deliver the actual structural change that\u2019s needed. So, I don\u2019t take corporate PAC money because I think it\u2019s important to live that ideal. I also have 700,000, I think, individual contributors, and I obviously don\u2019t know most of them personally. Right? And I imagine they don\u2019t agree with me on everything, they don\u2019t agree with each other on everything, but I certainly believe in grass roots organization building. And the office of mayor of South Bend, Ind., is not generally known as an establishment fund-raising powerhouse. Right? So, we got to where we are with a message and a vision that\u2019s compelling, and my message, whether it\u2019s to young progressives or to moderates or to the future former Republicans I\u2019m finding out there on the trail is, \u201cLook at what we could do as a country.\u201d And if that message is compelling, I have to believe that\u2019s what will decide this election.\nSenators Warren and Sanders are refusing high-dollar private fund-raisers \u2014 which Mr. Buttigieg refers to as a \u201cpurity test.\u201d\nKK: We\u2019re about halfway through our time at this point. We have about four more pages of questions here, so we\u2019re going to turn to another topic.\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Mayor, I wanted to ask you a little bit about reproductive rights. When you\u2019ve talked about your support for abortion rights, you\u2019ve in the past said that you\u2019ve taken cues from the Bible. I\u2019m curious how you connect with both voters and lawmakers who have a very different interpretation from the Bible, that abortion is a sin or even akin to murder, or do you even try to change their minds or reach them?\nIn a radio interview last September, Mr. Buttigieg said the Bible has guided his views on reproductive rights. He said, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.\u201d\nFirst of all, my interpretation of my religion has no business being imposed on anyone else through policy. So, I\u2019ve occasionally shared my own understanding of the verses beginning with Genesis about the breath of life, that associate the beginning of life with breath, but that is a personal encounter with scripture that is not for anybody else to have to live with from a policy perspective.\nLK: O.K.\nI think that different people reach different good-faith conclusions about when life begins, which is a metaphysical and, in certain ways, unknowable question. Which is exactly why I think the consensus, or at least the decision we\u2019ve got to reach, is not to convince one another to draw the same line in the same place, but to reach a decision, or consensus, about who gets to draw the line. Not where to draw the line, but who should run the line.\nTimes columnist Ross Douthat responded to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s comments on biblical verse and reproductive freedom here.\nLK: So, I appreciate that you take your biblical interpretation out of the policy arena, but that\u2019s certainly not true of the other side. Right?\nTrue. Yeah, yeah. And this is the problem, right? This is the problem with certain versions of how some people want to bring religion into politics, which is not just as a formation of conscience. I think we have an obligation to be transparent about how our conscience is formed, but something that they believe others ought to have to live by. And obviously, as a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, I\u2019ve seen the consequences of other people believing their interpretation of their religion ought to be imposed on me. And we see something similar in the fight against abortion rights.\nJim Dao: Who does get to draw the line? How do you define that?\nWell, in my view, it\u2019s the woman facing the decision. Now, societally, we do have some broad boundaries. You look at the Roe v. Wade framework that has early in pregnancy, very few restrictions, and late in pregnancy, very few exceptions. So, at the broadest level, there\u2019s some societal and legal norms, but we view this, ultimately, as an individual choice. And this is another example of something that most Americans believe. You wouldn\u2019t know it.\nLK: Yeah. Most of Americans believe it, but that framework that you\u2019re talking about, Roe, is being chipped away at.\nIn 2019, a number of states passed laws posing a serious threat to women\u2019s reproductive freedoms, from Alabama\u2019s restrictive abortion bill to Georgia\u2019s so-called heartbeat bill.\nExactly. Yeah, yeah. And it\u2019s being chipped away in a way that is counter \u2014 my point is that it\u2019s counter to what most Americans believe. And it will continue on all fronts, executive, judicial and legislative, which is why I\u2019m determined to make sure my appointments to the judiciary share my understanding of freedom. My executive actions \u2014 some of which can be done right away, think about the Title X gag rule. Right?\nIn \u201cThe G.O.P.\u2019s War on Women\u2019s Health Gets Results,\u201d the editorial board wrote about how the Trump administration has undermined Title X, making it hard for women\u2019s health clinics to stay open. Read the editorial here.\nLK: Sure. Yes.\nUphold the right to choose. But also, that we put more legislative backing behind things like the need to encode Roe, and the need to withdraw things like the Hyde Amendment, that are de facto restrictions that make it impossible to access abortion care for those who are low income.\nJW: Mr. Mayor, speaking of your judicial appointments and cases like Roe v. Wade, can you give us some names of people you\u2019d consider nominating to the Supreme Court?\nSo, again, I think it\u2019s irresponsible for me to name check folks for the future.\nJW: Donald Trump did it.\nPresident Trump put out a list of possible Supreme Court picks in May 2016, and added more names in September. View the list here.\nAnd he is not my role model on things like this.\nJW: But it helped him.\nI\u2019m sure it did. Lots of things he did helped him that I will not be emulating. I can tell you that there are justices, I mean folks like \u2014 you can look at the jurisprudence of somebody like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you can look at the historic contributions of figures like Thurgood Marshall, and get some sense of what would guide my philosophy, in particular \u2014\u2014\nJW: What about their jurisprudence?\nWell, first of all and understanding, most importantly, an understanding of freedom that includes not just the \u201cfreedom from\u201d that is, I think, the only side of freedom that some of our conservative friends are able to see, but also \u201cfreedom to\u201d live a life of your choosing and the fact that makes a claim. And understanding the importance of our proactive positive freedoms, from abortion rights to voting rights, and what that means for our ability to thrive and to live lives of our choosing and to function as a country.\nKK: Can you talk a little bit about your plan, the 15-member Supreme Court plan that you\u2019ve proposed?\nDuring the October presidential debate, Mr. Buttigieg defended court-packing \u2014 adding additional justices, five appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10 \u2014 as a way to limit partisan control over the court. He suggested term limits for justices as an alternative.\nYeah. So, again, I do not want to claim credit for having invented this, but it was published in the Yale Law Journal, I think in the current edition, as part of an article contemplating options for structural reform that go beyond the debate about court packing. I\u2019m not talking about changing the court in order to make it more liberal. My appointments will make it more liberal, at least by the likes of the way these debates are tracked.\nRead Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman\u2019s \u201cHow to Save the Supreme Court.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m talking about a structural reform to change the political stakes of judicial appointments. And the one you\u2019re mentioning that I think deserves to be considered is called a balanced bench. And the idea is you have 15 justices overall, 10 of them arrive in the traditional, you might say, partisan process that we\u2019re used to. The other five can only be seated by a unanimous agreement of the other 10. And the idea is that there will be a depoliticization of those choices. And it might be on a rotating basis. I think the authors in the Yale Law Journal suggest that they be rotated up from the appellate bench. That gets you away from these strange phenomena like the Kennedy brief, where a whole body of casework is done to appeal to the idiosyncrasies of a single perceived swing justice.\nBut more important, to make sure that every vacancy doesn\u2019t turn into another apocalyptic ideological firefight. A different version that is also contemplated in that article would be to make the entire court rotated on and off the appellate bench. Very interesting debate over whether that would even require constitutional reform or whether you could do it by law. By the way, even though this is admittedly bold, it is far from unprecedented for there to be changes to the size and makeup of the court. It\u2019s happened in a substantial way about half a dozen times. I would argue the Republicans changed the size of the Supreme Court to eight until they took power again, very recently. But in terms of actual formal changes, we\u2019ve seen that about half a dozen times.\nMerrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 but was blocked by Republican opposition.\nJW: And another major structural reform that you supported earlier in your campaign was the abolishment of the Electoral College in favor of the national popular vote. You talked about it a lot early on. You haven\u2019t talked about it for a while.\nRead the editorial board\u2019s stance in \u201cFix the Electoral College \u2014 Or Scrap It.\u201d\nSo, that\u2019s false, and I reject any reporting, some of which I\u2019ve seen, I believe some of it coming from this building, that suggests that I backed away from it. I talk about it in virtually every stump speech that I give, and it is, by the way, kind of a tough sell in places like New Hampshire, but I want to make sure that people in New Hampshire hear something that\u2019s not that different from what I have to say when I\u2019m in Manhattan.\nIn December, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Buttigieg was shifting increasingly to the center. The article opens by stating that he began his campaign speaking urgently about reforms needed like the elimination of the Electoral College.\nIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m under any illusions can be delivered in probably one presidential term, but it\u2019s precisely because I think it will take a long time to deliver this, and it may have to be delivered on a delayed-action basis, so it\u2019s harder to know who benefits in the short term, that I think we ought to be making the case for it right now. I mean, first of all, it connects to just the idea of democracy, right? Not the technicality, the system of democracy, but the value that it matters, that we\u2019re a country where the people decide where we\u2019re headed.\nSecond, I remember as a student learning about this, you know, as a high schooler, thinking, \u201cWell, surely the first time it ever actually overrules the American people, America will get rid of it.\u201d That\u2019s now happened twice.\nIt doesn\u2019t even privilege small states. One of the principled arguments for it would be the small states get overlooked, but it doesn\u2019t, it just privileges some states. Right? Small states like Rhode Island get ignored or Wyoming, and big states like Texas or New York get ignored.\nPlus, our well-being has been impacted by the Electoral College far more in terms of the outcome over the course of this nation than the number of presidential campaign rallies held close to where I live.\nAnd so, it\u2019s one of these issues where if there was any principled justification left for the Electoral College, it was the idea that if the American people somehow elected somebody manifestly unfit for the office that there would be some safety valve on that, and instead, the reverse happened. I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. I just get frustrated when it is implied that I talk about this less today than I did six months ago.\nKK: All right.\nCharlie Warzel: If I could pivot to technology and your tech policy. You\u2019ve spoken, and I believe you told Vox recently, that breaking up Big Tech should be an option. It seems like your proposal is somewhat more vague than some of your opponents\u2019. One of the things you mentioned was doubling antitrust enforcement budgets. Can you tell me a little bit about how you plan to go about evaluating whether breaking up should happen? For Facebook, for example, do you think Facebook should be broken up right now?\nMr. Buttigieg was somewhat vague in his response to Vox on whether Big Tech should be broken up. He said, \u201cWe will rigorously enforce the law, and if they continue the behavior, breaking up tech companies should be an option.\u201d\nYeah. So, I think there\u2019s a strong case for that. The reason I don\u2019t think it makes sense for me to say as a candidate, \u201cThis company shall be broken up,\u201d is the same reason I wouldn\u2019t generally say of the outcome of a trial in a judicial process. This \u2014\u2014\nCW: But you can think about their power, right? Right now, as you see the influence that they have in modern politics \u2014\u2014\nAbsolutely. Yeah.\nCW: \u2014\u2014 and say, \u201cThis needs to change.\u201d\nYes. And that\u2019s the problem with Facebook. No one company and no one person should have the kind of power that they\u2019ve accumulated.\nNow, under our existing framework, it was designed to handle monopolies mostly in terms of pricing power. Pricing power is not the biggest worry around the harms that the scope and power of Facebook and other large tech companies have accumulated is, right? The way I would think about it is to, first of all, break out certain things that I think are conflated in the frustrations and anger directed toward big companies.\nOne set of issues has to do with data security and data privacy. That requires a national data law and stronger privacy and security protections, but frankly, dealing with the monopoly problem is neither necessary nor sufficient to fix that. In other words, that\u2019s a stand-alone set of issues that has to happen, because a small company could misbehave with data, too.\nMr. Buttigieg has said he would work with Congress to pass a federal privacy bill and double funding for antitrust enforcement.\nThen we got the monopoly concern, and to put a little more meat on some of what you mentioned, one of the things I think we\u2019re going to need is a standard that shifts the burden to large companies, especially when they\u2019re making acquisitions, like the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook, that are likely anti-competitive.\nCW: If that was happening during your administration, theoretically, you would have vocally supported blocking that?\nYeah. Again, the president doesn\u2019t sit there and direct how an administrative process is going to come out, but yes, there needs to be a prior review. At a certain level, instead of the burden being on the state to demonstrate that some of these mergers will be harmful, I think the burden should be on the company to demonstrate that they won\u2019t.\nCW: O.K. What do you make of your support from Silicon Valley? I mean, the idea that maybe they\u2019re not adequately afraid of you?\nKK: Can you also speak to your relationship with Mark Zuckerberg?\nIn October, Bloomberg News reported that Mr. Zuckerberg advised Mr. Buttigieg on his tech campaign hires.\nYeah. So, we were in college at the same time, got a lot of mutual friends, and it doesn\u2019t mean we agree on a lot of things. So, I\u2019m sure he would vigorously disagree with my assessment of the WhatsApp acquisition, for example.\nCW: Do you think he holds too much power right now?\nYes. No one should have that kind of power. Now, part of the problem is that a social network is a natural monopoly, right? So, if we were just talking about the, what you might call the Facebook part of Facebook, the product that people are most familiar with, if you broke that up, you just wind up with two of them and one of them would die and one of them would be the new one. The real problem is how a corporation of that size acquires other competitors and develops certain powers. And then, there\u2019s a problem of their refusal to accept their responsibility for speech that they make money from. So, if a cable company, or a newspaper, if somebody can show that an ad that you all were going to run is false, you would pull it, and yet Facebook doesn\u2019t want to hold themselves to that same standard.\nMr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly affirmed that Facebook will not check ads from politicians, even if they contain lies, in the interest of free speech. Read The Times\u2019s analysis here.\nKK: But I want to follow up on Charlie\u2019s question. I mean, is Silicon Valley adequately afraid of you? There are other candidates who have used much more bold, intense, I don\u2019t know \u2014\u2014\nMr. Zuckerberg said, in audio leaked to The Verge, that having Senator Warren as president would \u201csuck\u201d for Facebook.\nYes. And some of them seem to get a lot of support out of Silicon Valley, too, so I don\u2019t know. I think you got a lot of folks there who are maybe a little less ideological, who I\u2019m not going to agree with on everything, but also a lot of folks who, I think, are wrestling with what it is they\u2019ve created. The problem is, it shouldn\u2019t just be left to companies to decide how to solve these problems. There needs to be a policy response. Basically what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve outsourced public policy decisions around the limits of speech and misinformation and the handling and the use of data to the companies, which are so big that when they make a corporate policy decision, in effect, they\u2019re actually making a public policy decision. They do it.\nCW: They\u2019re also just platforms for viral advertisement, too.\nYeah. Right. Which is how they make their money, right? Although, I would say that the nonrevenue vitality of social media is just as problematic as the paid stuff.\nKK: We only have about half an hour left, so I want to turn to foreign policy, but before we do, I wanted to ask you one question which we are asking all of our candidates, which is, who has broken your heart?\nI mean, Boston College. I was 11 years old. We were this close to the National Championship. And they came to South Bend, we were one game away, we had beaten Florida State, become No. 1. There wasn\u2019t a B.C.S. back then, so when you finish the season undefeated, you\u2019re the champion. And they came into our stadium, and they broke my little heart.\nIn 1993, Notre Dame\u2019s football team was undefeated and top ranked until it lost to the Boston College Eagles, 41-39, at home in the final game of the regular season. The rivalry between the schools has come to be known as the Holy War.\nKK: As you mentioned, you\u2019ve talked a lot about your faith. Given your faith, how do you reconcile directing the largest, most powerful military in the world with your Christian obligation to love your neighbor? Or enemy. Excuse me. And your neighbor, but mostly your enemies.\nMr. Buttigieg is Episcopalian and outspoken about his faith. St Augustine is one of his major religious influences.\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest problems of being involved in the military at any level, and I suppose we\u2019re all implicated in this just by belonging to this country. You also have to rationalize, as a citizen, how you participate in a society or a country that sometimes does things that are, even when it\u2019s doing the so-called right thing, from the perspective of law, or the law of war, is still doing something that would not be considered Christian or moral by the lights of any number of different faith traditions. Some people take the approach of punching out completely, right? That\u2019s the Walden approach, I guess. I think you have to accept the reality that you are living and working in a broken world, just as we are all broken and beaten, and try to order your steps in a way that brings greater good than harm.\nLook, when you\u2019re in charge of something important, most of when you earn your paycheck is when you\u2019re making decisions between two courses of action, both of which involve harm. Not just to your objectives, but often to your values, and you have to figure out what the right thing is to do. And that\u2019s true for, I think, any position of executive leadership, but certainly when you\u2019re in charge of a government body or a military unit or the entire country and making those life and death decisions. That\u2019s what you have to weigh. It\u2019s not finding what the perfect answer is. Well, it isn\u2019t a McKinsey puzzle where you might be able to compute the right answer. Moral puzzles are different because they don\u2019t have a correct final answer. They have courses of action, some of which can do more good and some of which can do more harm.\nKK: So, the number of countries that the United States military now has troops in is somewhat astounding. Can you make the case for why we need to have an American presence in, for instance, the African nation of Mali?\nSo, we need to maintain the ability to project force in a way that will protect the homeland and meet our core security and national objectives. What I will also say is that there are a lot of troops deployed around the world right now, pursuant to an A.U.M.F., that was passed to deal with 9/11.\nCongress passed the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (A.U.M.F.) three days after the Sept. 11 attacks. The agreement authorized use of force against those responsible for the attacks.\nI\u2019m not sure about Mali, but I remember in Niger, members of Congress admitting, after troops were killed there, that they didn\u2019t know we had troops there.\nThe deaths of four American soldiers in Niger in October 2017 ignited debate over the A.U.M.F. Many Americans did not realize the U.S. had forces in Niger. Senator Tim Kaine, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the deaths showed that U.S. forces are \u201cin many more countries than Americans have been told.\u201d\nKK: It\u2019s also an antiterrorism operation.\nYeah. Is that under the A.U.M.F.? I\u2019d have to think about how those two strands connected. But the point is, the A.U.M.F. had no sunset, and the scope creep most recently, I think, brought to life by the Afghanistan Papers, but we\u2019ve been looking at it for more than a decade, is one of the reasons why I believe that a future A.U.M.F. should always have a three-year sunset. And let\u2019s have that debate.\nThe Trump administration has opposed putting a sunset clause in an A.U.M.F., on the ground that it will embolden enemies who might see it as a date for withdrawal.\nIf a president, if I or any other president, believe in my judgment from a national security perspective that it\u2019s appropriate to have troops deployed somewhere, I should be able to convince Congress of that. Not to mention the fact that the war powers are supposed to [inaudible 01:02:20] in Congress anyway.\nAnd by the way, this also helps with the fact that Congress has been all too happy, I think, not to get involved in questions like whether the A.U.M.F. that was supposed to deal with 9/11 justifies troops being in Mali or Niger. So, some of these deployments are problematic, and we need a much more crisply defined mission both for the war on terror in general and for future military engagements, even while recognizing that we are going to have a base architecture globally that ensures that we maintain global military superiority, especially as we get into a more and more multipolar world.\nAlex Kingsbury: Since you brought it up, can I ask about the Afghanistan Papers? Were you surprised by their broad conclusions, that the public has been lied to for a great many years about the possibility of success?\nIn December, The Washington Post reported on a confidential trove of government documents that revealed how American government officials hid from the public evidence that the war in Afghanistan couldn\u2019t be won. Read the report here.\nAngered, but honestly, not completely surprised. I remember these debates raging in the time that I was deployed, and you could argue that was very late in the war. In fact, I thought it was the end of the war. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights, and that was years ago. And I even remember they posted one of those inscrutable PowerPoints on the wall of the gym by the treadmills. And I remember staring at it, and the PowerPoint was supposed to hold the lines of effort that constituted the mission as O.E.F. turned into Resolute Support, and just squinting at it and thinking, I know a fair amount about why we thought we were here, and I can\u2019t make sense of this.\nOperation Enduring Freedom was the official government name for the war on terror. Resolute Support is a NATO-led operation to provide training and support for Afghan security forces.\nAK: So if the mission is unclear and civilian casualties are at all-time high now, is the war being waged there a morally defensible war? To go back to what you were talking about before.\nWell, unfortunately I think it\u2019s some of our moral intuitions that keep us chasing after some lofty and possibly impossible outcomes.\nAK: Possibly impossible?\nLet me rephrase. Well, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible. They\u2019re not impossible. It\u2019s not impossible for Afghanistan to become a thriving, prosperous, democratic state, but it is impossible for that to happen quickly. It is impossible for it to happen before the time has come when we need to withdraw our troop presence, which is to say that time has come and it hasn\u2019t happened.\nAK: The Trump administration has been trying to do it for three years now. How would you do it any sort of quicker?\nTrump\u2019s administration is not big on decision making and also not big on multilateral diplomacy. Look, in order to do this, the thing we have going for us is that leaving Afghanistan is possibly the one thing that all of the parties think ought to happen. The U.S. left, the U.S. right, the international community, the Taliban and in the long run the Afghan government all want to see this happen. So the question is when we leave, are we going to leave well or are we going to leave poorly? What leaving well looks like is to make sure that there is some kind of negotiated political settlement that gets us here. Not based on a spontaneous invitation to Camp David, but based on a proper level of engagement with the government, which has been sidelined for most of this from what I can tell. The Afghan government, I mean, the Taliban and regional players that play a hugely important role in that area. I\u2019m thinking about Pakistan in particular.\nA 2018 poll from YouGov found that 61 percent of Americans support a withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nJD: Coming back to the question Katie asked about troop deployments across the world, could you see a scenario in Afghanistan where the United States would keep some level of troops to maintain some level of stability?\nWell, look at what we had in northern Syria, a very minimal, light, specialized presence of intelligence and special ops capability that was able to, while they were there, hold the line. Not by assuming responsibility for stability and prosperity of Syria, but by preventing the worst outcomes and being able to alert the United States command when there were likely to be things that could imperil our troops or the homeland. That kind of thing I think will be part of the pathway out of getting large ground troops there or part of the pathway for moving large ground troops.\nKK: Can I turn to another part of the world?\nYes.\nKK: Assume that for a moment that the Chinese government makes a decision that they\u2019re going to flood the streets with troops in order to crack down on the protests that are happening in Hong Kong. What would you do? How would you respond as president?\nWell, the message would need to go to China, that if they\u2019re going to perpetrate a repeat of Tiananmen, that that will lead to them being isolated in the community of nations, and that the United States will use the tools that we have, including diplomatic and economic and information tools, to make good on that so that they have a strong reason not to do it.\nMr. Buttigieg outlined his foreign policy plans in a June speech at Indiana University\u2019s Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies. He said China should be censured for its human rights record but engaged as a strategic partner on a number of thorny issues including terrorism and climate change.\nKK: That\u2019s beforehand, right? What happens if the troops actually go into the streets and there\u2019s mass killings and democratic protests are being squashed?\nI don\u2019t want to jump into hypotheticals, but I\u2019ll say that this is an example of where U.S. policy should stand on the awareness that our interests and our values are inseparable. That every time the United States has tried to pursue its interest at the expense of its values, sooner or later that\u2019s caught up to us. And so our approach needs to be guided by the understanding that part of what is in the American interest is the fact that we stand up for values that are shared.\nRemember, in a scenario like that or frankly in the scenario we\u2019re seeing right now \u2014 this is not just something happening inside Hong Kong or China and a conversation inside the United States. There is such a thing as a global community, and part of the role of the United States is to mobilize that global community in the defense of beliefs around human rights and representation. That ultimately should also be consistent with the stated Chinese goal of stability, but is consistent with our conviction that stability won\u2019t come through repression.\nBA: China has detained hundreds of thousands of its citizens because they\u2019re Muslim. It\u2019s your judgment that they haven\u2019t yet crossed that red line?\nTimes reporting in November revealed a merciless government-driven crackdown on Muslims in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. Read the report here.\nWhat red line?\nBA: You were saying that if China were to repeat the Tiananmen experience, if China were to cross the line and violate human rights, then it would become necessary to respond. Is it not already necessary?\nOh, it\u2019s necessary to respond. Yeah. What I\u2019m saying is we should have a warning about the consequences of those kinds of violent repression, but yes. Right now we are seeing people rounded up, put into camps in huge numbers, and we are seeing not a peep out of the United States president, even by way of moral support for those whose rights are being trampled there and evidenced, by the way, that that silence was purchased in the course of a trade negotiation that has yet to yield anything to the United States anyway. So there\u2019s no question that we right now should be using the tools that we have, especially as what should be a leading voice in the international community.\nIn December, the House passed a bill, 407-1, requiring the Trump administration to condemn abuse against the Uighurs and call for the closing of China\u2019s detention camps.\nOf course, it\u2019s not possible to do that right now because our own president is fanning the flames of Islamophobia right here in the United States. So it is functionally impossible given how much the use of those diplomatic and moral powers relies not just on policy moves, right? But on language and tone and leadership from the American president, it is functionally impossible to do that so long as this president\u2019s in office.\nSerge Schmemann: Mr. Mayor, may I ask you about immigration? You had mentioned that this will be one of the major challenges of the next president. Are you going to, as president, reverse some of President Trump\u2019s policies, his agreements with third world countries on asylum or not letting asylum seekers await the judgment within the United States? What would you do? What would be your criteria for deportations?\nIn September, the Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration\u2019s new rule making it difficult for most migrants and especially Central Americans to seek asylum in the United States. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s rule, migrants cannot apply for asylum unless they have applied and been denied asylum in a country they pass through on the way to the United States.\nSo when it comes to asylum seekers, first of all, it\u2019s recognized that measures like the family case management program worked. Virtually everybody in that program appeared when they were supposed to and so I would not continue the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy.\nThe Family Case Management Program used case managers to ensure migrants adhered to their legal obligations. It was ended by the Trump administration in 2017. It had high levels of compliance, according to a Department of Homeland Security report.\nAnd we need to recognize in our policies and in our tone the idea that asylum is a right. It\u2019s not doing somebody a favor. At least applying for asylum is recognized as a right. It\u2019s one of many things that need to change quickly by way of administrative action. The thrust of my vision on immigration centers on legislative reform, but upfront we know that there need to be actions to ensure that family separation can\u2019t happen again.\nTo the extent that the government is in the business of housing at all, I believe that should be handled by H.H.S., which is designed around health and not by Customs and Border Protection, which is not set up for that kind of role, and a number of other steps that we\u2019ve got to take right away.\nAs to what you\u2019re saying in terms of the administration\u2019s posture toward the countries whose misery, often, is propelling this wave of migration, it is perfectly self-defeating to threaten to withdraw aid from, for example, the Central American Triangle countries when by far the best way forward to prevent a migration crisis in our interest is to make sure that people are living prosperous or at least minimally can count on safety in their own home countries. Part of which can be supported with American investment. Again, it\u2019s not that we can fix \u2014 speaking about what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s not possible \u2014 it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to fix what\u2019s going on in every country. We should at least be doing our part to help.\nSS: People will continue trying to reach the United States. What would you do as president if tens of thousands of Central Americans showed up at the border?\nWell, we still need to maintain a border. It matters, and crossing the border illegally will be illegal when I\u2019m president, too.\nJD: Mr. Mayor, to follow up on that, some Democrats seem to argue that comprehensive immigration reform could be as politically risky as say Medicare for all.\nYes.\nJD: How great a priority would that sort of comprehensive immigration reform be in your administration?\nIt\u2019s a priority because of the way it\u2019s being used to divide Americans. My biggest priority is to bring the country together. Could it be divisive? Sure. I mean, that\u2019s why this president uses it.\nThe irony is that there is that same majority I was talking about. A powerful American majority, not a consensus, but a majority, to do all of the things we\u2019re talking about. Pathway to citizenship, protections for Dreamers, reforms to the asylum system, reform to the lawful immigration system, like how my dad got here, and moving away from a system and numbers and quotas and caps that are not based on anything currently real. And I think that this administration, if they wanted to, could have passed comprehensive immigration reform and taken credit for the achievement. Unfortunately, this president believes that it is more useful for him to divide us around the failure than it is for him to take credit for the achievement, and so we continue entering our 35th year or so since there\u2019s been meaningful reform.\nIn 1986 President Reagan signed a major immigration reform bill creating a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to America before 1982. There has been little meaningful immigration reform in the past two decades, though in 2012 President Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, for the so-called Dreamers. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s father immigrated from Malta.\nJB: Sorry, go ahead. You were in the middle of your answer.\nI was going to say a lot of these concerns that we have around the border change when we have actually fixed the fundamental problem of the legal framework that we have.\nJB: Can we turn to climate change for a minute?\nYep.\nJB: You\u2019re proposing quite a sweeping reform to the country\u2019s approach to climate change. Yet in the detailed proposal you\u2019ve submitted, there\u2019s not a word about nuclear power, which now provides something like 20 percent of electricity in this country with no carbon at all. Would you phase out the existing plants and stop all research on future nuclear technology?\nOther Democratic contenders, like Andrew Yang, have made nuclear energy a central feature of their climate plans.\nI would not look for new nuclear as part of our power mix. I also don\u2019t think we can afford to be dogmatic about this. As you said, it\u2019s carbon free and by far the biggest threat we face right now is carbon. However, you can\u2019t ignore the waste concerns associated with nuclear power as we know it. Research to develop nuclear possibilities that don\u2019t have those risks or don\u2019t produce that kind of waste, of course we should be pursuing that. As far as the kind of nuclear power that we currently have, the kind of fission power that generates waste, I don\u2019t believe that that is the long-term future when we know so much potential lies in other forms of renewable energy generation that don\u2019t have that set of problems. So yes, it is part of our pathway to carbon neutrality. There\u2019s no question. It\u2019s part of that medium-term mix. When I talk about that medium term, I\u2019m really talking about the existing installed generation base and not adding more.\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has devoted significant time and funds to research on thorium, an alternative to uranium as a source of clean energy. Read more from the World Economic Forum here.\nAK: When you phase out the nuclear plants, do you support keeping all the waste at the closed facilities like it is now or building Yucca Mountain to store it safely?\nCongress designated Yucca Mountain as the site for a nuclear waste repository in 1987, but it has never been licensed. If constructed, it would use a complex 1,000 feet below the mountain\u2019s summit.\nSo the problem with the Yucca Mountain is it\u2019s not got the consent of those who would be impacted, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an acceptable solution as long as there is not that kind of consent. There\u2019s been talk about certain kinds of safer on-site or near-site storage than we have today. No solution is perfect, but we certainly need to continue developing safe methods for storage and removal.\nIn March, Nevada\u2019s Democratic representatives unveiled legislation that would prevent the construction of the facility as long as the state, local and tribal communities haven\u2019t given their consent.\nKK: Do you think there\u2019s enough effort to build consensus to build Yucca Mountain at this point? I mean we haven\u2019t even, communities \u2014\u2014\nThere\u2019s been the reverse. There\u2019s been no effort. They\u2019ve completely ignored communities, right?\nAK: But no one\u2019s going to put nuclear waste in their backyard\nKK: Yeah. Exactly. No one\u2019s going to want nuclear waste in their backyard.\nWell, the blue-ribbon commission laid out a framework for some kind of an informed-consent process, and we\u2019ve seen the reverse. Just failing to inform even elected officials about some decisions and some moves. So what we know is consensus may be elusive. The wrong way to get it is what they\u2019ve been doing lately.\nKK: So I hate to cut us off from climate since it\u2019s such a huge issue, but we have only a few minutes left and we have a lot of other things we want to get to. Maybe we can turn to health care for a few minutes and then go back to a couple of economic questions.\nJeneen Interlandi: Do you think that families should be able to obtain religious or personal exemptions for mandatory vaccination?\nNo. We\u2019ve seen the public health impact of, I can\u2019t even call it pseudoscience, but the way that people have been steered off things that are necessary. This is complex. Different states have different frameworks, some of which acknowledge these kinds of exemptions and some of which don\u2019t. I acknowledge that those differences exist among the states, but we have to move forward a world of universal vaccination. And I believe this strongly enough that personally I\u2019ve done what I can just from a public education standpoint, including this somewhat awkward spectacle of inviting news cameras to watch me get my vaccinations at the county health department. Just to try to send that message to remind folks of that responsibility.\nEarlier in his campaign, Mr. Buttigieg said he backed \u201cpersonal belief and religious exemptions\u201d on vaccines, then backtracked and said he only supported medical exemptions.\nJI: Have you thought about what you would do as president to promote that message and to kind of shore up public trust in vaccines? Because it is waning.\nRecent reporting has shown that trust in vaccines has declined in the past decade among American adults.\nYeah, I think that people need to hear that from the president. The president is a messenger on public health and maybe I\u2019ll continue that spectacle, hopefully I\u2019ll have a little more to show up here. [MAYOR POINTS TO BICEP. LAUGHTER] But also in terms of the message we send about the role that this has in parenting and in citizenship and in being part of your community to make sure that the community is safe from communicable disease.\nJI: As president, would you use march-in rights to produce low-cost insulin? So overriding corporate patents on drugs that are overpriced?\nMarch-in rights were created in 1980 under the Bayh-Dole Act. Some argue they could be used to lower the cost of drugs like insulin. They allow a government agency to \u201cmarch in\u201d and circumvent a patent if a therapy isn\u2019t made available to the public within a reasonable time.\nI would view that as a last resort, but I believe it should not be taken off the table.\nJI: Something you would consider.\nIf only because I think knowing that is being held in reserve might be what it takes to get a better result while at the table. So definitely something I would hope never to use, but I would not rule it out.\nJI: I just want to talk a little bit very quickly about the public option, which is what you\u2019ve supported in terms of health care reform. You\u2019ve said yourself a couple of times today that this is still actually a bold vision. It\u2019s kind of sort of gotten framed as weak sauce relative to Medicare for all, but it\u2019s actually still a pretty heavy lift. So can you talk a little bit about how you see getting that through Congress, where there\u2019s going to be a lot of opposition, and what you think it would cost?\nYeah. So the bedrock for this as for many of the other policies I\u2019m talking about that yes, put me certainly further than the Obama administration was able to be, for example, and would be progressive. The great thing about this is they command a support of the American majority. So Medicare for all if you want it has strong support. Often when people tell pollsters they\u2019re for Medicare for all, this is what they mean, right? So there\u2019s issue after issue where what we\u2019ve got to do is manage the daylight between what commands a majority among the American people and what can get a majority in the American Congress.\nPart of that is why we need structural reforms, why we\u2019ve got to do something about things like gerrymandering and other issues that help to explain why Congress is the way it is. But I also believe that a very good use of the president\u2019s time and energy is to be personally present in even conservative states or districts where measures like this have popular support. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fanciful about this because you can just look at the political life of the A.C.A., which again was toxic for Democrats in 2010 when I was getting crushed in my first experience on the ballot in Indiana, and by 2018 was the winning issue for Democrats such that even when the Republicans controlled everything, they could not make good on their central campaign promise, even when they were in charge. Right? So we know that when we restore the center of gravity of politics to the lived experience of Americans who are affected by political decisions and not the noise that this president creates, we have a winning hand to get these policies through.\nIn 2017, Mr. Trump claimed \u201cwe have essentially repealed Obamacare.\u201d In fact, the Affordable Care Act has grown only more popular \u2014 a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in 2018 found the law\u2019s favorability at 54 percent, its highest point since it began surveying people about it in 2010.\nJI: Can you talk a little bit about the cost itself?\nYeah. So we\u2019ve scored it at $1.5 trillion over 10 years. In order to achieve that, actually a fully 1.4 of it can be recouped just from rolling back the corporate tax rate portion of the Trump tax cuts. For the other 0.1, $100 billion, I would account that as part of the savings that we will get from the negotiation of prescription drug prices by Medicare and H.H.S., which I think narrowly that move alone C.B.O. had between $3 billion and $400 billion over a decade. We believe the overall savings to the Treasury of the different moves we aim to make would come to over $600 billion. Anyway, I only need 0.1 to make up the gap between 1.4 and 1.5 [trillion].\nMayor Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said his health care plan, \u201cMedicare for all who want it,\u201d would be almost entirely paid for by rolling Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts back to 35 percent rates.\nJI: So here\u2019s the thing I kind of want to talk about.\nYeah.\nJI: $1.5 trillion is a lot less than Medicare for all, than Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan would cost, right? But that\u2019s over 10 years. If your plan succeeds and more people choose the public option versus private insurance beyond 10 years, it could become quite expensive. What do you say to arguments that ultimately it would be just as expensive as something like Medicare for all, so why not just do that?\nSenator Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan is estimated to cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade. Read how she did her math in the Upshot.\nWell, the problem with Medicare for all or that version of Medicare for all that my competitors have isn\u2019t just the cost. I certainly believe that when you propose something with a cost, you got to be able to explain how to pay it. And that\u2019s a problem there. It\u2019s also the idea of dictating to people what their choice ought to be.\nYou look at the plans that a lot of folks, including a lot of folks in labor, have fought for, sometimes trading off wages to get them. They\u2019re not interested in being kicked off the plan. I think just baking that little bit of humility into the policy pays off because it also, it\u2019s not just \u2014 sorry \u2014 but it\u2019s not just the problem of dictating that this plan will be better. There\u2019s a comparable danger of policy arrogance in supposing that we can guess from Washington the correct number of years before the transition should happen. So what I\u2019m supporting is a way for the transition to be organic.\nJI: O.K. So just one very quick follow-up to that. With respect to the public option being a better choice and that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s often used to kind of promote the idea. How do you make that work if doctors and hospitals can simply choose not to accept the public option as long as private still exists? How do you address that concern in your thinking?\nSo I believe the economy of scale, especially if you compare it to Medicare, right? The places where Medicare is accepted indicate that as long as a reimbursement is appropriate, that there should not be a problem on the provider side. Now I do think that you can\u2019t just copy-paste what we\u2019re doing with Medicare now because if that were where we needed it to be, we wouldn\u2019t see the problem we have with the loss of \u2014\u2014\nJI: So do you reimburse at a higher or lower rate? Sorry, last one.\nKK: Jeneen!\nOverall reimbursements are likely to have to go higher, not just in the public but in Medicare as we know it, especially in areas that are losing providers like rural areas.\nKK: So we have a couple of questions about your time and your mayorship in South Bend and I want to get to those if you don\u2019t mind. Then we\u2019ll come back to the economic questions.\nNF: If you don\u2019t mind, I wanted to get back to what Aisha was saying. I found your answer to her kind of vague, quite vague, and I thought she was asking something really important. A lot of young people and not so young people are disgusted by growing up in a system in which they\u2019re seeing more and more of the wealth of the country going to a smaller and smaller group of people at the expense of everyone else. That small group of people having an increasing amount of political and economic power. Some of your opponents have had very clear solutions or what they call very clear solutions for those problems. I\u2019m wondering if in that time we have, if you could give specific solutions to say what the government could do to address the growing financial inequities, what the government could do about the power of the financial industry, about the corruption of politics, about the corruption of industry itself?\nOf course. Yeah, I mean, I would argue that the proposals I\u2019ve put forward on dealing with precisely this set of problems is more specific than most of my competitors\u2019. That\u2019s everything from my proposal to double the rate of unionization in this country, to my insistence that we increase the minimum wage to some of the other labor market reforms I\u2019ve proposed around taking care of contractors and gig workers, to campaign-finance reforms up to and including a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United.\nMr. Buttigieg is one of several candidates who have earned the approval of the grass roots group End Citizens United for his commitment to anti-corruption legislation. He defended his intent to use a constitutional amendment to do so, arguing: \u201cDoes anybody really think we\u2019re going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn\u2019t drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.\u201d\nNot to mention things we could do in the shorter run, ranging from ideas already baked into H.R. 1, around drowning out dark money, to heavier-lift reforms around public financing of campaigns, while we are working the bigger generational fight on things like Citizens United. I believe that we need to be investing in the sources of social mobility and domestic competitiveness to include my proposal that we triple funding for Title I in education, to include everything that\u2019s contemplated in the Douglass Plan, to include what we need to do around infrastructure. And that in order to do that, we must raise taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations. So I am no less determined and no less specific than my competitors about this. What I think might be happening \u2014\u2014\nMr. Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Sanders have all pledged to triple Title I funding for low-income schools, and Senator Warren has pledged to quadruple it.\nNF: What are your questions on raises?\nSorry?\nNF: What are the questions on raising taxes?\nSay again?\nNF: On raising taxes, what are your proposals?\nSo a financial transactions tax, rollback wholesale of the Trump tax cuts with a special focus on what\u2019s going on in the corporate-rate tax cut. Close the 199A loophole, deal with some of the enforcement deficiencies that are driving the big part of the revenue gap right now I think. I\u2019m also open to a wealth tax. I just would not put my signature proposal in a position of being completely dependent on a tax that is constitutionally untested. In principle I think it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just not counting on it.\nIn the December Democratic debate, Mr. Buttigieg criticized Senator Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan as \u201cextreme.\u201d He cautioned that candidates should \u201cbe smart about the promises we\u2019re making, make sure they\u2019re promises we can keep.\u201d\nNow just to get to the heart of the question that maybe we didn\u2019t touch about what interests a younger generation of voters. I think part of this might be a question of tone, too. I think that the younger I was, the more I was inclined to think about politics as combat. Having been responsible for a city, I think about it differently today, but what I don\u2019t view as different is the importance of restoring power to workers and citizens. When I say power, I mean both political power and wealth, which becomes both economic and political power at the expense of those who have concentrated it too much in today\u2019s world.\nNF: How would you double unionization?\nSo part of it has to do with who can organize. Making it possible, for example, for gig workers to organize, as I\u2019ve called for. Making it possible for there to be more scope for multi-employer bargaining. If you are one of those fast-food workers and you\u2019re in a McDonald\u2019s and there\u2019s an Arby\u2019s across the street, you should be able to team up.\nPart of it is how you can unionize. We have penalties for company interference in union elections, but the penalties are so weak that even when they are imposed by what I view as a much-weakened enforcement structure \u2014 both in terms of the Department of Labor and N.L.R.B. \u2014 even when they are imposed, they\u2019re not really enough to change behavior. Which is why I\u2019ve specified the need for fines in the adequate range of the multimillions that would actually make it a different calculation for companies to make it difficult to unionize and we need an end to right-to-work. Right-to-work is a restriction. It\u2019s talked about differently in conservative political language, but it is a restriction on the ability of employers and employees to negotiate, and I would remove it.\nThe Times editorial board weighed in on the importance of centering labor issues in the 2020 campaign, particularly ideas like sectoral bargaining and prohibiting \u201cright to work\u201d laws, which allow workers in union workplaces to refuse union membership.\nKK: Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but I want to get back to South Bend for a minute. Rape, robbery, and assaults are all crimes that are at much higher rates in South Bend than they are for example in New York City or in Indiana versus New York. Why haven\u2019t you been able to do much about those types of crimes?\nSince 2012, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s first year in office, South Bend has averaged 5,890 reported serious crimes a year, down from an average of 6,845 in the three years prior. According to The South Bend Tribune, burglaries declined under his administration, but aggravated assaults increased.\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you what we have done. We have group violence intervention that has been able to deal with gang and group violence and in particular gun violence in our city, hasn\u2019t ended it. We\u2019ve had some terrible years, but my first year we had 18 homicides, I believe, and we have been able to see a shift in that.\nThe South Bend Group Violence Intervention strategy was introduced to the city in 2013 with the aim of curbing gun violence. The strategy, developed by David Kennedy at John Jay College, relies on direct communication with people most likely to commit violence.\nOf course, it\u2019s different from New York. The per capita personal income in my city has finally gone above $20,000. We have poverty rates similar to Baltimore\u2019s, but in many of these categories, crime rates there are different. Now having said that, I should also mention that you brought up at least two categories of crime, rape and aggravated assault, where reporting has changed. And it is my fervent hope without coming over and telling you what to do that when folks report on in particular data that is compiled in the F.B.I.\u2019s uniform crime database, U.C.R. database, that attention is paid to the language warning about why it is not a good idea to compare between the different jurisdictions due to reporting differences and also some of the pitfalls of reporting over the years when some of the standards changed.\nThe poverty rate in South Bend is estimated at 25.4 percent. The poverty rate in Baltimore is estimated at 23.8 percent.\nNF: Haven\u2019t reporting standards had been changed for other jurisdictions, too?\nSay again?\nNF: Haven\u2019t the reporting standards for aggravated assault changed for other jurisdictions, too?\nYes and no. So what happened with rape was a nationwide change in the U.C.R. reporting standards and so you can even break out what is called legacy rate and the new standard. In the case of aggravated assault, I know of changes that happened that led to more reporting of it in my jurisdiction. I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s part of moves that have been made in other police departments.\nIn 2012, the attorney general announced a new and more expansive definition of rape, a victory for survivors and advocates. The definition is available on the Department of Justice\u2019s website here.\nNF: How much of the crime increase do you think might be due to the bad relationship between the police and the black community?\nI believe police officers by and large get up in the morning and do their job no matter what\u2019s happening in politics. I do think that there is a cost to reductions in police legitimacy that come about, especially when there are cases of abuses both from around the country and what happens in any local area.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing a lot are cycles of gun violence, assault too, but especially with gun violence where you have a family, someone is attacked or killed. The family weighs whether to take that to the police or to handle that in a way that leads to more violence and so the less comfort there is reaching out to the police, the more likely it is that there will be contagion between one violent act and another. That\u2019s actually even more true as you get out of the ones that we\u2019ve been better able to get a grasp on through our group violence intervention strategy where it\u2019s connected to, whether it\u2019s a formal gang or what\u2019s called a group, it can often be comparatively easier to map and enforce on the associations that lead to that violence than when you have looser associations and sometimes families.\nNF: You mentioned poverty. You\u2019ve done in a lot in the downtown area of South Bend. In the poor neighborhoods you\u2019ve knocked down a lot of buildings and some have said you\u2019ve not done enough for housing there to replace that and that there are sort of two South Bends. Is that a fair criticism?\nKK: I want to be respectful of the mayor\u2019s time, so after this maybe we can ask you one last question and then we\u2019ll let you go. Is that O.K?\nSure, yeah. So our effort on vacant and abandoned houses was very much about directing dollars for improvement in low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods. Because the No. 1 thing I heard knocking on doors in those neighborhoods from voters and residents when I was a candidate was why has there been a collapsing house next door to me for 12 years? Often they didn\u2019t know or necessarily care that the city did not own that property, just because it was vacant and abandoned. Often we didn\u2019t even know who did own it because in our housing market, again \u2014\u2014\nI know this doesn\u2019t always compute in New York, but you can get a pretty good house on the west side of South Bend for 25 thousand bucks. So when it falls, it\u2019s in bad shape and it falls to eight or nine thousand bucks. Someone who just owns this as a line on a spreadsheet anyway, and they\u2019re not even from in town, just walks away. They don\u2019t even bother selling it or disposing of it, or they cleverly hide who owns it. Anyway, my point is we directed dollars to remove the houses that couldn\u2019t be saved and to improve the houses that could precisely because of the importance of supporting low-income neighborhoods.\nIn 2017, the median property value of a house in South Bend was $81,100, according to Data USA. Nationally that figure is closer to $217,600.\nSo while we did a lot of work in our downtown for sure, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that a downtown that used to be characterized as dead or dying is growing. It\u2019s equally important to me, if not more so, that we\u2019ve created opportunity for folks around the city and that we\u2019ve invested directly in neighborhoods. We\u2019ve also invested directly in home repair, knowing that there\u2019s not only a moral and economic empowerment rationale for keeping people in their home, but frankly it\u2019s also a public safety rationale.\nThere are a lot of folks in these neighborhoods who are not afraid of the police or don\u2019t respect the police, but they respect Grandma. And I want Grandma to be able to afford to own her home, stay there and be on her porch, as part of what keeps the fabric of the neighborhood intact and makes it safer. So there have been justified critiques that we may have used code enforcement as a blunt instrument in some cases and listening to neighborhood feedback improve that over time, but it\u2019s very important to me that it\u2019d be understood that our effort to direct dollars, whether it was for demolishing collapsing structures or for enhancing ones that could be saved, was very much about supporting low-income residents.\nKK: Brent, you want to finish?\nBS: Something we ask everybody: What is it that you are most likely to fail at as president?\nWow.\nBS: And that\u2019s the same expression we get.\nWell \u2014\u2014\nMC: Don\u2019t cop out on this.\nI know. I\u2019m tempted to go with a condiment reference, but I\u2019m going to behave. Well, let me say this. First of all, there are some problems you can solve and then there\u2019s some problems you can manage and a lot of the most important problems we face, both internationally and domestically, will be managed, improved, but we have to face that one presidential or two presidential terms won\u2019t be enough to solve them.\nIf I\u2019m being more specific about something that I don\u2019t think I will win, I would say social media. I view myself as a digital native. I spend less and less, but a fair amount of time, on social media. People in my generation have become preposterously wealthy creating it, but we have not yet got a handle on it. The one thing I am learning is just how much daylight there is between what has currency on social media and what I\u2019m getting asked about when I\u2019m on the ground, and I would not be surprised if it continues to be the case that doing what I view to be the right thing as president is not just politically costly in general but may cost me the hearts and minds of those who are disproportionately represented online.\nKK: Wait. So, your answer is you\u2019re going to get canceled on Twitter?\nI just might get canceled.\nKK: All right.

More Privacy Protections Throws Surveillance Bill Talks Into Disarray\nAs time runs out to renew three F.B.I. investigative tools for terrorism and spy inquiries, both parties are divided and President Trump remains a wild card.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 An urgent push by Congress to renew several expiring F.B.I. surveillance powers foundered on Wednesday, as House Democrats feuded privately over stronger privacy protections and Republicans remained uncertain about what President Trump, a vocal skeptic of government spying, would accept.\nThe powers \u2014 a set of tools put in place after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to aid F.B.I. investigations of terrorism and espionage suspects \u2014 will expire on March 15 unless Congress moves to extend them. But a range of surveillance critics, from progressive civil liberties advocates to conservative allies of Mr. Trump outraged by the Russia inquiry, see legislation to do so as a potential vehicle to force new restrictions.\nOn Wednesday, a carefully brokered attempt by House Democrats to extend the programs with some new limits collapsed just hours before the House Judiciary Committee was set to begin debate. A hearing to consider the measure was abruptly canceled, 65 minutes before it was scheduled to begin, after a liberal-leaning Democratic lawmaker challenged it as not going far enough.\nAcross the Capitol, with just over two weeks to go before the expiration of the authorities, Senate Republicans have yet to resolve their own differences over the issue. Some Republican lawmakers have called for sweeping new restrictions, while others want to extend the laws without any changes.\nHanging over the entire endeavor is Mr. Trump, a wild card in any legislative negotiation who is particularly unpredictable on the issue of government surveillance. The president has frequently complained about government surveillance \u2014 he once claimed falsely that Barack Obama tapped his phones in Trump Tower \u2014 and raged over how the F.B.I. obtained a warrant to wiretap his former campaign adviser Carter Page when it was investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Those long-simmering gripes have raised doubts even among Mr. Trump\u2019s allies about what he would sign into law.\nAs time runs out to extend the powers, lawmakers and aides in both parties and on both sides of the Capitol are increasingly worried that the F.B.I. authorities will expire amid political paralysis. They include the ability to collect business records relevant to a national security investigation, to conduct \u201croving\u201d wiretaps that enable investigators to swiftly follow suspects who change phones and to use \u201clone wolf\u201d wiretaps for terrorism suspects who lack ties to a foreign group like Al Qaeda.\nThe House Judiciary Committee had been set on Wednesday to consider a bill that would extend the three expiring provisions while terminating legal authority for a dysfunctional and defunct N.S.A. call records program.\nThat measure, crafted by Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairmen of the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, would also make several other adjustments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which governs national security wiretapping on domestic soil and has become a political flash point in the wake of the Trump-Russia investigation.\nA dispute over whether that bill went far enough erupted on Wednesday when Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, made clear that she would offer a series of amendments to curtail surveillance. Mr. Nadler, Mr. Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi had rejected the changes as going too far, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\nMs. Lofgren\u2019s proposals, which are backed by civil liberties advocates and some Republican allies of Mr. Trump, included requiring the appointment of a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d to critique the government\u2019s arguments in every application for the FISA court\u2019s permission to wiretap an American. They would also ban the use of business-records collection orders to obtain people\u2019s cellphone location, web browsing and search history data.\nWithout the changes, which she had tried to include in the bill during a round of negotiations with Mr. Nadler, Ms. Lofgren said the proposed limits on the government\u2019s surveillance powers would amount to little.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I am an unreasonable person, but what was advanced, to me, was so pitiful that it is not even worth pursuing,\u201d Ms. Lofgren said in an interview Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to reform the system,\u201d she added. \u201cWe should take that opportunity.\u201d\nHer refusal to back down posed a challenge to Mr. Nadler, raising the possibility that liberal-leaning Democrats on the Judiciary Committee would team with Republicans skeptical about government surveillance to force through the changes Ms. Lofgren wanted. That would have broken the deal Mr. Nadler had negotiated with Mr. Schiff, who is allied with centrist Democrats with more hawkish positions on national security issues.\nMr. Nadler canceled the session rather than allow that to happen. Aides to him and Mr. Schiff said they would continue to work with Ms. Lofgren on the legislation, but warned that the dispute increased the chances Congress would come under pressure to simply extend the authorities without changes.\nAdding to the confusion, the Trump administration\u2019s official position is that Congress should extend the expiring laws without any changes \u2014 the kind of \u201cclean extension\u201d that Attorney General William P. Barr urged Republicans senators to back at a closed-door lunch on Tuesday.\nMr. Barr is said to have assured Republican senators that he could go a long way in placating Mr. Trump by making administrative, rather than statutory, changes to FISA procedures.\nBut it is not clear that Mr. Trump supports his administration\u2019s stated position, and he has demonstrated little understanding of the nuances of FISA, a notoriously complex law. The president has privately said he would prefer to do away with FISA altogether, according to people familiar with the matter \u2014 even though the part used to wiretap Mr. Page is not among the expiring provisions.\nAs the deadline nears, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has not scheduled any hearing to consider legislation to extend the provisions.\nSeveral congressional staff members from both parties said it appeared that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, might seek to jam through an extension with no changes \u2014 perhaps until the end of the year, or even for several years \u2014 by attaching it to unrelated legislation.\n\u201cI hope that when the Senate deals with these expiring provisions in a couple weeks we can continue to have them in law, which will provide maximum protection for the American people,\u201d Mr. McConnell said this week.\nStill, to become law, any such legislation would require 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster, the acquiescence of House Democrats and ultimately the signature of Mr. Trump.\nWhile the N.S.A. phone records system is currently not operational, in 2018 the F.B.I. used the expiring business records provisions to obtain 56 court orders to gather business records in national security investigations.\nMaggie Haberman contributed reporting.\nNicholas Fandos is a national reporter based in the Washington bureau.

Each twinkle is a marker of attendance and a plea for freedom. The demonstrators, some clad in masks to thwart the government\u2019s network of facial recognition cameras, find safety in numbers.\nBut in addition to the bright lights, each phone is also emitting another beacon in the darkness \u2014 one that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. This signal is captured and collected, sometimes many times per minute, not by a drone but by smartphone apps. The signal keeps broadcasting, long after the protesters turn off their camera lights, head to their homes and take off their masks.\nIn the United States, and across the world, any protester who brings a phone to a public demonstration is tracked and that person\u2019s presence at the event is duly recorded in commercial datasets. At the same time, political parties are beginning to collect and purchase phone location for voter persuasion.\n\u201cWithout question it\u2019s sinister,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, professor of journalism at Columbia University and former president of Students for a Democratic Society, a prominent activist group in the 1960s. \u201cIt will chill certain constitutionally permitted expressions. If people know they\u2019ll be tracked, it will certainly make them think twice before linking themselves to a movement.\u201d\nA trove of location data with more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans obtained by Times Opinion helps to illustrate the risks that such comprehensive monitoring poses to the right of Americans to assemble and participate in a healthy democracy.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nWithin minutes, with no special training and a little bit of Google searching, Times Opinion was able to single out and identify individuals at public demonstrations large and small from coast to coast.\nBy tracking specific devices, we followed demonstrators from the 2017 Women\u2019s March back to their homes. We were able to identify individuals at the 2017 Inauguration Day Black Bloc protests. It was easy to follow them to their workplaces. In some instances \u2014 for example, a February clash between antifascists and far-right supporters of Milo Yiannopolous in Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 it took little effort to identify the homes of protesters and then their family members.\nThe anonymity of demonstrators has long been a contentious issue. Governments generally don\u2019t like the idea for fear that masked protesters might be more likely to incite riots. Several states, including New York and Georgia, have laws that prohibit wearing masks at public demonstrations. Countries including Canada and Spain have rules to limit or prohibit masks at riots or unlawful gatherings. But in the smartphone era \u2014 masked or not \u2014 no one can get lost in a sea of faces anymore.\nImagine the following nightmare scenarios: Governments using location data to identify political enemies at major protests. Prosecutors or the police using location information to intimidate criminal defendants into taking plea deals. A rogue employee at an ad-tech location company sharing raw data with a politically motivated group. A megadonor purchasing a location company to help bolster political targeting abilities for his party and using the information to dox protesters. A white supremacist group breaching the insecure servers of a small location startup and learning the home addresses of potential targets.\nRelated: This Opinion video essay imagines how\nthe civil rights protests might have unfolded if governments had access\nto today's location tracking data.\nLokman Tsui, an activist, researcher and professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told us that third parties that sell this data are a problem because \u201cthe standards to buy this information aren\u2019t that rigorous \u2014 it\u2019s not like the companies have ethical review boards. The university I\u2019m at is able to buy data, and it\u2019s fairly easy to get it. And the kind of data they can buy makes me raise my eyebrows, \u2018Oh, wow, you can buy that?\u2019 Creepy data.\u201d\nThe data doesn\u2019t even need to leak or transfer hands \u2014 its mere existence can have a chilling effect on democratic participation. Word has already spread through the more professional protester circles to leave cellphones at home, toggle them to airplane mode or simply power them off. Many antifascist protesters show up to rallies covering their faces to protect their identities from hate groups, the police and the press. \u201cBut that means you\u2019re only getting the diehards to show.... We tell people don\u2019t bring your phone to protests or if you do, keep GPS off at the very least\u2026 The more secure you are the less able you are to organize,\u201d an antifascist researcher told us. He agreed to be quoted only if we did not reveal his name.\nJoshua Wong, the activist who helped drive Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 Umbrella Movement and is now a key figure in the city\u2019s continuing protests, said that omnipresent tracking has fundamentally changed the democratic protests in Hong Kong. \u201cIn the past, they feel like, if they are not activists or high-profile figures, they are safe from surveillance as they have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have come to realize recently that surveillance poses a threat to them as more are involved in the protest, and even if they are not high-profile, the government would also target them.\u201d\nEven those we identified in the data who were public about their activism were unnerved by their movements\u2019 getting catalogued in databases that can be bought, sold, merged or hacked.\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m happy to protest Trump and have people knowing about it,\u201d said Eric Hensal, who lives in Takoma Park, Md., and appeared in the dataset at a 2016 picket line protest at the Trump Hotel in Washington. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much somebody, say, a state actor could determine just by a travel pattern.

Satellite imagery:\nMicrosoft and DigitalGlobe\nGranular surveillance is still new. But some experts argue the window to define our cultural values around tracking citizens may be closing. Mr. Tsui, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, argued that there are three current competing visions for the internet built by China, the United States and the European Union. China is moving fast and breaking things, including civil rights. The E.U., with its focus on privacy, is making a moral point around surveillance and consent. And the United States, with its powerful tech companies, is caught in the middle, trying to weigh ethical concerns while still pushing forward on innovation for fear of being left behind by China. If China pushes forward, skirting human rights via technology, and the United States follows, Mr. Tsui argued that America could see an uptick in using surveillance, data and artificial intelligence to manipulate and change behavior and direct outcomes. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t end up there,\u201d he said.\nLocation data is already part of the 2020 race for the White House. Political action committees for Republicans and Democrats have invested in location data to target voters based on their interest. For example, companies are enlisting data brokers to help monitor the movements of churchgoers to find conservative-leaning voters and sway their votes.\nIn company documents from 2017, Phunware, a Texas-based technology company, describes the race to collect location data to target voters as a \u201cgold rush,\u201d suggesting that \u201cas soon as the first few political campaigns realize the value of mobile ad targeting for voter engagement, the floodgates will open. Which campaigns will get there first and strike it rich?\u201d\nThe company reportedly signed a deal with American Made Media Consultants, a company set up by the Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to offer location collection services. Phunware touts voters\u2019 smartphones as \u201cthe ultimate voter file.\u201d Its marketing claims that mobile data can tell campaigns \u201ceverything from the device operating system (iOS or Android) to what other apps are on the device, what Wi-Fi networks the device joins and much more. And that doesn\u2019t even cover the information it\u2019s possible to infer, such as gender, age, lifestyle preferences and so on.\u201d\nThese are, of course, just the early days. Much of the political manipulation happening now looks no different from serving up a standard political ad at the right moment. The future, however, could get dark quickly. Political candidates rich in location data could combine it with financial information and other personally identifiable details to build deep psychographic profiles designed to manipulate and push voters in unseen directions. Would-be autocrats or despots could leverage this information to misinform or divide voters and keep political enemies from showing up to the polls on election day.\nThen, once in power, they could leverage their troves of data to intimidate activists and squash protests. Those brave enough to rebel might be tracked and followed to their homes. At the very least, their names could be put into registries.\nPublic dissent could quickly become too risky a proposition, given that the record of one\u2019s attendance at a rally could be held against them at a later date. Big Data, once the domain of marketers, could become a means to elevate dictators to power and then frustrate attempts to remove them.\nIt is not difficult, in other words, to imagine a system of social control arising from infrastructure built for advertising. That\u2019s why regulation is critical. \u201cIt is very clear from the examples of the intersection of authoritarianism and surveillance that we\u2019ve seen around the world that a privacy bill of rights is absolutely necessary,\u201d said Edward Markey, the Massachusetts senator who wrote the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. \u201cPrivacy needs to start being seen as a human right.\u201d\nCarlo Ratti, a professor at M.I.T. and director of its Senseable City Lab, echoed the senator\u2019s concerns. \u201cThe present path is untenable,\u201d he told us. \u201cIf you have asymmetrical control of information, it is very dangerous. Whether it\u2019s companies or states, they can crush political opponents before they can band together. If we go this route, it is very dangerous and very volatile.\u201d\nIf Hong Kong has taught the world anything, it is that surveillance systems, once in place, are nearly impossible to uproot.\n\u201cI think Hong Kong citizens are worried that they are retroactively surveilled,\u201d Mr. Wong, the activist, said. \u201cAs there are more reports revealing the effort and attempts of Beijing in monitoring its people, Hong Kong-ers are worried that they have been subjected to the same treatment.\u201d\nOver time, protest could become the exclusive right of those with the means to safeguard themselves technologically, including having a second, \u201cburner\u201d phone. \u201cIt\u2019s technologically possible to be anonymous, but it\u2019s hard,\u201d Mr. Tsui told us. \u201cYou can only protect privacy with tech right now, and so only those who have money and knowledge can do it. But privacy is not just for the rich or geeks. Privacy is for everyone.\u201d\nEven in non-authoritarian countries, the future of unfettered mobile surveillance seems likely to force dissenters into difficult decisions. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019s two directions this could all go. It could force people to embrace the danger of full exposure,\u201d the antifascist researcher and protester said. \u201cOr things go way underground. And things continue to heat up. It forces governments and other organizations to get more and more militant toward each other.\u201d\nThe future for the world\u2019s activists may look increasingly like Hong Kong. The leaderless protest movement of the past six months has been made possible by technology. The messageboard LIHKG and encrypted chat apps like Telegram have allowed for the kind of organization that has kept the protests going. But the movement has also been undermined by the very same technology. Protesters and journalists and even law enforcement have been doxxed (had their private information published) by the thousands. A real-time location tracking app used by protesters to identify the positions of law enforcement was taken down by Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 suggesting that governments will have a competitive advantage when it comes to the resource.\nAnd while protesters have rebelled by wearing masks, blocking government cameras with lasers and even tearing down lampposts they suspected were outfitted with beacons and surveillance equipment, their efforts are being quietly undermined by the spies in their pockets. Like the rest of us, they are only as secure as the least secure apps on their phones.\nThe hundreds of thousands of phones that light up the sky in places like Hong Kong are the expression of peaceful opposition to authority. But the inspiring images and the democratic spirit the glittering devices represent only work if the lights are eventually able to vanish.\nCharlie Warzel (charlie.warzel@nytimes.com) is a writer at large for Opinion.

We cannot stand by and do nothing in the face of moral atrocities. But we should exercise that responsibility first and foremost through a foreign policy that prioritizes diplomacy to prevent or end conflicts and atrocities, including by reaffirming an international order that protects and values human rights around the world. In extremely rare circumstances, there may be a role for humanitarian intervention \u2014 when limited in duration, with clear objectives, authorized by Congress, within U.S. capabilities, and conducted in cooperation with partners and allies and in compliance with applicable international law.\nYes.

The Democratic candidates frequently criticize such actions, but they have been less clear on the circumstances in which they would consider military force justifiable.\nWould you consider military force to pre-empt an Iranian or North Korean nuclear or missile test?\nwarren's Answer\nNo. Using force against a nuclear power or high-risk adversary carries immense risk for broader conflict. Using force when not necessary can be dangerously counterproductive.

But I will not use force to protect oil supplies.

Iran\nIn 2015, the Obama administration signed a deal with Iran that lifted sanctions in exchange for significant limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Many Republicans fiercely objected to the deal, saying it was not tough enough, and in 2018, President Trump abandoned it and reinstated sanctions. But Iran kept up its end of the agreement until last month, when Mr. Trump ordered the killing of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani. The killing of General Suleimani brought the United States to the brink of war with Iran, which retaliated by attacking two military bases that American forces were using in Iraq.\nWhat would you do with the now-abandoned Iranian nuclear deal, as negotiated in 2015?\nwarren's Answer\nI would re-enter the deal with no new preconditions.\nI would re-enter the deal with no new preconditions.\nRead full answer\n2.

His administration has produced no evidence of imminent threat and made no meaningful attempt at a legal justification. There was no prior consultation with Congress, and no serious thought put into the potential consequences for our troops and our country \u2014 or even for the president\u2019s own stated strategies in the region.

What would your diplomatic strategy be?\nwarren's Answer\nThe first thing we need to do is de-escalate and reopen channels of communication with Iran, using the P5+1 and other interlocutors. The best way to do that is to start by negotiating the re-entry of the United States and Iran into the J.C.P.O.A. if that is still possible. If the crisis and conflict President Trump has chosen to create make re-entry into the J.C.P.O.A. impossible, we can still lead with diplomacy and pursue interim confidence-building agreements that focus on our most pressing strategic priority in the region: constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThe first thing we need to do is de-escalate and reopen channels of communication with Iran, using the P5+1 and other interlocutors.

North Korea\nDismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear program has long been an American priority, and President Trump has tried to do so through unusual means: direct diplomacy with the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. It started in Singapore in 2018 but began to fall apart last February, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim emerged from a summit meeting in Vietnam empty-handed. In the interim, sanctions have remained, the North\u2019s arsenal of weapons fuel and missiles has steadily expanded, and Mr. Kim recently threatened to resume missile tests.\nWould you continue the personal diplomacy President Trump began with Kim Jong-un?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. I would be willing to meet with Kim if it advances substantive negotiations, but not as a vanity project. Any summit must be part of a clear strategy, with substantive agreement already reached at the working level, and developed in close coordination with our allies and partners.\nYes.

While it makes sense to periodically review with our allies whether our force posture is appropriately tailored to the changing security environment, our troop presence in South Korea should not be a matter for negotiation with the North.\nNo. Our presence on the Korean Peninsula is in our own strategic interest as a Pacific nation, vital for protecting our trade and investments and promoting democracy and human rights.

North Korea\nDismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear program has long been an American priority, and President Trump has tried to do so through unusual means: direct diplomacy with the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. It started in Singapore in 2018 but began to fall apart last February, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim emerged from a summit meeting in Vietnam empty-handed. In the interim, sanctions have remained, the North\u2019s arsenal of weapons fuel and missiles has steadily expanded, and Mr. Kim recently threatened to resume missile tests.\nPlease describe your North Korea strategy further.\nwarren's Answer\nAs a first step, and in coordination with our partners and allies, I would seek a strong, verifiable agreement that keeps North Korea from expanding its nuclear or missile arsenal or proliferating to other countries. An interim agreement would open the door to negotiations to reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles, control conventional weapons, and address the regime\u2019s crimes against humanity. Denuclearization negotiations should also run in parallel with efforts to further dialogue between South Korea and North Korea and work towards a stable security architecture for the peninsula. A real diplomatic strategy to deal with North Korea is not only an imperative for our national security, it is the only credible path toward denuclearization.\nOur goal should be the full elimination of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and peace on the Korean Peninsula. But while we work toward those long-term goals, we must take pragmatic steps to reduce the threat now.\nWe need serious, realistic negotiations to address this threat.

Afghanistan\nThe war in Afghanistan, begun after the Sept. 11 attacks, is the longest war in United States history, and documents released in December revealed that three successive presidential administrations misled the American people about the progress \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 being made on the ground. That the United States should withdraw has become a rare point of agreement between President Trump and Democrats. But there are still significant disagreements over when, and under what conditions, that withdrawal should happen.\nWould American troops be in Afghanistan at the end of your first term? If so, would you limit those troops' mission to counterterrorism and intelligence gathering?\nwarren's Answer\nNo. We have been in Afghanistan for 18 years with diminishing returns for our own security \u2014 we\u2019ve 'turned the corner' so many times it seems we\u2019re now going in circles. Expecting a military victory when a political settlement is required is unfair to our military, and unfair to the Afghan people. It's long past time to bring our troops home, and I would begin to do so immediately.\nNo. We have been in Afghanistan for 18 years with diminishing returns for our own security \u2014 we\u2019ve 'turned the corner' so many times it seems we\u2019re now going in circles.

But there are still significant disagreements over when, and under what conditions, that withdrawal should happen.\nWould American presence in Afghanistan be dependent on other nations contributing troops on the ground?\nwarren's Answer\nNo. The only time Article 5 of the NATO charter has been invoked was when the United States was attacked on 9/11. Our NATO partners and others have worked side-by-side with U.S. forces in Afghanistan \u2014 hundreds have been killed and many more wounded.

I would begin to withdraw troops immediately, and at the same time I would engage in serious diplomacy to achieve our counterterrorism goals, including negotiating a sustainable political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban. I would also refocus on intelligence efforts, law enforcement, and international partnerships to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States, whether they originate from home or abroad.\nIt\u2019s time to give up the false idea that keeping troops in Afghanistan endlessly makes Americans safer.

These tools have been enormously successful in preventing attacks against the U.S. since 9/11 \u2014 and vastly more effective and less costly than occupying countries.\nIf Afghans make the hard decisions required to achieve peace among themselves, we should support them. Redirecting just a small fraction of the tens of billions of dollars we currently spend on military operations toward economic development and education, for example, would be a more sustainable investment in Afghanistan\u2019s stability than our current perpetuation of endless war.

Israel\nIn Israel, a two-state solution \u2014 long viewed as the only workable end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 appears more distant than ever after President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced a plan that appeared to tilt the outcome in Israel\u2019s favor. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in 2018 to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was deeply polarizing. So is the B.D.S. (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement, which has grown increasingly prominent and which the House condemned in a bipartisan resolution last year.\nShould the United States maintain its current level of military aid to Israel? If not, how should the level of aid change?\nwarren's Answer\nIsrael is an important ally, and I am committed to Israel\u2019s security and safety, and to working together to combat shared threats. But it is also critical to preserve the viability of the two-state solution. In some cases, this may mean finding ways to apply pressure and create consequences for problematic behavior by both parties, as previous Democratic and Republican presidents have done.\nIsrael is an important ally, and I am committed to Israel\u2019s security and safety, and to working together to combat shared threats.

Today, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and the increasing normalization of proposals for Israel to annex parts or all of the West Bank are the most immediate dangers to the two-state solution. I will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s new policy on settlements, which upends 40 years of bipartisan precedent, and make clear that Israeli settlements violate international law.

I would also make clear that in a two-state agreement, both parties should have the option to locate their capitals in Jerusalem \u2014 one for Israel and one for a future Palestinian state.

The fate of Palestinian refugees is one of the core issues of the conflict, and there must be a just settlement negotiated between the two sides. Through prior negotiations, a range of remedies have been developed, including Palestinian refugees returning to the new state of Palestine, obtaining permanent residency or citizenship in the countries where they reside, resettlement in other countries of their choosing, and a negotiated number returning to Israel.

If you answered no, what solution do you envision to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\nwarren's Answer\nA two-state solution is good for U.S. interests, good for Israel's security and its future, and good for Palestinian aspirations for dignity and self-determination. To achieve this, there must be an end to the Israeli occupation and the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip living alongside Israel. As president, I\u2019ll take immediate steps to fix the damage caused by Donald Trump\u2019s reckless policies. I\u2019ll welcome the Palestinian General Delegation back to Washington, because we cannot advance peace when we have closed our channels of communication. I\u2019ll resume aid to the Palestinians that the Trump administration has cut off, because we cannot sustain peace without a future that brings greater freedom, prosperity, and security to the Palestinian people.\nA two-state solution is good for U.S. interests, good for Israel's security and its future, and good for Palestinian aspirations for dignity and self-determination.

Russia\nRussia has been a deeply destabilizing force on the world stage for several years, including through its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its meddling in the United States\u2019 2016 presidential election. After it annexed Crimea, it was suspended from the Group of Eight bloc of industrialized nations (now, in Russia\u2019s absence, the Group of Seven). But President Trump has pushed to readmit Russia to the G-7 and has held several meetings with President Vladimir Putin, the contents of which have not been disclosed.\nIf Russia continues on its current course in Ukraine and other former Soviet states, should the United States regard it as an adversary, or even an enemy?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. Unfortunately, it is clear that Vladimir Putin has decided to treat the U.S. and our allies in Europe as adversaries. In Ukraine, Russia has invaded and occupied the territory of a neighboring sovereign country in violation of international law. Beyond Ukraine, the Kremlin has conducted interference campaigns against U.S. and European democracies, orchestrated cyber attacks against NATO allies, bombed hospitals and civilians to prop up a dictator in Syria, and engaged in covert assassination campaigns in Europe. Domestically, Putin\u2019s Russia has become a corrupt autocratic state that suppresses democracy and violates the human rights of its citizens.

China\nThe Chinese government has been systematically persecuting Muslim minorities: separating families, subjecting Uighurs and Kazakhs to forced labor and operating internment camps. It is also embroiled in a political crisis over Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. At the same time, President Trump has taken a hard line on trade with China, imposing economically damaging tariffs. Last month, the United States and China signed an initial trade deal.\nShould respect for Hong Kong\u2019s political independence, under the terms of the handover agreement with Britain, be a prerequisite for normal relations and trade with China?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. Hong Kong plays a unique role in the global economy and an essential role for China. That role is sustainable only if Hong Kong is allowed to retain its democratic orientation and traditions. China should not expect that foreign governments will look the other way if it fails to live up to the international commitment it made in 1997, or that governments and companies will act as if nothing has changed if Beijing continues to undermine the rule of law that is central to that commitment and to Hong Kong's success as a global financial and commercial center.\nYes.

The Chinese government\u2019s cruel, bigoted treatment of Muslims and ethnic minorities is a horrifying violation of human rights and international law. I have supported efforts to respond strongly to these acts, including export controls on technology used for surveillance of China\u2019s Muslim communities and targeted sanctions on those who are directly responsible for these policies of oppression. My trade plan also requires that countries uphold internationally recognized human rights as a precondition for any trade agreement with America.\nYes.

NATO\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance among 29 North American and European countries, has been a linchpin of the United States\u2019 foreign policy for decades. But President Trump has often criticized the alliance, arguing that the United States gives too much and gets too little from it. During his 2016 campaign, he refused to commit to NATO\u2019s central pledge \u2014 defending other members if they are attacked \u2014 if the members in question had not met their spending commitments, and aides say that in 2018, he repeatedly suggested withdrawing. Last year, NATO agreed to reduce the United States\u2019 contribution and increase Germany\u2019s.\nShould NATO nations pay more for defense than their current commitment of at least 2 percent of G.D.P.?\nwarren's Answer\nNATO defense spending levels should not be about arbitrary spending targets. They will be about capabilities. I will build on what President Obama started by insisting on increased contributions to NATO operations and common investments in collective military capabilities. If requirements change and more than 2 percent is required, then our European allies should spend more. But if the needs of the alliance can be met investing at or less than 2 percent, then allies should spend what is needed. I will also recognize the varied and significant ways that European states contribute to global security \u2014 deploying troops to shared missions, receiving refugees and providing development assistance at some of the highest per capita rates in the world.\nNATO defense spending levels should not be about arbitrary spending targets.

Cyber Policy\nCyber weaponry has emerged as the primary way nations compete with and undercut each other in short-of-war conflict. Yet there are few international rules that govern the daily battles \u2014 or prevent escalation. As a shadow war emerges in cyberspace, President Trump has given far more powers to the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency.\nShould a presidential order be required to launch a cyber strike against another country, just as it is required to launch a nuclear strike?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. The same laws, values, and oversight under which the United States pursues military action should be consistently applied across domains. Any such activity should be subject to careful deliberation by the president and her advisors and the strict oversight of Congress \u2014 including offensive operations in cyberspace that rise to the level of a use of force or armed attack.\nYes.

Would you continue this policy?\nwarren's Answer\nD.O.D.\u2019s strategy of \"persistent engagement\" and defending forward to disrupt cyber threats can be a part of defending U.S. national security, but it must be paired with adequate investment in cyber security to strengthen our defenses, make attacks by our adversaries less effective, and bolster the resilience of our critical infrastructure.

Cyber Policy\nCyber weaponry has emerged as the primary way nations compete with and undercut each other in short-of-war conflict. Yet there are few international rules that govern the daily battles \u2014 or prevent escalation. As a shadow war emerges in cyberspace, President Trump has given far more powers to the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency.\nIf you answered yes to the last question, would you nevertheless insist that other nations pursuing \u201cpersistent engagement\u201d could not be inside American power grids and other critical infrastructure?\nwarren's Answer\nNot applicable.\nNot applicable.\nRead full answer\n10. National Security Strategy\nIn the post-Cold War era \u2014 and especially after the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 the focal point of American foreign policy moved to counterterrorism, the Middle East and Afghanistan. President Trump has, at least on paper, argued for shifting American foreign policy back to confront the \u201crevisionist powers\u201d of Russia and China.\nPresident Trump\u2019s national security strategy calls for shifting the focus of American foreign policy away from the Middle East and Afghanistan, and back to what it refers to as the \u201crevisionist\u201d superpowers, Russia and China. Do you agree? Why or why not?\nwarren's Answer\nDespite his campaign claims and his national security strategy, President Trump has in fact sent more troops to the Middle East and has now brought us to the brink of war with Iran. We need to end America\u2019s wars in the Middle East, not start new ones. Both China and Russia have invested heavily in their militaries and other tools of national power. Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image and ultimately remake the global order to suit their own priorities. But confronting this challenge is not solely or even primarily a question of military competition, nor should the United States seek a military conflict that would be devastating for all involved.\nDespite his campaign claims and his national security strategy, President Trump has in fact sent more troops to the Middle East and has now brought us to the brink of war with Iran.

Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image and ultimately remake the global order to suit their own priorities. But confronting this challenge is not solely or even primarily a question of military competition, nor should the United States seek a military conflict that would be devastating for all involved. China uses its economic might to throw its weight around on the world stage, for instance, while Russia has prioritized opportunistic harassment and covert attacks. And beyond China and Russia, we face challenges, such as cyberattacks and nuclear proliferation, that require much more than a strong military to combat. Other challenges, like climate change, cannot be solved through military action at all.\nAddressing these challenges requires prioritization. That starts with cutting our bloated defense budget \u2014 identifying which programs actually benefit American security and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. It also requires us to reinvest in diplomacy and other tools of national power \u2014 because funding a muscular military without robust diplomacy, economic statecraft, support for civil society, and development assistance only hamstrings American national power and undercuts any military gains.\nLastly, with American power increasingly challenged from within and without, we can no longer afford to think of our domestic agenda as separate from our foreign policy. Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve our national security. A stronger economy, a healthier democracy and a united people \u2014 these are the engines that power our country, and these are the investments that will project American strength and values in the world well into the 21st century.\nRead full answer\n11. Top Diplomatic Priority\nThe next president will be confronted with an array of foreign policy challenges, from North Korea\u2019s nuclear program to international efforts to combat climate change. It will not be possible to address all of them at once. This makes it essential to understand not only the candidates\u2019 policies, but also their priorities.\nWhat would be your top priority for your secretary of state?\nwarren's Answer\nThe first priority for a new secretary of state must be to address the threat posed by climate change to the United States and the world. But to make progress on climate change, we will need to rebuild relations with our allies and partners. In fact, all of the challenges we face \u2014 from climate change to nonproliferation to the need for international norms in space and cyberspace \u2014 require a multilateral approach to solve. Our network of partnerships and alliances is one of America\u2019s unique strengths, and we are stronger together than we are apart.\nThe first priority for a new secretary of state must be to address the threat posed by climate change to the United States and the world.

I have a plan to revitalize the State Department, and I will appoint a secretary capable of implementing it. The American people deserve the world\u2019s best diplomatic institution to protect American interests around the world.\nRead full answer", "article":

"year": 2019, "title": "Total Surveillance Is Not What America Signed Up For", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/21/opinion/location-data-privacy-rights.html", "text_content": "Total Surveillance Is Not What America Signed Up For\nIt is a federal crime to open a piece of junk mail that\u2019s addressed to someone else. Listening to someone else\u2019s phone call without a court order can also be a federal crime.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the location data served up by mobile phones is also covered by constitutional protections. The government can\u2019t request it without a warrant.\nBut the private sector doesn\u2019t need a warrant to get hold of your data. There\u2019s little to prevent companies from tracking the precise movements of hundreds of millions of Americans and selling copies of that dataset to anyone who can pay the price.\nThe incongruity between the robust legal regime around legacy methods of privacy invasion and the paucity of regulation around more comprehensive and intrusive modern technologies has come into sharp relief in an investigation into the location data industry by Times Opinion. The investigation, which builds on work last year by The Times\u2019s newsroom, was based on a dataset provided to Times Opinion by sources alarmed by the power of the tracking industry. The largest such file known to have been examined by journalists, it reveals more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans across several major cities.\nBy analyzing these pings, our journalists were able to track the movements of President Trump\u2019s Secret Service guards and of senior Pentagon officials. They could follow protesters to their homes and stalk high-school students across Los Angeles. In most cases, it was child\u2019s play for them to connect a supposedly anonymous data trail to a name and an address \u2014 to a real live human being.\nYour smartphone can broadcast your exact location thousands of times per day, through hundreds of apps, instantaneously to dozens of different companies. Each of those companies has the power to follow individual mobile phones wherever they go, in near-real time.\nThat\u2019s not a glitch in the system. It is the system.\nIf the government ordered Americans to continuously provide such precise, real-time information about themselves, there would be a revolt. Members of Congress would trample one another to be first in front of the cable news cameras to quote the founders and insist on our rights to be free of such pervasive surveillance.\nYet, as a society, without ever focusing on this profound choice, we\u2019ve reached a tacit consensus to hand this data over voluntarily, even though we don\u2019t really know who\u2019s getting it or what they\u2019re doing with it. As the close of 2019 approaches, everybody is searching for the meaning of the decade. Here\u2019s a thought: This is the decade \u2014 the period since the founding of the App Store, in 2008 \u2014 in which we were brainwashed into surveilling ourselves.\nRelated: From Adam Westbrook of The New York Times Opinion Video\nFeaturing NYT columnist Farhad Manjoo and contributing opinion writer Kara Swisher.\nTo be clear: The fact that Americans are tracked by the millions is not consumers\u2019 fault. There is no good-faith \u201copt out\u201d when it comes to smartphone tracking. While there are steps that smartphone users can take to minimize the information gathered about their behavior, Americans who use surveillance devices like smartphones have only the illusion of control when it comes to protecting their privacy.\nLocation data collection is only one aspect of a surveillance economy that has sneaked into every corner of modern life. Tech companies have fostered a grass-roots surveillance culture that has convinced millions of Americans that they live better when they buy smart speakers, carry smart phones, watch smart televisions, turn their doorbells into unblinking video cameras.\nThere\u2019s no question that consumers, and society as a whole, receive many benefits from surrendering so much information, including better traffic mapping apps, more targeted advertisements and reviews of nearby restaurants. In the future, smarter artificial intelligence, safer self-driving cars and better medical care may also rely on location data. But there\u2019s no reason that data needs to be gathered surreptitiously, stored forever in a manner that puts privacy at risk and allowed to be sold to the highest bidder.\nThe dangers inherent in today\u2019s smartphones and their near-universal adoption become obvious when you consider the enormity of the information being collected and how intimate it can be: a record of people visiting drug treatment centers, strip clubs, casinos, abortion clinics or other places where social stigma can create a powerful desire for privacy. The data we reviewed also reveals Americans making routine commutes from suburban homes to secret government facilities and making trips to churches and synagogues, to counseling sessions and chemotherapy treatments.\nGiven the far richer and more detailed data files available for pay, the dataset used in our series is comparatively tiny, a fleeting look under the curtain at the most expansive corporate surveillance advertising system ever constructed. It\u2019s all perfectly legal, largely unregulated and built to turn a profit.\nAs the protesters in Hong Kong who cut down high-tech lampposts to remove the threat of facial recognition cameras illustrate, uprooting a technology from society is far more difficult than regulating it before it achieves universal adoption. Location tracking through smartphones is already a reality for most Americans. But putting basic protections in place can still better protect the privacy of a nation of digital citizens while permitting innovation.\nIf the industry believes that data is a gold mine, Congress ought to force it to adopt practices to treat data in a manner commensurate with its value. That means increased security. It means rules clear and understandable to consumers about how it will be used. It means strict oversight of data collection, with penalties for deceiving consumers. It means further restrictions on collecting and monetizing the data of minors. It also means regulations that allow Americans to see where their data goes.\nSome state and federal privacy laws apply to data that qualifies as \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d that is, information that could be used to identify a particular person, like full names, Social Security numbers and home addresses. Data classified as personally identifiable is subject to regulations that can restrict its distribution and sale, with penalties for violations.\nSince there is no uniform federal definition of personally identifiable information, the states have created their own, with sometimes conflicting results. For instance, Massachusetts and California regard ZIP codes as personally identifiable, while other states do not. Federal lawmakers ought to classify location data as personally identifiable. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress over the years that would do just this, though they haven\u2019t made it into law. But even the notion of personally identifiable information is becoming outdated since, as the Times Opinion investigation shows, so much can now be inferred from supposedly anonymous data.\nSo, as Congress considers federal privacy legislation, lawmakers could include measures to prevent the acquisition of location data if such collection isn\u2019t central to the function of the service. For instance, flashlight apps wouldn\u2019t be able to track location. A central principle of the General Data Protection Regulation, which governs privacy across the European Union, is \u201cpurpose limitation,\u201d meaning that data collected for one purpose cannot be used for another. The United States lacks such a protection \u2014 even California\u2019s new privacy law, which comes into force next year, doesn\u2019t have a purpose limitation provision.\nEven in the absence of congressional action, regulators could be taking steps to better safeguard privacy. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, could scrutinize data collection methods to see if they constitute deceptive practices under existing law.\nThe 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act provides assurances that children under 13 will not be surveilled by websites and technology companies without their parents\u2019 permission. But it is difficult if not impossible for parents to understand the scope of the data being collected about their children and the stakes of having that information bought and sold. And why are the protections only for children under 13? In other ways, our laws recognize that teenagers up to 18 deserve special protections. Lawmakers should insist on regulations that prevent companies from surveilling the movement of all minors.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nThough studies show Americans are pleased by the convenience afforded by technological progress, many are either unsure or overwhelmed by the trade-off. If lawmakers don\u2019t act, we risk the further entrenchment of corporate surveillance in our lives.\nIt is time for Congress to hold technology and advertising companies accountable and make opting out of tracking a meaningful choice, if not the default setting. In a Capitol split by impeachment, the subject of privacy is a rare point of bipartisan concern, if not consensus.\n\u201cIt doesn't have to be this way,\u201d said Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri. \u201cThe reason it is this way is because the public is being actively misled by these tech companies when they tell the public that they can opt out. But the public can't opt out.\u201d Mr. Hawley has introduced \u2014 and attracted Democratic co-sponsors for \u2014 do-not-track legislation that would block collection of data not central to the functioning of an online service or app.\n\u201cThere is a Dickensian quality about this moment: the best and worst of times for this technology, which can enable and ennoble and degrade and debase,\u201d said Edward Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. \u201cFor years, technology companies have talked about the enabling and ennobling. Now we\u2019re starting to see the degrading and the debasement.\u201d\nWhat Times Opinion has been able to show in this series reflects just a tiny fraction of the data collected from the average American on any given day. The American public should see the full scope of the corporate surveillance to which it is subjected. Lawmakers have the power to subpoena companies and demand transparency about what data they collect from American citizens and what happens to it.\nThe price of participating in modern society cannot be turning our lives into open books, diaries of all travels and relationships and wants and desires to be read and passed along by corporations \u2014 corporations that are themselves not monitored or tracked in any meaningful way. Americans need to know how their information is being gathered, and whether it is being used to manipulate them. They deserve the freedom to choose a life without surveillance.\nLike other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

Many of the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreaks took root in and around well-traveled cities, but they have since grown to encompass entire countries.\nCases have spread across Italy\u2019s north and down to Rome, leading to a lockdown of the entire country. Iran\u2019s capital, where leaders dismissed the virus just two weeks ago, has seen thousands infected. And cases continue to surge across Europe.\n|New cases in past week||Total cases||Cases per 100k residents|\n|Italy||24,122||27,980||45|\n|Iran||11,478||14,991||18|\n|Spain||7,494||7,753||16|\n|France||6,253||6,633||10|\n|Germany||5,530||6,012||8|\n|South Korea||1,781||7,869||16|\nThe outbreaks are not all heading in the same direction. South Korea has managed to slow growth of new cases for now, through intensive testing and monitoring of infections. Italy, Iran and the United States are still reporting large numbers of new cases every day.\nOfficial case totals are an imperfect method of judging the world\u2019s outbreaks. Every country has more cases than it has been able to detect through lab tests. And a shortage of testing kits in some countries, like Indonesia and the United States, along with a lack of public disclosure in others, like Egypt, means official reports are probably masking large outbreaks.\nHere\u2019s the extent of some of the largest outbreaks in the world and information on how these countries are trying to slow the spread of the virus.\nItaly\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nHUNGARY\nBergamo\n2,365+\nSWITZERLAND\nMilan\n1,305+\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780+\nSERBIA\nCROATIA\nFRANCE\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nPadua\n520+\n480+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n250+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\nFlorence\n100+\n155+\nAncona\nITALY\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nBari\nITALY\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nCatania\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nMilan\n1,305+\nHUNGARY\nBergamo\n2,365+\nSWITZERLAND\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780+\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nPadua\n520+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n480+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\nFlorence\n100+\n155+\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n315+\n50 MILES\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nBergamo\n2,365\nHUNGARY\nSWITZERLAND\nMilan\n1,305+\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n480+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\n155+\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nLodi 1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nMilan\n1,305+\nBergamo 2,365\nHUNGARY\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia 1,780+\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n360+\n495+\nFlorence\n100+\nPiacenza\n705+\nITALY\nCremona\n1,340+\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nWith more than 17,000 confirmed cases, Italy has reported the largest outbreak outside of China. Italian authorities first put restrictions in place in the northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak first accelerated, before moving on Monday to restrict the movement and end public gatherings for all 60 million citizens in the country. At least 1,000 people have died because of the virus.\nOn Wednesday, the government shut down basically all commercial activities, including bars and restaurants. Supermarkets, pharmacies and newstands can remain open. All schools are closed until at least April 3. But Italy\u2019s nationwide lockdown, the first in Europe, is not a severe ban on movement like the one put in place in Wuhan, China. Italians are still able to move around for work, to buy groceries and other essentials, and for reasons having to do with health, child or senior care. Police checkpoints have been set up around the country, at which people are required to stop and fill out official forms explaining their movements.\nThe number of new cases in Italy had steadily increased for more than a week before dropping on Tuesday. On that day, though, there were still almost 1,000 new cases.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Italy each day\nItaly is aggressively testing for the virus, which could help explain why its total confirmed cases are higher than some other countries in Europe. On Tuesday, more than 60,000 tests had been performed, more than twice as many tests as the United Kingdom had done.\n\u201cToday, the red zone is Italy,\u201d Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, told The New York Times. But in 10 days, he warned, it will be Madrid, Paris and Berlin. If Italy cannot show how to stop the virus, he said, \u201cthe red zone will be Europe.\u201d\nSouth Korea\nNORTH\nKOREA\nSeoul\n220+\nIncheon\n25+\nChungnam\nprovince\n110+\nSOUTH\nKOREA\nGyeongbuk province\n1,145+\nDaegu\n5,900+\nGyeongnam\nprovince\n80+\nBusan\n95+\n50 MILES\nJAPAN\nNORTH\nKOREA\nSeoul\n220+\nIncheon\n25+\nChungnam\nprovince\n110+\nSOUTH\nKOREA\nGyeongbuk\nprovince\n1,145+\nDaegu\n5,900+\nGyeongnam\nprovince\n80+\nBusan\n95+\n50 MILES\nNORTH\nKOREA\nIncheon\n25+\nSeoul\n220+\nChungnam\nprovince\n110+\nSOUTH\nKOREA\nGyeongbuk\nprovince\n1,145+\nDaegu\n5,900+\nGyeongnam\nprovince\n80+\nBusan\n95+\n50 MILES\nNORTH\nKOREA\nSeoul\n220+\nIncheon\n25+\nChungnam\nprovince\n110+\nSOUTH\nKOREA\nGyeongbuk province\n1,145+\nDaegu\n5,900+\nGyeongnam\nprovince\n80+\nBusan\n95+\nJAPAN\n50 MILES\nIn contrast to most other countries, South Korea\u2019s reports of new cases have begun to slow \u2014 at least for now. Unlike other countries with major outbreaks, South Korea, with a population of 50 million, has not outright restricted the movement of its citizens and has instead focused on aggressively monitoring for infections. More than 7,900 cases and 66 deaths have been reported.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in South Korea each day\nMore than 235,000 people have been tested, and health officials carefully track down people who may have symptoms, testing more than 10,000 people each day. The government even opened drive-through testing centers. While health officials are battling smaller clusters of infections in other cities, much of the effort has focused on Daegu, the center of the outbreak, where many people were infected in a large church congregation.\nHealth officials also introduced aggressive public awareness campaigns, sending out mobile phone alerts to citizens whenever a new case is reported in their districts. Updates are provided on government websites and mobile apps as to how many people have been tested and where, along with brief sketches on each patient: their gender, how they became infected and where they are being treated, as well as which places they visited before testing positive.\nOfficials have advised against holding large gatherings, like outdoor rallies and religious services.

Now, with the total number of cases standing at more than 11,000, and with more than 400 people dead, Iran is scrambling to control one of the worst outbreaks in the world.\nThe virus started in the holy city of Qom, where thousands of pilgrims from Iran and around the Middle East travel each day. Two days after the first deaths and cases of the virus were reported in Qom, Iran held parliamentary elections, which are widely believed to have been the cause of the virus spreading to other provinces.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Iran each day\nThe authorities failed to take protective measures at this early stage. But the problem became impossible to ignore after nearly three dozen Iranian government officials and members of parliament were infected, and a senior adviser to the supreme leader died.\nNow, Friday prayers are cancelled, and schools and universities are closed until mid-April. Government offices remain open, but employees must work reduced hours. For everyone else, officials are asking people to leave their homes only when necessary.\nA severe shortage of testing kits in Iran means the spread of the virus is likely much higher than reported. One study projected a week ago that the true total of infections may have been more than 18,000, \u201cand a week ago is eons when we are talking about an epidemic,\u201d said Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto doctor who is a co-author of that study.\nSee our maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world.\nSee our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.",

She served as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor.\nThis interview with Ms. Hochul was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times on May 31.\nRead the board\u2019s endorsement for the Democratic gubernatorial primary here.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Thank you, Governor, for coming today. We, as you can tell, are going to have some colleagues on the screen and then, of course, in the room. I wanted to start actually by just talking a little bit about what you see as your signature issue as governor. Give us the one-minute version of what your vision is and the impact that you want to have as governor.\nYeah, I\u2019ve quickly become a crisis manager. Stepping into the job unexpectedly. Difficult circumstances. The state was in turmoil. So much had not occurred that should have occurred in the previous months. So I had to step in and start fixing things. And that meant getting $2 billion out for excluded workers, a billion dollars for people who needed to get directly. All of this was jammed up when I took office. Had to deal with not one but two hurricanes and the cleanup in the aftermath of the loss of 13 lives.Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding across New York, including in the Queens neighborhood of East Elmhurst. In New York City, at least 13 people died, most of whom were trapped in flooded basement apartments. Many others lost their homes to the destruction. And I\u2019ve been dealing with the pandemic at the same time as the numbers started going up, and we had to adapt our response, vaccine mandates, not mandates, masks in schools. So we had a lot of decisions.\nBut I\u2019ve learned about myself, even more so, and my leadership style. It\u2019s collaborative, but it\u2019s very decisive. You know, I see a problem, I tackle it, I move on, because there\u2019s always another one right behind it. So my signature approach is to realize that the core of everything I do, my job is to protect New Yorkers. I have to protect them from crime. I have to protect them from Covid. I have to protect them from losing their homes. I have to protect them from losing their jobs when they didn\u2019t have child care. So I feel a moral responsibility as a leader of this state to protect New Yorkers in every way I can.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Five years from now, assuming you are elected, what do you want your legacy to be? What do you, what is the thing that you hope \u2014 I mean, of course, dealing with the crisis, day-to-day crises is important \u2014 but what do you hope to use this platform that you have to accomplish?\nI\u2019d hope in five years and even beyond that history will judge this time, judge me on how we brought the state and the city back after the pandemic. We were the epicenter of the pandemic. We were knocked down to our knees. We still have businesses that are suffering. We still have moms who can\u2019t go back to work because their child care provider doesn\u2019t, isn\u2019t back there anymore. We\u2019ve \u2014 our health care system was brought to its knees.\nThe disparity in outcomes between Black and brown communities and white communities is abhorrent. There were so many things that emerged, and even the educational disparities, the digital divide was so crystal clear to us, and we saw that kids were not learning.\nI talked to a minister up in Harlem who told me he used to go to McDonald\u2019s every morning and take a class \u2014 his wife is a teacher \u2014 take a class of kids and ask, \u201cIf I bought them all breakfast, can they use your internet connection so they can sit here and get some learning in?\u201d That wasn\u2019t happening in Westchester. So I\u2019m angered by that. But I also know that my legacy is that we\u2019re going to try our very best to eradicate all those disparities. I have a commission that\u2019s convening not just to look at the response at the time. We\u2019re not looking to point fingers, but I need to know what went right and went wrong and focus on what went wrong so we fix it. And that\u2019s the challenge we face. And to restore that sense of exceptionalism that we all have as New Yorkers, bring this city back and make people feel proud of it again.\nYou know, I spoke at 9/11 yesterday, the 20th anniversary of when, after 260 days, they closed up and finished the recovery, the rescue-recovery effort. And we talk about how knocked down so hard that no one ever thought that Lower Manhattan would rebuild and come back the way it did. I want the legacy of our administration to be the one that said, \u201cLook, look back at what they did,\u201d 20 years, 30 years, 50 years from now. And I expect to be judged that way.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Mara?\nMara Gay: In a previous political lifetime, you had a very different position on guns. Obviously the country is enmeshed in a very painful conversation around guns. As a member of Congress, you received an endorsement from the N.R.A. You once voted to allow individuals to carry, to conceal and carry.In 2011, when Ms. Hochul was a member of the House of Representatives, she voted for the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, which would have expanded the right to carry concealed firearms across state lines. This would have eroded state authority to determine who is permitted to carry a concealed weapon within its borders. The bill died in the Senate. And then when you became lieutenant governor, your views and constituency certainly changed. What\u2019s really in your heart about guns? Can you talk to us about that?\nI lived in a different culture. In my congressional district, I remember going to a Christmas party. And I was the county clerk before that. I oversaw the pistol permit office. So I, it was, I mean, I ran the D.M.V.s, I ran the court clerks, I ran the land records. One of the responsibilities is running the pistol [inaudible] permit office. And I know how long it took. It took a long time. It took about a year to get a pistol permit, which is another topic. I want to make sure that happens. We\u2019re going to pass the legislation this week.Ms. Hochul signed a comprehensive series of gun-safety bills into law on June 6. One measure raises the age to buy a semiautomatic rifle to 21.\nSo I would go to a Christmas party, and members of the Working Families Party and the Democratic Party would come up to me and say, you know, \u201cHow\u2019s my pistol permit going?\u201d So there was, it was a different culture there, but that was the representation I had then. I\u2019ve evolved dramatically, especially after Sandy Hook. It was 10 years ago, and I said no more.\nI mean, you can\u2019t, if you\u2019re going to fight background checks, something that we did in New York, that\u2019s something I was responsible for \u2014 making sure there were mental health checks and state police checks and neighbor checks. I know what a background check is all about. My office had to conduct them, make sure they were done thoroughly. And we couldn\u2019t do that after the slaughter of first graders at Sandy Hook? So I became converted, in a sense, like not many people have. That evolution is an evolution that we need to have more people have. And I\u2019m the best person to talk about that. And that\u2019s why we have to change the hearts and minds of people right now.\nAnd I was reading an article yesterday about an N.R.A. member who took his \u2014 in Texas \u2014 took his AR-15 and turned it in to the local police department, and he says, I\u2019m done with this. I don\u2019t want to be part of this anymore. We\u2019re at an awakening time. And this is an opportunity for me to lead with bold plans, be nation leading and leave no stone unturned. \u2019Cause I understand the cultural differences. I know the resistance that\u2019s going to be out there, and I can speak that language and help them understand. I understand the Second Amendment, but that doesn\u2019t know how to protect military-style assault weapons or the ability of someone to go to Pennsylvania and to buy a 30 magazine capacity, high-capacity magazine that slaughtered my neighbors in Buffalo. So I\u2019m \u2014 this is a cause for me. This is a cause.\nMara Gay: Do you own a gun?\nNo.\nMara Gay: Did you ever own a gun?\nNo.\nEleanor Randolph: If the Supreme Court rules against the New York law,State law currently requires that people who want a license to carry a gun in public show \u201cproper cause.\u201d how do you see New York getting around that?\nWell, we\u2019re not telegraphing right now because the decision isn\u2019t rendered, and we don\u2019t want anything we say or do to affect that in the sense that \u2026 I want to see what they come down with. We\u2019ve already had a lot of conversation about this. My team, ever since this case went to the Supreme Court, we knew a decision would be rendered literally in June. So we\u2019re prepared, and I\u2019m prepared to call the legislature back to find a way that we believe will legally find a way to allow us to do what we want to do, which is to protect New York.\nThis law, this wasn\u2019t even part of the Safe Act.The first major set of state-level gun bills that was passed after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. This, the law that\u2019s challenged has been in effect since early 1900s. And I had people come in my pistol permit office and ask for concealed carry. We told them no. I mean, unless you\u2019re law enforcement, you know, a security guard or have a reason, we can\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d I don\u2019t want him to be able to walk into the next Tops grocery store in Buffalo with something legally hidden in their pocket. And then we\u2019re Wild West. That\u2019s the Wild West. We\u2019re not going there. So we\u2019ll find a way.\nI\u2019ll call back the legislature, I\u2019ve already put them on notice. Are you ready to adapt your plans? Or maybe it\u2019ll happen soon enough. Well, it hasn\u2019t happened. They\u2019ll be gone Thursday or Friday, so I\u2019ll take whatever. I called them back my first week on the job to deal with the eviction moratorium that, it was supposed to end Sept. 1. I said the money didn\u2019t get out. It\u2019s not their fault. We can\u2019t punish people. All over the country, it all ended Sept. 1. I moved it to Jan. 15. I got the legislature back. So I\u2019m prepared to do the same thing.\nMara Gay: There\u2019s a lot to go over with gun policy. We have so much to cover here. I don\u2019t want to go too deep into the weeds, but could you give us a top-line sense of what could be done to strengthen the state\u2019s red-flag implementation rather than the law? Because the criticism is that the training hasn\u2019t happened, that police departments across the state don\u2019t, aren\u2019t aware of what needs to be done to prevent shootings like what happened in Buffalo.\nWell, you hit right on it. A law doesn\u2019t mean anything if people don\u2019t understand it or that they\u2019re afraid to go too far. I want people to feel \u2014 I\u2019d rather go too far on the front end than afterward, when we connect the dots, say, \u201cOh, that one could have been prevented.\u201d That\u2019s not OK.\nJust a couple of days ago, I convened our intra \u2014 I have an interstate, nine-state group of, dealing with, they\u2019re dealing with gun interdiction, but I brought together everybody in the state and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want us to be in the business of solving crimes. I want us to be in the business of preventing these crimes.\u201d So you have the tools, you know, whether it\u2019s the social media component or whatever, but the red-flag law that I do with executive action. I didn\u2019t even wait for the legislature.\nI told the state police, you will use your judgment. You will understand that your job is to get that extreme protect, order of protection in place when you see the signs that you\u2019ve been trained to. Now that\u2019s my state police. What the law is saying is part of a comprehensive package that we\u2019re working with the legislature to get through this in a couple of days.\nIt\u2019ll require all people to have to follow stricter standards and be looking for. And when a flag comes up, I try to remember the language. I was looking at it late last night. But it\u2019s a lower standard. It\u2019s a lower standard than had been in place before. And the training has to occur, and we\u2019ll take that on. I told my head of state police, \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for this.\u201d I want to make sure that everybody understands, not just law enforcement, schoolteachers, guidance counselors, coaches, parents.\nMara Gay: Just to drill down on that: What specifically is your office doing to ensure that local police departments and local school districts are \u2014\nWe\u2019re requiring them to be trained. We are putting together the training program to do this. We\u2019re doing it right now. And that\u2019s getting out there. I\u2019m very impatient. I\u2019m not waiting for the next mass casualty to happen in our state.\nMara Gay: Thank you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I want to change topics. Nick, do you want to ask about Brian Benjamin?Ms. Hochul\u2019s former lieutenant governor and running mate, who resigned after Manhattan prosecutors brought bribery charges against him.\nNick Fox: Yeah. You\u2019ve been criticized for the vetting of Brian Benjamin, but you didn\u2019t really need to vet him. A Google search would\u2019ve found people who supposedly gave to his campaign and never even heard of him. One of the donors was the 2-year-old grandson of an alleged partner in crime. He had suspicious reimbursements from his campaign for personal expenses, apparently including his wedding celebration. As a state senator, he was paid by his former company and lied about it. He had to resign from the board of another company after he was criticized for working with a major player in the subprime, subprime mortgage crisis. Apparently, it was no secret that he had tax \u2014 why were you in such a hurry to appoint him?\nWe were a state in crisis. We didn\u2019t have leadership. I had to step in. I needed to let people know that I\u2019d also have someone at my side who could step in if necessary. But I\u2019ll tell you, that was, personally, very not just disappointing. It was painful to realize that, you know, there were things, signs that were missed, that more could have been done.\nI had a very small team. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to rely on the Cuomo people to do our vetting for us. I was still lieutenant governor. I was still lieutenant governor. And we had to start the vetting process and to use a very small group of people. And yes, I would say the system did not work. We\u2019ll get it right. We\u2019ll get it right this time. And that is something I take seriously because I made a commitment to New Yorkers when I was sworn in. And I want to restore their faith in government. That was a setback. And I have the responsibility to restore that faith again. And I do believe that, you know, we had more time. I had more resources, more staff. The work that we did to vet my new lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado was, was successful. And as people get to know him, they\u2019ll understand why I selected someone of his caliber.\nNick Fox: I still don\u2019t understand the hurry. I mean, it was about two weeks it took to pick him. There is a constitutional line of succession if you needed a successor, which I [inaudible]. Why did you need to go to a guy that had so many red flags? I can tell you, even when we were considering him in his comptroller campaign, all this stuff came up.\nThe early vetting process did not work. I didn\u2019t personally conduct it, but I take full responsibility for everything that happens. It\u2019s my job as a leader. I was also trying to find a chief of staff and a secretary to the governor and the head of state operations. And I had to get a legal counsel. I had nobody. I had nobody. So I, I rely on people. I identify, I said, I want someone who\u2019s, you know, someone I can trust, someone that\u2019s, I\u2019ve worked with before. I had gone to Harlem many times with Brian Benjamin. I know he was well liked in his district. We spent time together.\nBut I said mistakes were made. And what I\u2019m saying is I understand that. I understand the weight that\u2019s on my shoulders to get it right and never let that happen again. I was able to find Kathryn Garcia to run state operations, Karen Keogh, Liz Fine, you know, Hope Knight to be head of economic development, Adrienne Harris to be head of, you know, the regulator Wall Street unit. And I was focused on diversity. So I have the most diverse \u2014 racially, ethnically but also gender-wise \u2014 administration that the state has ever seen and may ever see in the future. That was, I had to put together an entire team. Who\u2019s going to run my homeland security? I have a hurricane I\u2019m cleaning up after. Who\u2019s running my state operations?\nI mean, it was, it was a time when there was not \u2014 I\u2019m going to accept responsibility. I\u2019ll just do that, because it was not done right. It was enormously, personally disappointing to know that that happened. And it won\u2019t happen again.\nNick Fox: Just one quick thing. Did anyone tell you, \u201cWatch out for this guy\u201d?\nNo. Because \u2014 let me put it this way. Absolutely, if I knew now, knew then what I know now, why would I select someone like that? I was basing on a relationship I had with him independent. I had worked with him in the legislature. I\u2019d gone to his district. I\u2019d gone to events with him. I knew him as a person. I didn\u2019t know this. And no, I didn\u2019t do personal Google searches, and our team failed in that regard. We did not have the information. Or they asked him questions; he answered them satisfactory to the people that were doing it. But I had a very small team. But the buck will always stop with me. I accept that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti, do you want to ask about \u2014\nJyoti Thottam: Cuomo or domestic?\nKathleen Kingsbury: Whichever you would prefer.\nJyoti Thottam: Again, just looking at what you inherited: Governor Cuomo was widely criticized for certain parts of the way he handled the pandemic, specifically nursing homes.A state audit found that health officials under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration concealed the deaths of 4,100 nursing home residents during the first year of the pandemic. So I wanted to ask you what you have done in the years since you\u2019ve taken office to improve that situation to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. And then, just separately, is there anything you would have done differently in your handling of the pandemic?\nWell, the first thing I did very early in my administration was bring in the families who wanted someone to at least acknowledge that they were owed an apology. I brought them in. They have been very vocal in their criticism. And I said, you know, these are human beings who lost a loved one. They lost a parent, lost a grandparent. They lost an uncle. Just bring them in and treat them like human beings. Acknowledge their pain. And vow to do better. And I told him that I would at the right time.\nYou know, we are still dealing with the remnants of Delta. We had a drop for about three weeks, and then we had Omicron. And I watched the numbers like a hawk. It\u2019s the first thing I do every morning. I mean, is there anything happening? What are our hospitals looking like? What are our nursing homes looking like?\nSo we had a difficult situation at a time then, and I\u2019ll give you this other challenge we had in the fall when I was taking on. I wanted health care workers to be vaccinated. I didn\u2019t think that anybody going to a hospital or a nursing home should encounter someone who was supposed to make them healthy who actually could give them the virus. That was more resistance than anything I\u2019ve done yet.\nBut we fought through it. We needed to. We stood firm, and I wanted \u2014 I said, I have to protect the nursing homes. We saw the vulnerability. So every time we had, you know, an effort toward getting more vaccines out and boosters, job No. 1: Get them to the nursing homes. Get them to the nursing homes. No excuses. Call them up. Did they administer them? Did they need help? I literally sent the National Guard into nursing homes. Unprecedented step I took, because we had a shortage of workers once I required that they had to be vaccinated. And secondly, a lot of them were getting sick themselves, and someone is walking off the job. So it was too much.\nSo I had to bring in resources to make sure that this, the most vulnerable population in our state had more protection than anybody. Test kits went there first. Like, I kept the rules in place to make sure we limited visitors for the longest time. And I knew it was painful, but I had to do this to protect them. So having learned that lesson or saw what happened under my predecessor, I said, \u201cHow do we not protect them the most? Sending people back who are Covid positive.\u201d It was wrong.\nMara Gay: Do you think the public is owed, in general in New York, an apology from \u2014 obviously you were not governor at the time \u2014 but from, I guess, yourself or the administration or the leaders of the state, of the city. Given how Covid unfolded in New York and the mistakes that were made early on, is there a broader apology that is owed to the residents of New York?\nI do think that the residents of New York, on balance, thought that a lot of decisions were made that were intended to protect them. That shutting things down quickly \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to armchair quarterback all this, but I have a group of independent researchers and investigators and a team who will. I will await the judgment on that because I want a very thorough analysis. The good, the bad, the ugly. I said to let us know what \u2014 and I\u2019m bringing together outside consultants, not the same consultants that were advising the previous administration, because everybody\u2019s going to want to make sure, like, they look like they did everything right.\nI want to know, \u201cCould different decisions have been made?\u201d But you look at other states, no other state was hit as hard as we were. No other state had, had trucks to take \u2014 it was hard. And I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. Everyone lived through this. No other state suffered as much as we did. And I do believe that, that my predecessor worked hard to ensure that people felt trust and confident in what was going on. That was a point of those daily press conferences. That was his effort to \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t really want to be talking about him today, but, you know, he had his approach. And if you look at what people said at the time, that was comforting to them.\nBut as we analyze it and look at the different decision points along the way, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be experts who will tell us these were done right, these were done wrong, and these are in a gray area. My responsibility as governor is to put it all together and hand it off to the next leaders and say, \u201cIf there is a pandemic \u2026.\u201d And it may not be every hundred years anymore. It may be every couple of years, where our vaccines that we\u2019re relying on now \u2014 I just had Covid the first time in two years, on Mother\u2019s Day. I got it going down to see my new grandbaby. So I was very sad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. But because I was double boosted, it was my, other people early on didn\u2019t have that. But it turns out that the next variant comes through, and everything we\u2019ve done is not protecting us anymore, and we start over from Square 1. I have to be ready for that.\nThis is what I think about: I think about the worst-case scenario. Anything that can happen. And at the same time, another hurricane is going to hit us. I mean, this is, you know, this is, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just hard-wired to think of the worst and then how I get through it. I have to have a plan. I have to be ready for it.\nSo the answer is, if the people of New York want an apology, I\u2019ll give them an apology. Certainly those nursing home families deserved one, and I gave it to them. And I\u2019ll continue working with them. But I also had to be focused on preparing for the future. That\u2019s why back in November, the day that Omicron was, was named as a variant, I ordered, I said, \u201cI want to amass every single test kit I can.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell the people of this state there are not enough test kits, there\u2019s not enough medications.\u201d I said, \u201cStart stockpiling.\u201d So I had 92 million test kits that I got out to schools, nursing homes, prisons, jails. That was my job. That was an intense time running sort of military style operation, you know, deploying. I had National Guard in hospitals. I had them all over the place.\nJyoti Thottam: What would you have done differently?\nWhat would I have done differently? I would have involved the local health departments. This was so driven from the top. Because I was out there in the battlefield. I was working hands on in the western New York upstate response. And I work with the county leaders. I convened phone calls every week with them. Actually every day for a while. And then every three days. At least it went up to every week, but initially it was every day phone calls.\nAnd they had people, public health people that were trained. Like they said, this was like getting ready for their own \u2014 their words \u2014 \u201cThis is our Super Bowl. We train our whole lives to be ready for something like that. We\u2019ve dealt with all the other viruses that have come through. We\u2019re ready for this one.\u201d And there was, decisions were made to say, \u201cNo, no, only the state can make these decisions.\u201d And you lost that local buy-in to get them engaged and helping us get, you know, the test, testing sites up and the vaccines out there and the boosters. I wouldn\u2019t do that. I come from local government. I understand that they need to be brought in at the table, and they were not during this entire process. I changed that immediately. I changed that immediately.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I want to turn to a more current crisis. Binya, do you want to jump in on housing, please?\nBinya Appelbaum: Governor, your administration backed a modest but useful change that would have made it easier to build accessory dwelling units.A term for secondary housing structures on the property of existing homes. in areas like Long Island and then backed away from it because the reaction was so negative. I\u2019m curious: Generally, how do we make progress on making it possible to build more housing in places like Long Island in the face of intense local resistance? How does your administration move forward?\nBefore the pandemic, we had an affordability crisis in housing. Now it\u2019s a crisis on steroids. It has gotten so much worse. And I\u2019m approaching the need for more affordable housing from many fronts.\nOne is, what I can do directly is to direct and put in my budget $25 billion, unprecedented amount of money, toward building new affordable housing, 100,000 units, of which about 10,000 will be supportive housing. That\u2019s going to take some time to build. I understand that.\nI saw accessory dwelling units as I walked the streets not one day, not two but three days after [inaudible]. And then I went back to East Elmhurst after the flood.Last August, Hurricane Henri broke the city\u2019s rainfall record. Just 10 days later, Hurricane Ida\u2019s downpours surpassed it in intensity, destruction and human toll. Because I thought \u2014 those people looked at me, and they said: You\u2019re never going to come back here. Here today. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m coming back tomorrow. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d Those people lived in unregulated basements, and they literally were flooded and died in their homes because no one regulated them. No one made sure that there was an exit. It was just \u2014 it was a hellhole where they lived. And they\u2019re mostly new New Yorkers. These were members of the immigrant community. They\u2019re our neighbors.\nSo I thought one of the ways we could do it is to give the city \u2014 particularly what they\u2019re asking for is the ability to have these granny units and have your, you know, your adult kids who can\u2019t afford a place to live with you. But the resistance on Long Island was fierce. And I realize that my experience in local government told me that the way to get the local buy-in is not so much with the stick but with the carrot. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s come back,\u201d because the legislators, the senators, the assembly members, you know, asked us to take another look at this, so I was responding to them. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up on this,\u201d but I\u2019m going to do is see are there incentives?\nI mean, when I was a local government official for 14 years, someone said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this incentive to do something,\u201d you\u2019ve got my attention. If you\u2019re going to beat me down and say it\u2019s now state overtaking your local zoning, you\u2019re going to get resistance. So we put the ideas forward to start the conversation as well as transit-oriented development. I talked about the places I\u2019ve been, Ronkonkoma and Wyandanch. I mean, these were transformative places, where it\u2019s just been unused brownfields next to transit stations, and all of a sudden they\u2019re beautiful homes for people with affordability.\nSo I see the future. I know how it should be done. But I also know that you can\u2019t just let people \u2014 people have been trying for years \u2014 you can\u2019t just come in and overrule local zoning without giving them an incentive. And I can find those incentives, and I\u2019m going to work with them. I\u2019m committed to doing that, but we have to do so much more in the affordable housing space because \u2014\nBinya Appelbaum: I\u2019m sorry but why not? These are communities that are essentially operating as private clubs. They\u2019re refusing to permit development of affordable units. When they are incentivized to do so, they occasionally allow the construction of isolated projects. But every assessment of Long Island\u2019s housing needs finds that there are thousands of additional units needed and that there\u2019s no way to build them under current law. Why not require these communities to do their fair share? Every other state in the Northeast has laws that require that. New York stands alone in not legislating requirements for local communities. Why are we the only state that doesn\u2019t impose those standard requirements?\nWell, you hit exactly on the answer. The word was \u201clegislate.\u201d The governor puts forth a vision, solutions, ideas in my State of the State and in my budget. But I have to get buy-in from a legislature. That is what I have to work on. And as we\u2019ve seen, many ideas that are powerful and make sense, they take time to develop. If it doesn\u2019t happen the first time, I don\u2019t throw in the towel and say, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d I say, \u201cOK, now I need to build a coalition about this.\u201d I need to get people, the residents. Residents have to be educated on how this is beneficial to them to bring more people to their communities and to just, it actually helps expand the tax base. I\u2019ll find all the rationale that I need to use to get the buy-in from the residents to put pressure on their elected officials. I\u2019m figuring out the strategy. I can\u2019t do it alone. If I could, it would be the law of the land.\nMara Gay: One brief follow-up to that. I was on the L.I.R.R. yesterday. All of those train stations that are being constructed. You could theoretically, whether you follow through or not, say no more new infrastructure for Long Island. You control the M.T.A., unless you start buying into a regional housing plan like every other state, as Binya is talking about, so why not use that?\nThat is definitely an option. You know, we put forth our plan that we\u2019d hope would be accepted. We understood, having seen the resistance, that, OK, there\u2019s got to be another approach. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, building in this off-season, when the sessions, when they\u2019re out of session. I said this is a top priority of mine. But, you know, it\u2019s, it cannot be segregation. You know, I grew up in a household where my parents were fighting segregation in neighborhoods back when I was a kid. I mean, it was not a popular thing to do in a white neighborhood.\nBut I remember as a child, my parents, there was a program called Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Started back then. And so, this is part of who I am. So I will try to find the answers and work with people and take the ideas from, from our journalists and experts and people in academia to find out how to get this done.\nThere are places on Long Island that are beautiful examples and transit hubs. You know, like I mentioned, Wyandanch and Ronkonkoma. They are great models that I\u2019m going to go out there and educate and say, \u201cLook at this. This is what you are afraid of? Do you realize how amazing this is? There\u2019s little coffee shops and little stores, and people are living above.\u201d\nI\u2019ve walked through these buildings, and no one should be afraid of them. It\u2019s where people deserve to live. Young people, senior citizens, people who are essential workers who don\u2019t have high incomes. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But I\u2019m willing to. I mean, a lot of important ideas take some time. But I\u2019m willing to. I already jumped in the water on this one, and I\u2019m going to keep swimming.\nEleanor Randolph: So, Governor, could we talk a little bit about the potential conflict of interest that people in Albany talk about all the time? First with the Buffalo Billion. And your husband is a lobbyist with Delaware North, and one of your, one of the people on your staff who\u2019s supposed to be looking at your recusal document, her husband works for Bolton-St. Johns,After this interview was published, Thomas P. Connolly Jr. of Bolton-St. Johns told The Times that the company did not lobby lawmakers in Albany to help build the Buffalo stadium. which is the lobbying group that dealt with the Buffalo stadium. So how do you deal with the potential for a conflict of interest there? Will you or your family gain anything from the Buffalo stadium, the Buffalo Billion?\nAbsolutely not. First of all, my husband is not a lobbyist.\nEleanor Randolph: No, I know he isn\u2019t. But he \u2014\nBut the company, but, but Delaware North, simply provides the concessions. They have nothing to do with the stadium. If the Buffalo Bills went to Los Angeles, like they\u2019re looking to do, which \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: But they hired the lobbyists to do this, well in St. John.\nWell, my \u2014 all the recusals are handled by Liz Fine, our counsel\u2019s office. Her husband works at the Brennan justice center. So, Liz Fine. I have attorneys who are responsible. I have signed recusal forms back early in my tenure. My husband\u2019s salary has been adjusted. So there\u2019s no, no revenues, no revenues that he takes part of it, in terms of any benefit. This is a very small part of Delaware North\u2019s overall portfolio. From what I read in the paper, they may have operations around the globe. So this is a small part. They just do the concessions. They don\u2019t own the team. They\u2019re just one of the concessionaires.\nBut I understand when people raise this, I mean, integrity is very important to me. I spent my entire life in public service. My husband was a federal prosecutor for 30 years. He was Barack Obama\u2019s United States attorney. We are well accustomed to the separation that\u2019s required between our careers. We\u2019ve always lived that way. And so he has been, you know, since Donald Trump took office and he left the U.S. attorney, you know, he has been in the private sector. But we are very, very, very careful about not having any involvement or engagement or financial gain that comes from anything involved here. I appreciate the question, but integrity is very important to both of us.\nEleanor Randolph: Let\u2019s go back and talk. Sorry \u2014\nKathleen Kingsbury: Could you speak a little bit more broadly about what you see as the return on investment for this new stadium?Ms. Hochul helped negotiate a deal with the Buffalo Bills to build a $1.4 billion stadium for the team. Taxpayers will fund much of it.\nSure. It\u2019ll pay for itself in a matter of years, for sure. You know, I understand people\u2019s questions about it. It is a regional priority. And just to draw an analogy, I was on Broadway a couple days ago, and I thought, the Buffalo Bills, part of western New York the way Broadway is to New York City. Its unique asset is something that gives you a sense of pride and galvanizes a community that doesn\u2019t have a whole lot sometimes, you know? For a long time, now we have so much more in Buffalo.\nFor a long time, that was a cohesive part of the community, and they were actually very much able to leave the state. They\u2019re being wooed by larger markets, a very small market. So the timing was not ideal. Barely 30 years, and the stadium started crumbling at the upper decks. They were ready to look at other places if there was not a plan. They asked for 1.4 billion, the whole cost. I said no. Our share ended up being 43 percent of it.\nPeople will criticize. It\u2019s a regional priority, a regional asset, very important to majority leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes. Very important to the head of transportation, Senator Tim Kennedy. So the legislators locally, this is very, very important to them as well. It\u2019ll create 10,000 jobs. It\u2019ll pay for itself. The economic benefit from the study we had AECOM do independently just to find out if this made sense. $350 million. That might be on the high end, but the salaries of the players, if you calculated what paid more, the income tax on the salaries of the players will more than pay for the state investment.\nSo it\u2019s a lot to explain to people. It comes down to a sound bite, you know, giveaways to billionaire donors. They\u2019re not my donors. I never took a dime from them. The state owns the stadium. This is not for them. It\u2019s for the, for the asset, to have that in our community. But I\u2019m going to continue finding ways to lift up all communities and investing in signature projects for them, to have that same sense of pride that I know, as someone from Buffalo, that people have with their other assets. So I\u2019m going to make those investments all over. I understand people\u2019s questions. I really do.\nMara Gay: Great. We\u2019re just going to do a little bit of a lightning round here for fun. How much has the annual ridership of the subway declined since 2019, about? An estimate is fine.\nWell, it declined down to about, you know, a small percentage, but right now, we\u2019re at about 60 or 70 percent.\nI find the ridership is actually higher. This is funny. It\u2019s declined during normal commuting hours, but it\u2019s up almost back to normal on weekends and evenings. So that says to me, people are, you know, afraid to go to work on the subway, but they\u2019re not afraid to go take the subway. So we\u2019re back up to about 60, 70 percent now.\nMara Gay: Which is about how many million riders?\nThree million, three and a half.\nMara Gay: Three and a half, yeah. Under what circumstances are abortions allowed in New York after 24 weeks of pregnancy?\nHealth of the mother.\nMara Gay: And also viability of the fetus.\nOh, yes, yeah.\nMara Gay: What is the average cost of SUNY tuition, including room and board, for one year?\nWith or without my tuition assistance plan?\nMara Gay: Full. Full cost.\nI don\u2019t know that exactly.\nMara Gay: An estimate is fine.\nTen?\nMara Gay: 23,000.\nOh, OK. You said room and board?\nMara Gay: Including room and board.\nI\u2019m sorry, I fixed on tuition. Ten\u2019s the tuition here. But I am very happy that we now have it available for part-time students. Nobody\u2019s done that before. That was huge. And I hear that everywhere I go. People are so excited they don\u2019t have to try to figure out how to work full time, take a semester off, work full time. Now it\u2019s part time, so I\u2019m really excited about that \u2014\nMara Gay: Sorry, can I speak? It\u2019s the lightning round \u2014\nGo ahead, go ahead.\nMara Gay: Thank you. Where\u2019d you go on your last vacation?\nPortugal. Um, five, four years ago. Three years ago. Maybe three years ago.\nMara Gay: What is the median sale price of a home in Rochester? A guess is fine.\nWhat part of Rochester? The city? Downtown?\nMara Gay: Well, it\u2019s the median so \u2014\nI know the region. Parts of the region is very affluent.\nMara Gay: Rochester proper.\nI\u2019d say downtown Rochester, median houses are about 78.\nMara Gay: $180,000. What about \u2014\nI\u2019m thinking downtown Rochester. Check on that for me. Because it\u2019s like downtown Buffalo.\nMara Gay: OK. I will. What about White Plains?\nEight?\nMara Gay: $730,000. And Staten Island?\nThat always shocks me. The houses are so small. I\u2019d say five or six. Yeah, five or six.\nMara Gay: $640,000. What was your favorite class \u2014\nI know what an apartment costs in Brooklyn, too. About four.\nMara Gay: What was your favorite class in high school?\nSocial studies.\nMara Gay: Great. Thank you for that. So I just wanted to turn to the budget for a moment, Governor. Blair Horner of NYPIRG, the good-government group, said that the budget you negotiated was one of the most secretive he\u2019d ever seen. I mean, first of all, just what is your response to that? I mean, criticism of Governor Cuomo was very similar. But what will you do differently to give us a more transparent budget process? How do you justify that?\nI also listen to other voices, someone like Dick Gottfried, who told me it\u2019s the best budget he\u2019s seen in 50 years. We put forth our plan in January. I\u2019m not sure what was secretive about it. I laid it all out. I announced my State of the State. I put forth the budget. It was seen by the world in, in mid-January. And basically most of that budget stayed intact, except we increased it. And the leaders were so stunned because they are so used to the game playing, where they take away money for health care and education and child care and pre-K and the environment.\nAnd then you had to beg to have it out, you had to deal to get it put back in. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not playing games.\u201d I\u2019m more collaborative. I said I would be, and I am. So everybody still didn\u2019t quite trust it when I put forth, you know, transformational amounts of money in, in health care and education and child care infrastructure. We can talk about it. I\u2019m heading over to the East Side Access to make the announcement shortly.\nWe did it differently, you know. We laid it all out there. And I didn\u2019t make them have to fight, borrow and steal and negotiate. We increased our, our environmental bond act from $3 billion to $4.2 billion. I asked for that increase from what I had inherited. We had our conversation. What I didn\u2019t give people who were the inside watchers was blow after blow of criticism of each other. I think people used to say, oh, you know, now it was this person, this and this. I didn\u2019t do that intentionally because that doesn\u2019t restore people\u2019s faith in government. When you\u2019re out there taking shots at each other and criticizing and just trying to score political points, it, it takes away the face. I didn\u2019t do that. So I put together a budget that is extraordinary.\nMara Gay: Well, I think the question isn\u2019t really about the end result of the budget. The question is about the process and the transparency. So, for example, there was no gaggle of news reporters able to ask questions about the budget. And as you know, some of the most controversial pieces of the budget come together at the last minute. So why not commit to just kind of reintroducing some of the kinds of transparency measures around that, you know, budget season that would make the budget process more transparent in New York rather than a fly by night at the end of the budget session, as it has always been.\nThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s always been this big ugly where people just put everything at the end. I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. At the end of session, where human nature is, you put out ideas. I started meeting with the leadership early in March, you know, just saying, \u201cHey, how are we going to get there?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to just make it a political battle in the press. I just, I chose not to, because I wanted to be able to have conversations with the two of them and then make some decisions and put it out there afterward. We can always assess the approach we took. This is my first budget and doing it to scale.\nI do think that there was a lot of mistrust because they had so, been so conditioned to a certain process, and I had to show them that I really was treating them like partners. We had $2 billion extra in Covid money that I absolutely could have put toward anything I wanted to. And I said, \u201cNo, you tell me what you want.\u201d So we put more money toward the ERAP rent relief program after getting our $2 billion out. We\u2019ve added another $800 million. We put in more money for utility, for utilities. I wanted to base it on their priorities so they would have buy-in. I said, \u201cThis is a shared document. This is not just the governor\u2019s budget and I\u2019m going to beat you into submission.\u201d We did it differently. And yes, we can talk next year about how to, you know, open it up more.\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of days where we \u2014 I was sick. I don\u2019t know how many days I was without doing a gag line. I know that was frustrating. Also, my entire team had Covid. Everybody on my budget negotiation team were all working remotely. It was tough. I mean, they were dropping like flies. So it was a challenge. I hope to not have that next year. To answer your question, yeah, I understand the question. I look at the results. The results are exceptional. This is an exceptional budget.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I\u2019m concerned we haven\u2019t hit upon two very critical issues. The first of which is public safety right now in the state, at least the perception that crime has risen here in the city and elsewhere. Can you talk a little bit about what you can do right now in order to help that? And then I want to also talk about the M.T.A. as well.\nSure. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of talk about bail reform. I have stood behind reform from Day 1. I said we had an injustice, a system of injustice where two people accused of the same offense, one Black, usually one white. And the white kid, maybe from more affluent means. Parents have money; they post bail. They\u2019re back out at school. They\u2019re back at their jobs. They show up at trial. They have a good lawyer, and they\u2019re off.\nYoung Black gentleman, kid, teenager, who doesn\u2019t have that support? They\u2019re going to Rikers. They\u2019re going to Rikers. I will say that was wrong for the rest of my life. So I never said anything needed to be changed based on changing that fundamental premise, but what happened is that we had to look at this. A lot of offenses were taken out of consideration for bail, and some of them were gun offenses. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who thinks it\u2019s OK that someone could walk on a schoolyard and have a gun. Which was one of those offenses that if there was not, you know, prior history, that person goes before a judge. They\u2019re back out on the street.\nI think that I need to insert some comments. There are areas where I don\u2019t even know that the legislators knew exactly where it had been. Repeat offenders, for example. The little grocery stores. I walked to some, and it was a little bodega in the Bronx. And he said, I just leave my grocery store \u2014 I leave the cash drawer open every day because they\u2019re going to come in and take the money. Day after day and they\u2019re back to us. So we had to do something.\nHate crimes. Hate crimes have been excluded. We have such a rise in Asian hate crimes and antisemitism. And there\u2019s a fear out there. I go to these \u2014 all the time, they\u2019re just generally, one\u2019s too afraid to walk the streets because someone\u2019s going to come and harm them, assault them physically, verbally. So we made a few changes. We dealt with repeat offenders, but that was not the whole problem.\nThe problem is the guns on the streets. And let\u2019s just acknowledge that, that that access to guns, that pipelines of gunsMany guns are trafficked from Southern states, where gun laws are less restrictive, to Northeastern states, where gun laws are more restrictive, along I-95, which law enforcement officials have nicknamed the Iron Pipeline. that is still coming here is one that I started addressing way before we had the Buffalo massacre or before Texas. I assembled a team to work on this last January. And we\u2019re making progress. We have over 4,000 guns statewide that have been confiscated, including 250 ghost guns, which were legal up until I signed a bill outlawing them. So we have found more areas where there\u2019s gaps in our laws. They need to be tighter. Twenty-one-year-olds should not be buying an AR \u2014 or, I\u2019m sorry, an 18-year-old should not be able to buy an AR-15, and they won\u2019t be at the end of this week. I\u2019m telling you right now: I\u2019m going to get that through. I\u2019m going to get that through.\nNick Fox: How do you deal with the M.T.A. beyond just crime reduction? As you mentioned, it\u2019s down about 40 percent. Ridership revenue is down. It\u2019s being kept afloat by federal money now. What happens when the federal money is gone and you need to do the sort of repairs that have been delayed for years and years? And increase ridership?\nThat\u2019s a challenge we have. That is a challenge. It was a lot easier before the pandemic, when ridership was up. We had a plan for congestion pricing to help bring in a steady stream of income to support it. We\u2019re still waiting for the federal government, you know, they keep throwing more barriers in front of us right now. And I\u2019m going to be announcing something on how we\u2019re trying to get around that shortly.\nBut, yes, we have to have a steady revenue source. I\u2019m going to have to have the state be helping the M.T.A. I mean, this is not something that we can let fail. I have to stick with the very ambitious capital plan, not taking our foot off the pedal there, because for people to come back, I have to offer them a world-class experience. New Yorkers deserve a world-class transportation experience. They don\u2019t get that right now.\nEven something like Penn Station. I mean, that\u2019s a hellhole. It should not exist in a city like this. So I\u2019m taking it on. We\u2019ll find the resources. We\u2019ll get it done. But I\u2019m not going to use this as an excuse right now to say, \u201cWell, times are tough. The ridership\u2019s down. Let\u2019s just put the M.T.A. investments over here. We\u2019ll do it the next decade.\u201d We\u2019ve done that for too long. So I\u2019m leaning into infrastructure, including the M.T.A. investments. And we have to inspire people to come back. I take the subway a lot, and I talk to people. I thank them for being out there, and you know, there\u2019s a lot of people who just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the experience they deserve, and they\u2019re absolutely right.\nNick Fox: How will you increase safety in the subway system?\nLooking back, it was January, first week of Eric Adams\u2019s term. We went down to the subways together. We talked about restoring safety, dealing with the humanitarian crisis of people feeling like that\u2019s where they have to live, because society has not offered them a better home. The homelessness problem. So we talked about the state working with the city.\nNow that was a radical announcement. Still is whenever I do this. I said, \u201cCity\u2019s responsible for public safety on the subways, but I oversee the subway. So why aren\u2019t we working together?\u201d Why aren\u2019t I bringing in support teams to help people who are homeless and to give them, you know, an alternative and not just warehousing them in, in \u2014 the shelters are just not acceptable. We need to fix the shelters but also mental health.\nThere\u2019s a whole mental health side of this on the homeless side, but also the overall safety. I\u2019ve said, if you need more people from the M.T.A., police will be helping you. I don\u2019t want to make a militarized zone. I want people to feel comfortable there. But if we need more surveillance cameras that work, we have a lot more to do. He\u2019s proposed, you know, metal detectors. I will entertain any idea, but it has to be one that\u2019s actually going to work. We have to test that as well.\nNick Fox: What about police on trains?\nPolice on trains? I think that that gives people comfort. They see, you know, undercover \u2014 if there\u2019s undercover people, just people embedded in, they can deal with other problems, too. Other things have happened, you know. So I\u2019m just trying to find \u2014\nNick Fox: Is that happening?\nN.Y.P.D. \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing undercover.\nNick Fox: Is the state providing more officers?\nNo, we\u2019re \u2014 we have offered to the city that we\u2019ll help you. Their police force is much larger than our M.T.A. force.\nNick Fox: I understand.\nBut I\u2019ve offered from \u2014 I said, you tell me you need help, we\u2019ll be down there with you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Lauren, do you want to ask about reproductive rights?\nLauren Kelley: Yes. Hi, Governor.\nHi, Lauren.\nLauren Kelley: Hi. So I know you\u2019ve already said that you\u2019ll release $35 million in emergency funds, if and when Roe v. Wade is overturned. I was wondering if you could speak to us a little bit about the other priorities that you see for shoring up New York, whether it\u2019s through legislation or whatnot, to prepare for the massive influx of patients that we\u2019re likely to see, likely to see not just short term but really sort of for the long haul.\nI\u2019m already releasing that $35 million because we are already experiencing increase in people coming from other states. For example, western New York. Their Planned Parenthood is overwhelmed right now. They have people coming in from Ohio [inaudible] three hours from Buffalo is, is Cleveland. So we already have that situation. So I wanted to not wait but also bolster up their ability to expand their space, hire people, not wait till the last minute. So we\u2019ve already undertaken.\nThe other thing we have to do is protect the providers in New York who do serve someone from out of state. I don\u2019t want these crazy laws from Texas where some vigilante nut case can come to New York and, you know, file lawsuits against our providers. I\u2019m taking action now in our legislation to protect our providers so they don\u2019t have that chilling effect on their ability to provide these services, because we are going to be a beacon for the rest of the nation. I stood up there and said that we are a safe harbor.\nAnd it\u2019s part of our legacy is, you know, protecting these rights, three years before Roe v. Wade or even now. So it\u2019s resources. It\u2019s legally protecting. It\u2019s also enshrining these rights in the New York State Constitution. And we talked about this for years, and everybody said: Well, why do you even have to have the Reproductive Health Act enacted into law in New York? I mean, no one will ever come and take away these rights. I\u2019m sorry. They are, the Supreme Court has changed it. But also, we won\u2019t go into politics, but I guess this is a political endorsement. But, you know, we have someone running for governor who\u2019s saying that he would make sure that his health commissioner is pro-life. It would open his door to all the pro-life advocates. That\u2019s why I have to be successful. I have to be the firewall against that.\nWe also have to make sure that, that people feel safe, that we protect them. And security grants. We have to have more security for the facilities. I mean, I come from the town where Dr. Barnett SlepianIn 1998, Dr. Slepian, one of three doctors who provided abortions in the Buffalo area, was killed by a sniper\u2019s bullet in his home. The Times reported that \u201che had endured years of picketing and harassment, apparently moving his family into a new home in a quiet, affluent subdivision two years ago in hope of avoiding protesters.\u201d was gunned down in his home. And the people who live down the hall from me in my condo is a doctor and a nurse who provided abortions to people before it was legal. And we don\u2019t want to go back to that era where people are now fearful for their lives. Not just in New York. I\u2019m worried about the rest of the country. Gosh, I do. I could protect New Yorkers, but it pains me as a woman and as a woman governor to know that people in other states will not have the same rights as women in my state.\nLauren Kelley: Just a really quick follow-up to that. The effort to enter abortion rights in the New York State Constitution \u2014 what\u2019s the latest on that? How are things looking on that front?\nWell, there\u2019s been an ongoing debate between different legislators about how much should go into that amendment, what other rights should be protected. You know, do we include disability rights and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community? There are some who wanted it years ago to just model after the Equal Rights Amendment and just talk about gender. There are others who want to make it more expansive. So that\u2019s the conversation that\u2019s going now.\nThe governor doesn\u2019t actually vote on a constitutional amendment. They pass it. It goes to the voters. I mean, they pass it two consecutive sessions, and then it goes to the voters. But I\u2019ve weighed in strong, saying, \u201cGet something done. Stop talking about this.\u201d You know, we never dreamed we\u2019d get this close to the edge of losing these rights. And now we are.\nJyoti Thottam: Yeah. So you\u2019ve mentioned Buffalo a few times, understandably, in this conversation. That shooting there definitely showed the whole world that domestic extremism is a presence here in New York State. What are you doing to address that?\nTwo approaches. One is addressing how the radicalization occurred of an 18-year-old sitting in Conklin, N.Y., which is about as rural as it gets. And I have asked the attorney general, and we\u2019re looking at legislation that\u2019ll actually stand up a task force within the attorney general\u2019s office, to be monitoring social media. Trying to identify the threats and actually making threats illegal. That\u2019s another piece of legislation that I started looking at late last night. To do we can to put the companies on notice. I can\u2019t legally stop you because of Section 230 in the federal law, but I\u2019m going to find a way to make you be more responsible than you have been. I can\u2019t legally make you respond. I\u2019m going to make you be more responsible, and we\u2019re going to find a way to do that. So there\u2019s a part of it.\nWhen there\u2019s that hate speech, these white supremacist manifestoes. The replacement theory that\u2019s shared and shared, from what happened in New Zealand to Christchurch all the way to what happens in Buffalo. There\u2019s that element because you can have that hate in your heart and sit in your basement and not act on it. OK. As I said in church on Sunday, I said, \u201cGod will deal with you.\u201d But you can\u2019t hurt somebody. I said, \u201cOnce you also take that and have access to an AR-15 legally as an 18-year-old in the State of New York\u201d \u2014 not high-capacity magazine, which you can drive over 10 minutes, and he lives 10 minutes from the Pennsylvania border, and add on the high-capacity magazine intended for the battlefields of Afghanistan, where I once visited \u2014 \u201cnow we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d That has to stop. That\u2019s the part we have control over.\nMy gun interdiction task force state police, he said: I don\u2019t need you looking at people, you know, I\u2019d rather you stop going after the speeders so much. Go after the guys loading up their trucks in Pennsylvania with guns and bringing them to the Bronx or to Brooklyn. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\nSo two approaches: how we deal with the radicalization side of it and the responsibility of social media platforms and how law enforcement needs to be identifying the threats in advance, but also the access to guns.\nJyoti Thottam: So the law enforcement piece \u2014 do you think that law enforcement in New York state is treating domestic extremism appropriately, as a priority? What are they doing to coordinate?\nThey are now. They are now.\nMara Gay: What is the measure of that?\nUnder the past administration, we had one person in the state police department monitoring social media. I\u2019m building up a team. I\u2019m hiring the best. I\u2019m hiring the best. We\u2019re standing up a task force on that. We are doing a lot. I\u2019m taking this very seriously.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time. It occurs to me through this conversation that your to-do list is quite long. There are many times that you said, \u201cI want to do this.\u201d How concerned are you that there\u2019s going to be an economic recession, and what have you done to prepare the state for that?\nI\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s an excellent question, because as we are looking at this year, where I had my first budget, I wanted to invest money in areas that had not been invested in properly. Foundation aid, education, health care, child care, $7 billion for health careMs. Hochul\u2019s first budget includes $7 billion in child care funding for New York families. to help struggling families. I wanted to get all that done. But there was also pressure to take every dollar of money we had and spend it this year and also have out-year expenses.\nI couldn\u2019t do that because this year, I said \u2014 back at the end of the year, I said, I don\u2019t know how long the stock markets will be strong. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to have high-net-worth people contributing to our tax base. I also don\u2019t \u2014 cannot count on Washington to give us any more money. This was before they said no to the, the CARES Act.\nSo all three of those turned out to be right \u2014 what I said I could not count on and build a budget around in January. When everybody wanted me to spend more, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to build up our reserves.\u201d When I took over this position, we had 4 percent of reserves in the state budget. I had done 14 municipal budgets. We always made sure we had 15 percent. That\u2019s a commonly accepted practice: 15 percent reserves for a rainy day or a blizzard day, which is where I come from.\nI have invested $5 billion extra, 2022. I\u2019ll be putting more into 2023. I\u2019m going to build it up to 15 percent. So at least we can be self-reliant and I don\u2019t have to wait on if we have another pandemic and another hurricane at the same time and the federal government says we\u2019re done with that, especially, see, if the leadership changes in the House and the Senate. That\u2019s the world I lived in when I was in Congress a decade ago.\nThat\u2019s when Superstorm Sandy hit, and the Republicans in the House and Senate would not send money to New York until we\u2019ve had cutbacks everywhere else, even though we didn\u2019t do that during Katrina. I\u2019ve lived long enough to see all the bad scenarios. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m always prepared.\nSo we\u2019ll have the ability to take care of ourselves. I also made sure that a lot of our Covid spending was this year only, that we didn\u2019t get ourselves trapped into out year. So I don\u2019t have out-year gaps from now to 2027. That was very important to me, to have a very progressive budget, one that was fiscally responsible, because I cannot turn back to New York and say, \u201cWell, I have to go raise your taxes now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWe can get this right if we\u2019re thoughtful about it and don\u2019t succumb to a lot of pressure to do things. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m immune to. I just have this clarity of purpose as a leader in this state to know what has to be done, find a path to get it done, not be dissuaded by all the other voices that are out there. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve had to perfect in the last nine months as governor.\nKathleen Kingsbury: All right, I think we\u2019re just out of time. Thank you so much for being here.

He was a Nassau County executive and a mayor of his hometown, Glen Cove, on Long Island Sound.\nThis interview with Mr. Suozzi was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times on May 23.\nRead the board\u2019s endorsement for the Democratic gubernatorial primary here.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So we\u2019re just going to launch into questions, if that works for you.\nI would like to say a couple of things first, if I can.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You have one minute.\nWow. So I\u2019m a lifelong Democrat. I was the environmentalist of the year for the New York League of Conservation Voters. I was the person of the year for the New York Immigration Coalition. I have a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood. I have a 100 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign. I have an F rating from the N.R.A. I\u2019m the chair of the labor caucus in Congress,The House\u2019s Labor Caucus was formed in 2020 to help expand union power for American workers. It has 120 members and six co-chairs, including Mr. Suozzi. and I\u2019ve been getting elected over \u2014 in, in difficult areas for Democrats over many, many years.\nAnd I was very influenced by The New York Times in a couple different things: Your editorial board editorial on Nov. 4 had a very big impact on me and persuaded me to do one thing, that persuaded me to run for governor, because of the fact that the Democrats need to recognize the politics of what we\u2019re doing.\nOK, this is the November \u2014 for the people on the screen \u2014 this is the Nov. 4, 2021, editorial by The New York Times.Last fall, Virginia Republicans swept statewide offices, shifting the state to the right and revealing the broader Democratic Party\u2019s weaknesses ahead of the midterms. The board wrote that Democrats badly needed to energize voters with moderate policies as they have before.\nKathleen Kingsbury: It\u2019s the editorial in wake of the Virginia election.\n\u201cDemocrats Deny Political Reality at Their Own Peril.\u201d And what\u2019s needed is an honest conversation with the Democratic Party. The results of Virginia, the results in New Jersey, Bill Clinton\u2019s mantra.\nWe better stop knocking bipartisan deals. We have to look at many blue enclaves like Buffalo, where I got involved in.\nI actually went up to Buffalo based upon something else in The New York Times, which was written by Ezra Klein about David Shor\u2019s polling. And it talked about how defunding the police and other Democratic messages are killing the Democratic Party. And I\u2019m the only Democrat in New York State who went up to campaign for Byron Brown against India Walton after she had won the Democratic primary, even though Kathy Hochul\u2019s from Buffalo, did not get involved in that race. Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a whole bunch of others campaigned for India Walton, even though she was declared socialist in that campaign.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Well, you\u2019re getting into one of my first questions. In light of what we see as a national crisis around democracy, how will you rebuild trust? How will you rebuild voter trust in government and the democratic process in New York State after what has been a long list of failures on Covid but also corruption scandals?\nYeah, the most important thing we need to do is listen to what the people want and give them \u2014 the purpose of democracy is supposed to be that the elected officials represent the people and you need to do what the people want. That doesn\u2019t happen in New York State.\nIt hasn\u2019t happened for 30 years because it\u2019s an insider\u2019s game and everybody keeps on getting re-elected, no matter what they do. And the only way people lose their jobs is by scandal, whether it\u2019s Cuomo or Spitzer or Paterson or it\u2019s Alan Hevesi or it\u2019s Eric Schneiderman or it\u2019s Dean Skelos or it\u2019s Joe Bruno or Sheldon Silver or Brian BenjaminIn April, Brian Benjamin, Ms. Hochul\u2019s running mate and lieutenant governor, resigned after being arrested and charged with bribery and fraud. Ms. Hochul appointed him despite potential concerns about his use of campaign funds and suspicious donations while he was a state senator that were raised in his background check. or it\u2019s dozens of other lesser figures.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Quite a list.\nAnd we were declared the most corrupt state in the United States of America by The Washington Post last August.\nAnd Kathy Hochul has continued that trend, doing the stuff that your paper talks against all the time. She raised $20 million in a shorter period of time \u2014 more money than Cuomo ever did or Spitzer ever did or Pataki ever did. And she didn\u2019t get it because she\u2019s inspired people.\nPeople are not inspired by the Buffalo Bills deal. They\u2019re not inspired by Brian Benjamin. They\u2019re not inspired by the most secretive budget process in New York State in 30 years, according to Blair Horner, who\u2019s been up there for 30 years. Eleanor knows Blair Horner well, I\u2019m sure. Every other outside observer said this was the most secretive budget process in 30 years.\nThey\u2019re not inspired by the fact that she\u2019s not even making crime a priority. Forget about what I think we should do or what she thinks we should do or anybody thinks we should do. Let\u2019s at least make it a priority and talk about it. But it\u2019s not even a priority for her.\nShe didn\u2019t even talk about it even after the cops were killed in New York City and she laid out a plan \u2014 and it\u2019s not even a plan; it\u2019s a half-baked press release she did 10 days before the budget was due \u2014 and she leaked it,In a March statement to City & State New York, a spokesperson for Ms. Hochul denied releasing the public safety plan to The New York Post. and she told everybody: I\u2019m not going to talk about it. I\u2019m not going to negotiate in public.\nIt\u2019s been a secretive insider game the way it\u2019s always been in Albany. And we need competition, and we need The New York Times to help make this race more competitive by endorsing Tom Suozzi.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Mara, do you want to jump in?\nMara Gay: We had this horrific killing yesterday in which a 48-year-old man was shot to death on a Q train. What would you do as governor right now to help make the subways safer? Obviously, that\u2019s partially a city responsibility, for the most part \u2014\nIt\u2019s my No. 1 priority.\nMara Gay: What would you do?\nI have a 15-point crime intervention and prevention plan that I\u2019ve talked about every single day. It\u2019s not like Fox News crime prevention, OK?\nIt\u2019s giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness. And couple that with technology using a CompStat for justice proposed by a Yale professor, Phillip Atiba Goff, that suggests that we should use statistics to monitor the behavior of police officers the way we monitor the behavior of criminals. Use that \u2014 I\u2019m proposing, you can say this \u2014 use it for judges as well to monitor their behavior.\nMartin Luther King used to say, you can\u2019t legislate morality, but you can regulate behavior.\nUse statistics: It\u2019s accepted by the police through CompStat. Use statistics. How often is this police officer using use of force? Is he using it in particular neighborhoods? How often is this judge remanding somebody? What kind of bail are they giving? Use statistics to analyze the behavior and look for those outliers that are ruining the reputation of law enforcement and hold them accountable for their bad behavior.\nBut my 15-point plan is not just about intervention \u2014 all the stuff that the mayor is talking about that I support 100 percent. I endorsed the mayor very early. I campaigned for the mayor. I raised money for the mayor. The mayor asked me to be his deputy mayor. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be your deputy mayor. I\u2019m running for governor. I can help you more as governor than I can as deputy mayor. And help New York City more.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a 15-point plan that includes intervention \u2014 stuff right now, stuff that I did as Nassau County executive, when I ran the 12th-largest police department of America, bigger than Detroit or Boston. I had the lowest crime rate in the United States of America when I left \u2014 to prevention, long-term prevention, the thing that I\u2019m most passionate about, that I \u2014 one of the reasons I really want to be the governor of New York State is to take all of our health and human services and bring them into our schools. Because the problems that exist in our schools \u2014 we already spend more per student than any state in the United States of America. Our results are below average. We need to take social services, health, mental health, veterans, seniors, youth, physically challenged, drug and alcohol, every federally funded, state funded, locally funded and not for profit and bring them into our schools.\nSo when you look at test scores for third grade, kids in the good school district and kids in the average school districts are pretty similar in third grade. But by eighth grade, kids in a good school district are skyrocketing. The kids in average school districts have fallen off the face of the earth. All the problems of life are emerging at that time.\nThe teachers can\u2019t deal with the volume of problems. It\u2019s impossible in average school districts. Good school districts, you know, they got private health insurance. They got their families. They got school psychologists, school guidance counselor, school social worker. They can help them deal with their volume of problems. But if you\u2019re in the Roosevelt school district or some of the New York City school districts or the Buffalo school district, 70 percent of the kids bring a problem with them. You can never get the resources to fight \u2014 do more programs. We have to change the mind-set and take our existing programs and bring them into our schools so that when a kid has a problem, the teacher says, \u201cBoy, this kid is falling asleep and getting in fights. They\u2019re being disrespectful. Their life is falling apart. Let\u2019s bring in a social worker to help navigate the bureaucracy with the existing programs that exist all over the place.\u201d\nBut right now, they\u2019re designed for somebody to show up at the window when they\u2019re an adult and they\u2019re in crisis and they got to get help now or that everything\u2019s over.\nBishop Desmond Tutu used to say \u2014 Eric Adams uses this line a lot \u2014 we spend a lifetime pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and stop them from falling in the river in the first place. We have to change the whole mentality of health and human services towards prevention.\nNick Fox: Do you think there\u2019s evidence that existing programs are underused?\nNo, I think that they\u2019re inefficient, and I think that they\u2019re spread out all over the place and they\u2019re designed for reaction, as opposed to prevention. And we have to change that mind-set. It\u2019s the same thing with health care, quite frankly. But this is for mental health and drugs and alcohol. Seventy-five percent of people in jail have a drug or alcohol \u2014 when they\u2019re at schools \u2026\nNick Fox: You\u2019re saying \u2014\nThe problem \u2014\nNick Fox: You\u2019re saying we don\u2019t need more resources in the school; we just need to reallocate resources, and I\u2019m saying, aren\u2019t those resources \u2014\nI didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t need more resources. I\u2019m all for increasing state aid and moving away from property taxes towards state aid \u2019cause property taxes are a regressive tax.\nBut the answer is not going to be just more spending, because we already have the highest taxes in America, highest state and local taxes in America, and we already spend more per student than any state in the United States of America.\nThere has to be a complete rethinking of taking our existing resources on the outside, floating out here in the ether very ineffectively and very inefficiently \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years \u2014 and bring them into the schools and stop the silo between education, health and human services and law enforcement and bring them together. \u2019Cause 75 percent of people who are in jail have a drug, alcohol or mental health problem. Fifty percent of people at Rikers IslandThe Times was unable to confirm this figure for incarcerated people at the Rikers Island jail complex. have a learning disability.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We have a whole list of questions for you. Lauren, do you want to jump in?\nLauren Kelley: Sure. Hi. Thanks for being here. So I wanted to ask about reproductive rights. You know, obviously, we are very likely headed into a post-Roe America. So I\u2019m curious what your plan is to protect New York in this coming future without Roe v. Wade, very likely. And specifically, if you have thought about a plan for the massive influx of patients that we\u2019re \u2014 that abortion clinics here in New York are very likely to see once abortion is banned in a number of red states.\nI would support what the governor is proposing right now, by putting more money into the programs and making that available to women who are trying to come to New York State. As I mentioned earlier I have a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood.\nI think that abortion must remain safe, legal and accessible. And I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure that New York State is a standard-bearer, as far as abortion rights and abortion access. I also think that New York State should be a standard-bearer, as far as trying to prevent unintended pregnancies by increasing education and contraception.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Binya?\nBinya Appelbaum: The New York area is \u2014 you\u2019re not going to be surprised by the topic of this question \u2014 one of the hardest places to find affordable housing in the United States. One big reason for that is that New York\u2019s suburbs have been extremely resistant to new development. What, if anything, do you think should change in order to make it possible to build more housing in counties like Nassau and Suffolk?\nSo, as The New York Times said in its 2016 endorsement of my congressional campaign in the general election, \u201cHe\u2019s been a national leader in the battle to limit urban sprawl and revitalize aging suburbs.\u201d\nAnd part of that was to create a concept called cool downtowns that I started talking about 20 years ago, which is about going up in our downtowns around our train stations, building apartments, building office, building restaurants, building shops, making the downtowns of places like Long Island much more attractive for young people and increasing transit-oriented development. We\u2019ve had some successes.\nIf you look at the Mineola train station on Long Island, if you look at Patchogue, if you look at my hometown in Glen Cove, if you look in Rockville Centre, if you look at Long Beach, if you look at Farmingdale, those things are starting to happen. It\u2019s a big fight.\nIt was a very difficult fight to start 20 years ago, when the Republicans campaigned against me saying, \u201cTom Suozzi wants to make Nassau County the sixth borough.\u201d And they attacked what I \u2014 the complete urbanization I was bringing to Nassau County.\nAnd I laid out a plan that said that: Listen, 95 percent, maybe even 99 percent of our landmass should stay the same. Single-family houses, parks, open spaces. But 1 percent of our landmass, we need to go up and build these cool downtowns, and we should be providing much more robust incentives for that to happen, because it\u2019ll be \u2014 you can\u2019t ram it down people\u2019s throats.\nThe governor proposed Hochul control, not local control, where she said it was mandated that you had to build accessory dwelling units. It would have been a revolution. And it was a revolution not only from Long Island and Westchester and other places throughout the rest of the state but also in parts of Queens and Staten Island and Brooklyn as well.\nSo we need to do a better job of persuading people as to why this will make people\u2019s lives better by attracting young people into communities that are aging out, by creating affordable housing for people, as well as expanding our tax base and making life more enjoyable and improving the quality of life. So I\u2019ve been working on this for a long time. I know it very, very well, and I\u2019m very excited to have the opportunity to try and affect that as governor.\nI really have some stuff I wanted to talk to you guys about.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to get to it.\nAlex Kingsbury: We have stuff we want to talk to you about, too.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We have plenty of time.\nOK.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Alex?\nAlex Kingsbury: Yeah. In the wake of this shooting up in Buffalo, I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve thought at all about what the state can do about domestic extremism, white nationalist terrorism and the ideologies that are motivating in that sense.\nA lot of it has to do with the conversations that we\u2019re having. You know, I\u2019m the vice chairman of a group called the Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress, 29 Democrats and Republicans who meet regularly to try and find common ground. We need to be encouraging those Republicans, quite frankly, to stand up to their party, to help us with this issue, because everybody is so \u2014 under Trump right now. We need to actually be building partnerships and building trust, which is very difficult to do in this environment between Democrats and Republicans that care about their country and that see this as a scourge on the nation.\nCan I just say, one thing specifically related to Buffalo is that we have \u2014 three years ago, we passed a law in New York State called a red-flag law. One of my 15 points in my crime prevention and intervention plan is that we never implemented it.New York State\u2019s red-flag law has been in effect since 2019. Although it\u2019s not well known in many parts of the state, judges in some counties have used it to take guns away from people who appear to pose a threat to themselves or others. In Suffolk County, judges have used the law to seize more than 160 guns. We should be out selling the red-flag law. It\u2019s one of the best laws in the country.\nWe should be \u2014 there\u2019s such a long journey between making a speech and passing a law and implementing something. I\u2019m good at running government. I know how to get things done in government. And the red-flag law \u2014 I said back in January after the two cops were shot, because the mother was talking about how, my son has had these problems all these years. He\u2019s been in and out of institutions.In January, a gunman shot and killed two New York City police officers in Harlem. The officers were responding to a call about a domestic incident involving the gunman, Lashawn McNeil, and his mother, who said that her son\u2019s mental condition was \u201cvery distorted.\u201d It is not clear whether he spent time in and out of institutions. If she knew there was a red-flag law and she knew he had a gun, she could have had the gun taken away from him. Because under the red-flag law, family members, social workers, cops, teachers can say, go to the courts and say: Listen, this person shouldn\u2019t have a gun. Take this person\u2019s gun away from them.\nAnd in the case of this guy that did this awful racist massacre up in Buffalo, the cops knew about it. His teachers knew about it. He was in a mental institution for a day and a half. And his family probably knew about it. And he was the prime candidate for somebody who should have had his guns taken away from him.\nI\u2019ve talked to many cops who talk about \u2014 before the red-flag law \u2014 how they would go into a domestic disturbance or something going on in somebody\u2019s house and they\u2019d see this crazy person or they\u2019d see someone with a drug and alcohol problem who had these guns right there in the house and they\u2019d take them away and they had to give them back because no crime had been committed. The red-flag law was a way for them to take guns away from people. But we haven\u2019t implemented it.\nI was so angry when the governor made such a big deal about Washington, D.C., about need for gun control and the need to attack gun violence at the \u2014 they should be ashamed of themselves, they said \u2014 she said, after Sandy Hook. She was in Congress in 2011, 2012. She was endorsed by the N.R.A. She had a 100 percent rating from the N.R.A. right at the same time that Sandy Hook took place. And she said Congress should be ashamed, and she\u2019s pushing it off over there, when right in front of her is the red-flag law that we did. It didn\u2019t escape her lips, the word \u201cred-flag law,\u201d until I did a press conference that morning, and she brought it up as an afterthought at her press conference with a B.S. executive order.\nNick Fox: If, in this case, the cops seemed to have ignored the red-flag law, what more do you think needs to be done?\nThe state police need to be trained on the red-flag law. They\u2019re the ones who are investigating. The teachers need to be educated. The administrators need to be educated. The mental health experts need to be. The public needs to be educated. There are family members right now who are living in fear at their homes with some person who\u2019s mentally unstable or has a drug and alcohol problem, and they have a gun in the house, and they know it\u2019s a problem. Let them know that there\u2019s a way to deal with this.\nHow can it be that after this massacre took place, this wasn\u2019t \u2014 the governor wasn\u2019t talking it about every single day to try and promote the red-flag law? Because she hadn\u2019t done it, and she didn\u2019t want to admit that she hadn\u2019t done it. So instead, she\u2019s made it all about Washington, D.C. We \u2014 yes, Washington, D.C., needs to be fixed. But it\u2019s the height of hypocrisy that when she was in Washington, she had a 100 percent rating, an A rating, from the N.R.A. And she was boasting about the fact that she was endorsed by the N.R.A.\nJyoti Thottam: Can I follow up on the first part of Alex\u2019s question, on domestic extremism? How would you address that part of the challenge here? Building bridges with Republicans? What \u2014\nI think a lot of it just has to do with basic education of people. I mean, there has to be a constant \u2014 leadership matters. And what the leaders talk about matters. What the governor of New York talks about matter, and how they talk about it matters.\nYou know, if you read the New York Times editorial from Nov. 4 of last year or David Shor\u2019s article from October \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Ezra Klein\u2019s article about David Shor \u2014 how we talk about things really matters in politics. It really matters as far as being leaders. And if it\u2019s just the constant attacking, attacking, attacking, people are just going to shut down. They don\u2019t even listen. They don\u2019t even open up their minds.\nAnd there\u2019s a major educational gap that exists in America. Sixty percent of Americans, 66 percent of New Yorkers, do not graduate from college.Nearly 40 percent of Americans age 25 or older have a bachelor\u2019s degree, a Pew analysis found. In New York City, about 40 percent in that age group have a bachelor\u2019s or postgraduate degree, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. They are not like the people in this room or on this call. And we have to start talking to them in language that they understand.\nWhen Tom Suozzi is campaigning on crime and taxes and affordability, I\u2019m trying to speak to the people about the issues that they care about. Ninety-one percent of New Yorkers say that crime is a serious or very serious issue. Sixty-eight percent of New Yorkers say that Kathy Hochul is failing on crime, failing on the economy. So she\u2019s not even talking about the issues. And people say this is their No. 1 issue.\nIf you want to get the trust of the people and tell them that this extremism, extremism is happening and domestic terrorism is happening, they have to trust their leaders to speak to them about it. If it\u2019s just me attacking Donald Trump every day and attacking the Republicans every day, I\u2019m not \u2014 they\u2019re not even going to listen to me. Because it\u2019s the same old shit that they hear every day. Oh, I\u2019m on the record. There we go again, Pat Healy.\nPatrick Healy: Watch it. Got to watch it.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Nick?\nNick Fox: M.T.A. ridership has plummeted. M.T.A. revenue has plummeted. Federal funding has kept it afloat. That\u2019s going to end soon. How do you increase ridership? How do you increase revenue? And how do you continue to make the improvements that need to be done after decades of neglect?\nYou have to reduce crime. People are afraid to take the subway. Crime must be reduced. The idea that a guy got shot on a Sunday morning, yesterday, on his way to work, is terrifying to people.\nI was out campaigning all day in Queens on Saturday and the Bronx on Sunday. Everywhere I went, people were saying: The Democrats, you Democrats, you\u2019re not doing anything about crime. People are afraid to take the subway. We have to reduce crime in the subway. People have to feel safe. Leaders have to be taking the subway and showing people that it\u2019s safe. But right now, it\u2019s not credible, because it\u2019s not.\nEleanor Randolph: How do you make it safe?\nYou have to make it safe by giving the mayor what he\u2019s asking for, which is to address the bail reform problem that we have in the state.\nBy doing my 15-point crime intervention and prevention plan, which goes everywhere from giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness to red-flag laws to helping people who have mental health issues to doing prevention long term for the schools. That\u2019s going to take a lot longer time to address. But it\u2019s a [inaudible].\nWhat I would do as the governor of New York State, if I was elected governor of New York State, maybe even if I won the primary, I could do this. If I tried to do it now, nobody would come. But if I was \u2014 won the Democratic primary, I\u2019d have a meeting with 100 people in the room. I\u2019d have the mayors, I\u2019d have the police commissioners, I\u2019d have the judiciary, I\u2019d have the mental health experts, I\u2019d have the legislative leaders, I\u2019d have the parole and probation, I\u2019d have education experts, I\u2019d have community activists, and we\u2019d have a 100-person meeting. And I\u2019ve done these meetings my whole career.\nAnd I\u2019d say, \u201cListen, we\u2019re all against crime. We all want to make the subways safe. Nobody\u2019s for crime. Nobody\u2019s for the subways not being safe.\u201d\nSome people say: Well, we have \u2014 the biggest focus has got to be protecting Black and brown people that have been treated so badly by the injustices of our systems. And other people are saying: Lock them up, lock them up, lock them up.\nThe answer is somewhere taking both of these ideas together and finding a comprehensive plan. And then the job of a leader is to go sell that plan, sell it to the public and then sell it to the legislature. And if the legislature won\u2019t make a deal with you, then offer them something and say: I\u2019ll give it to you if that.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t work then do FixAlbany.com and defeat people who will not listen to what the people want and kick people out of office. So I\u2019m referencing FixAlbany.com because when I was a county executive in Nassau County, Shelly Silver and Joe Bruno wouldn\u2019t give us a cap on Medicaid. And it was killing the counties. It was killing the city in New York. It cost us hundreds of billions of dollars a year.\nAnd I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to defeat a Democrat in the Assembly. I\u2019m going to defeat a Republican in the State Senate until they start listening to us.\u201d And I defeated the Democrat in the Assembly, defeated David Sidikman and Chuck Lavine, and I defeated Nancy Larraine Hoffmann up in the upstate and Syracuse area with David Valesky. And I became the president of the New York State County Executives Association. And Shelly Silver and Joe Bruno gave us what we were looking for. So I know how to push things over the finish line with politics.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I wanted to push back a little bit because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in this room that disagrees with you that crime is a major issue. Safety is a major issue in the New York City subway right now. But the subway issues run much deeper than that. It\u2019s making sure the train runs on time \u2014\nSo I was the New York City \u2014 I was at the N.Y.U. Rudin Center Person of the Year for when I was the chairman of the New York State \u2014 what\u2019s it called now? N.Y.M.T.C., New York Metropolitan Transportation Council \u2014 I understand transportation issues, regional issues very, very well. I transformed how N.Y.M.T.C. worked [inaudible] the way it was before. Stupid bureaucracy, the politicians didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nBut I got everybody to work together throughout the entire region on transportation when I was the county executive in Nassau County. In Congress, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal, the only big bipartisan deal that has happened in Congress over the past many, many years was negotiated, the framework of it was negotiated by the Problem Solvers Caucus, of which I\u2019m the vice chairman of. I went to a meeting down in Maryland with about 20 different members of Congress, about 10 different senators, a few governors. We laid out the framework for that $1.2 trillion deal. And that was, that was bipartisan.\nMitch McConnell voted for it. That guy doesn\u2019t vote for anything, OK? He voted for it.\nAnd then, you know as part of the subject of your editorial is how it got stuck with the Democrats fighting amongst themselves, and it didn\u2019t happen until after the election, which killed us because we didn\u2019t deal with it. So there\u2019s going to be enormous amounts of money coming in for infrastructure, for the M.T.A., for mass transit that I fought for, as well as the rest of the New York delegation fought for to be included in there. So that\u2019s a very important thing.\nI believe in congestion pricing. I ran on congestion pricing in 2006, when I ran for governor against Eliot Spitzer. I got killed by it. It was before Bloomberg even talked about congestion pricing. I think that right now it should not be implemented within the next year or so. It\u2019s just not going to be, anyway, because of the stupid bureaucracy you have to go through. But people are suffering so much right now from cost that it shouldn\u2019t happen right now. But it should happen in, in about a year or so, assuming that things are better financially for people.\nNick Fox: Do you think New York State needs to change any sources of revenueThe M.T.A. is funded through a combination of fares, taxes and state aid. for the M.T.A.?\nI think there should be a dedicated source of revenue. I\u2019m not opposed to that. I don\u2019t have the answer for you right now. I got 15 people working for me on my campaign. I got 15 people working in [inaudible] County. I have 20,000 people working for me in the government. I can give you a more detailed answer. But I think we should have a dedicated source of revenue.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti?\nJyoti Thottam: Yes, Congressman, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of different issues, and I understand they\u2019re interconnected, but if you were to take office as governor, what would you make your first priority on Day 1?\nCrime. Crime is No. 1. Crime is No. 1. Taxes and affordability is No. 2. Helping our kids and troubled schools is No. 3, and corruption is No. 4.\nI\u2019ve said that since Day 1, and I challenge anybody to tell me what, Nancy with the \u2014 what\u2019s her name? \u2014 Kathy Hochul\u2019s priorities are regarding the State of New York. She\u2019s been governor for eight months. You tell me. You\u2019re The New York Times. You follow everything. You\u2019re the smartest people in the world.\nWhat is Kathy Hochul\u2019s priorities for the New York State? What is her big focus? The Buffalo Bills deal? To-go drinks?In April, Ms. Hochul legalized to-go alcoholic drinks if they are purchased with food. The measure will last for three years; after that, state legislators can decide if they want to make it permanent.\nJyoti Thottam: So crime is your No. 1 priority, just to follow up on that. A lot of the issues that you pointed to around crime and public safety, they\u2019re long-running issues. But clearly there\u2019s a worsening of public safety just in the last couple of years. So are you saying that bail reform would be the thing that would improve \u2014\nNo, I\u2019m saying that would be a 15 \u2014 I have a 15-point plan that I would use as my outline, but I would have a comprehensive meeting and bring all the players together and develop a more fulsome plan based upon the outline that I have that goes from everything from giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness to helping change Kendra\u2019s Law \u2014 to give people ability to take mentally ill people who are not taking their medication and are a danger to themselves and others and get them the treatment that they need \u2014 to implementing the red-flag law to doing a thing called ShotSpottersShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system that uses surveillance and artificial technology. While police departments in a number of large cities in the country use the technology, its methodology and effectiveness have raised concerns among experts. and gun buyback programs to doing a more effective job with the interstate commission \u2014 to lobby for changes where there\u2019s trafficking of guns going on throughout the region \u2014 to working on mental health to working on schools to \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s no one answer to this. It\u2019s a comprehensive plan that has to be done.\nThe difference is, is that I\u2019m a proven executive. I\u2019m trained as a C.P.A. and an attorney. I was the mayor of a small city for eight years. I learned how to run government. I did my 10,000 hours. I turned the place around. I got national awards for this little, small city. I became the county executive in Nassau County, one of the biggest counties in the country, bigger than 11 states, bigger than Bill Clinton\u2019s budget was when he was governor of Arkansas, which he and I have joked about.\nAnd I know how to run government, and I would build a comprehensive plan, working in conjunction with the mayor of New York City, who I have a pretty good relationship with, to try and accomplish a reduction in crime.\nNick Fox: You haven\u2019t mentioned increasing the number of cops on the streets.\nI would support increasing the number of cops on streets, and I would help to direct funding towards that.\nEleanor Randolph: Can you just talk \u2014\nAnd I would try to increase the amount of community policing that\u2019s done. You know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve gotten away from community policing. Community policing, the concept of it is that the cops actually know the people in the community and the people in the community know the cops. And there\u2019s a level of trust that exists between the two. There is very \u2014 that trust has been completely destroyed. And we have to rebuild that trust.\nNick Fox: Why do you think it\u2019s been destroyed?\nBecause of abuses by cops that have been highly publicized by a marketing campaign against the cops. You know, some of it justified, a lot of it not justified. And because of \u2014 the cops are afraid of people, quite frankly.\nAlex Kingsbury: Does it have anything to do with cops not living in the areas that they patrol?For the past half-century, police officers in New York have been allowed to live in the five boroughs of the city or in the suburban counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange.\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\nEleanor Randolph: You\u2019ve talked about this a little bit, but what did you think about the relationship between Cuomo and de Blasio \u2014\nAwful.\nEleanor Randolph: And, yeah, we can talk about Cuomo as well. But how would your relationship with Adams be? I know you said that he \u2014 you liked him, he wanted to give you a job. But give us a genuine assessment about how you think he\u2019s doing and how you would be as governor, your relationship would be with him.\nI\u2019m excited about the idea of him being the mayor and me being the governor and us working together. I think that we would be a great team of people to work together. It would be a great symbol for people of us working together.\nI think that you know as well as anybody at this table what happens in Albany, with the governor or with any elected official, is that they dangle things over your head so that they control you. They try and control you. They\u2019re trying to control the mayor the way they try to control me as county executive, the way they\u2019ve tried to control everybody. He wants mayoral control. The governor says she\u2019s going to go for mayoral control, but they don\u2019t give him mayoral control.\nEleanor Randolph: Do you think he should have control?\nAbsolutely should have mayoral control \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\n\u2026 No question about it \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\nWhat\u2019s that?\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\nI would like to see it permanently, but I\u2019m willing to settle for less than permanently.\nI believe that the chief executive should be accountable, and it would be better to have, you know \u2014 my whole thing about no wrong door and tying together education, health and human services. This comes from my experience as county executive. I ran health and human services, but I didn\u2019t run the schools, so I couldn\u2019t bring my health and human services into the schools without a lot of cajoling and begging and pleading.\nBut if you had a chief executive, like the mayor of New York City or another of the big five,The \u201cbig five\u201d are New York State\u2019s five largest cities: New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers. where they have control of both, you could integrate these services much more effectively. There\u2019s something else I want to say, and I forget now. The \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Would you \u2014\nOh, so they try to control the mayor by not giving them what they want. So he wants bail reform. That\u2019s, like, his big thing that he wants, to help with crime. But how come he hasn\u2019t spoken out against the governor?\nBecause he loves what the mayor is doing to him? Because she\u2019s sitting there at the press conference and said she was going to deal with mental health in the subways and she didn\u2019t put the R.F.P. out for two weeks until Michelle Go is pushed in front of a subway station? Did a big press conference: We\u2019re going to do mental health in the subways. Didn\u2019t even put the R.F.P. out.On Jan. 6, more than a week before Michelle Go was pushed to her death in front of a moving train in the Times Square subway station, Ms. Hochul announced she would issue an immediate request for proposals to help support a subway safety plan. The request for proposals was released on Jan. 21, six days after the attack.\nSo I would help the mayor, as a person who understands what it\u2019s like to be the chief executive of a local government, and other mayors throughout the state and county executives and help them to run their municipalities instead of just holding things over their head. This is a game that is played by the State Legislature and by the governors to try and control the local officials to stop them from campaigning against them.\nAnd quite frankly, if the mayor couldn\u2019t get what he wants and I couldn\u2019t get what I want, which is pretty much the same as what he wants, I would try and persuade the mayor that he and I should team up together to clean out Albany. Because it\u2019s a broken system. There\u2019s no competition. The problem that exists in our country, in Congress, the problem that exists in the New York State Legislature, is everybody\u2019s seat is safe. And when a seat is safe, they don\u2019t listen to the people. The only way they can lose their seat is by losing a primary. And very few people, as we know, vote in the primaries. The far right votes in the Republican primaries, and the far left votes in the Democratic primaries. So the Democrats pander to the left, Republicans pander to the right, and nobody listens to what the people want in the middle.\nIf the people want you to do something about crime, how can it be that the government is not working on crime? How can it be the legislature is not \u2014 why isn\u2019t there a hearing every day on this? It\u2019s the No. 1 issue. How can that be? How can it be?\nWe have the highest taxes in the United States of America. We lost the SALT deduction.The SALT deduction, or the state and local tax deduction, allows taxpayers to deduct eligible state and local taxes on their federal returns. In 2017, Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which capped the deduction at $10,000 per year. People are leaving the state, despite what Mr. Appelbaum says. People are leaving the state in droves. Everybody knows somebody that moved to Florida, moved to North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Philly. How can it be that they\u2019re not talking about this stuff?\nBecause they\u2019re not afraid of the people. Democracy doesn\u2019t work. People are dying in Ukraine for freedom and democracy. What is democracy? It\u2019s politics. It\u2019s supposed to be that the people get what they want from the elected officials and if they don\u2019t get it, they kick them out. But they\u2019re not afraid of getting kicked out. They don\u2019t lose. Nobody loses.\nCongress has a 15 percent approval rating. Ninety percent get re-elected. And the state legislatures has a terrible reputation. They all get re-elected. How can that be?\nSo you need competition. You need people who are going to come in and say: We\u2019re going to do what the people want. So I\u2019m fighting for the people. I have a heart for the people, and I have the skills to get the job done. And I need The New York Times to help me win this race.\nNick Fox: You think you\u2019d have a better shot at Hochul if you were running in a general election? Obviously if \u2014\nI\u2019d have a great shot if she wasn\u2019t the sitting governor. Could you imagine if Kathy Hochul was the lieutenant governor who just was running for office? She didn\u2019t have access to this money that she\u2019s raised. It\u2019s an enormous amount of money. I mean, what is she running on?\nAll she\u2019s got is a huge bunch of money that was given, that \u2014 in campaign fundsAs of late May, Ms. Hochul has reportedly raised a $31.7 million, largely from real estate and other special interests, including building trades, hospitals and labor unions. that she got from \u2014 $250,000 from every lobbyist, every cannabis provider, every nursing home, every developer, which has a huge pile of money. Then she\u2019s got all this money that came from the federal government and all this money that came from Wall Street. She\u2019s giving it away. She\u2019s not dealing with [inaudible] we\u2019re going to see a downturn in the economy.\nAre we going to be prepared for a downturn in the economy? We already have the highest taxes in the United States of America. We have massive amounts of debt. We have spent Medicaid two and a half times the cost to the national average. We spend more per student than any state in the United States of America. Why aren\u2019t we using this money to, like, fix this stuff, to be ready for the long term?\nInstead, it\u2019s this one over here, that one over there. Buffalo Bills, Kensington Expressway. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2014 $350 million for Long Island legislators to get their votes, with no hearing? We don\u2019t even know what the $350 million is for yet. Just to get their votes, you get $350 million. Wasn\u2019t even part of her budget, wasn\u2019t part of the State Senate budget. It wasn\u2019t part of the Assembly budget. This is happening all over the place. That\u2019s just the ones what we know about.\nMara Gay: We\u2019ve got a lightning round for you.\nWhere is the lightning round? I still got all my stuff I wanted to share with you guys.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We still have 25 minutes.\nMara Gay: It\u2019s just to break things up. It\u2019s actually supposed to be fun.\nOh, ooh.\nMara Gay: What\u2019s the cost of a single subway or bus ride?\n$2.25?\nMara Gay: $2.75. Under what circumstances are abortions allowed in New York past 24 weeks?\nThe life of the mother. Health of the mother.\nMara Gay: And also if the fetus is not viable, yes. What is the average cost of SUNY tuition, including room and board, for one year?\nI don\u2019t know. $12,000?\nMara Gay: $23,350.\nOh, golly.\nMara Gay: Where did you go on your last vacation?\nHmm. I don\u2019t know. Florida? Florida?\nMara Gay: What\u2019s the median sale price of a home in Rochester? A guesstimate is fine.\n$140,000?\nMara Gay: 180,000. In White Plains?\n450,000? 500,000?\nMara Gay: 730,000. In Staten Island?\n800,000?\nMara Gay: 640,000. What about the median rent in Brooklyn?\n2,500? 3,000? 2,500! 2,500.\nMara Gay: It\u2019s 2,998. And what was your favorite class in high school?\nMath, probably. It\u2019s very straightforward.\nMara Gay: Great. Thank you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You\u2019ve touched on, several times today, questions about the economy. As you mentioned, we are perhaps headed toward a downturn. What do you think the single most important thing to be doing right now, in terms of economic growth, is for the State of New York?\nLowering taxes. And I\u2019m a Democrat. But that\u2019s \u2014 we can\u2019t survive. People are leaving. They\u2019re just leaving.\nI know that you\u2019ve got \u2014 Mr. Appelbaum says the data doesn\u2019t prove it, but I see it. I hear it every single day. You hear it every single day. People are leaving.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So not jobs? You\u2019re not hearing \u2014\nWe need that to create jobs. We need to \u2014 I believe that the biggest opportunity for New York State is north of Putnam and Rockland County. There is huge opportunity there.\nI just was up in Buffalo the other day with the Bangladeshi community. I had a meeting with, like, 300 Bangladeshis. They left Queens. They bought foreclosed homes in Buffalo, and they\u2019ve completely transformed neighborhoods.\nI believe that there are huge opportunities to take the power and energy of the diversity of New York City and provide opportunities for people to move to different parts of the state to try and create centers, you know, tech centers. See, but right now, if you go north of Putnam and Rockland County, if you don\u2019t have a college or a jail or a hospital or a major tourism destination, you\u2019re dead. You can\u2019t possibly make it. There\u2019s no shot that you can make it.\nWe pass all these rules in New York from New York, that emanate from New York City. And New York City can take it because it\u2019s the financial capital of the world. We have Wall Street. We have insurance. We\u2019ve got real estate. We have tourism. We have entertainment. We can take it.\nAnd the downstate suburbs, they\u2019re feeding off of the mother ship. And we can take it, you know, except the property tax, but we can take it, for the most part.\nYou go upstate, you have all this oppression coming down on small businesses and on families and people who can\u2019t afford to live here. They can\u2019t take it. They\u2019re crushed. It\u2019s the poorest place. Spitzer said this is Appalachia. And he\u2019s right.\nPatrick Healy: Which taxes would you cut, and what would you give Democrats in the legislature to get a deal?\nWe\u2019d have to cut property taxes by increasing state aid. We\u2019ve been increasing state aid enormously. We should be tying increases in state aid to reduction in property taxes because the property taxes are regressive.\nThe first thing I would do, as far as property taxes, would be to give a break for senior citizens, people that are house rich and income poor. People on Long Island that moved there 50 years ago and bought their house for $50,000 and now they\u2019re worth $700,000.\nOr people that moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant. When I worked in Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1986 at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Housing Project and the whole place was derelict and bombed out, people bought places for $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000. Now they\u2019re worth a million or $2 million, but they can\u2019t afford to pay the property taxes because they\u2019re house rich but they\u2019re income poor.\nSenior citizens on a fixed income shouldn\u2019t have to pay above a certain percentage of their income in property taxes. It\u2019s the most regressive thing.\nPatrick Healy: You ran on property taxes before, though. It didn\u2019t work. Why is it that New Yorkers \u2014\nBecause I was running against Eliot Spitzer. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing. And he was the sheriff of Wall Street.\nPatrick Healy: Right.\nAnd he had an enormous amounts of money, and \u2014\nPatrick Healy: Why doesn\u2019t it resonate, though? Like, in terms of going up against \u2014\nNo, no. It did resonate. It resonated with Eliot Spitzer. He appointed me a year later as chairman of the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief, and David Paterson reappointed me as chairman of the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief. And I wrote the report as to why property taxes are so high in New York State and what we needed to do, which was a property tax cap, which we got outside of New York City.\nWe need an increase in state aid, and we need to do a circuit breaker. Fifteen years ago I wrote that report, and it\u2019s still the same problem.\nPatrick Healy: Can I just ask one other question on the economy, just about inflation. A lot of voters, a lot of people who might be attracted to Tom Suozzi just see themselves getting whacked in so many different ways on inflation. I mean, what is an idea that you, as governor, could execute on? Is there anything that doesn\u2019t involve legislature?\nI proposed a gas tax suspension back in January. And the only reason I \u2014 and listen, let me say it very clearly, OK? In Congress I\u2019ve spoken out very strongly. I\u2019m in favor of increasing taxes at the federal level. That\u2019s increasing taxes at the federal level so that wherever you go in the country, you\u2019ve got to pay more in taxes.\nAnd I\u2019d love to go back to revenue sharing, whereby you increase the taxes at the federal level and we get back the money that we sent you from, from New York so we can use the money to fix our own problems here in New York State. But I\u2019m against increasing taxes at the state level because we\u2019re pushing people out of New York State.\nWhen I was 1,In the early 1960s, when Mr. Suozzi was 1, 43 House members represented New York State. The state\u2019s population has increased since then, but other states have grown far more rapidly, which accounts for the reallocation of congressional seats. there were 45 members of Congress from New York State, based on our relative population. Today there\u2019s 27 members of Congress. It\u2019s going down to 26, and it\u2019s going to keep on going down.\nSo I would only propose a gas tax holiday in the context of, No. 1, we\u2019ve got all this money coming in for infrastructure. I said publicly, in Congress, many times, on Ways and Means, \u201cI will vote for a gas tax increase in Washington for infrastructure.\u201d I\u2019ve said that publicly. Everybody [inaudible] talks about infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. We\u2019re going to pay for it. I said, \u201cI will vote for a [inaudible] tax increase.\u201d Who else will do it? I knew we would do it, obviously. So I\u2019m all in favor of increasing gas taxes at the federal level, increasing income taxes at the federal level.\nBut New York State is dying. We cannot go this \u2014 it\u2019s climate change, OK?\nI was a New York State environmentalist of the year for the League of Conservation Voters. Al Gore gave me awards for cleaning up polluted sites when I was mayor of little Glen Cove, for cleaning up Superfund sites and hazardous waste sites. I did all kinds of programs. I\u2019m on the Green New Deal, OK? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I are like this in a lot of things, but I\u2019m with her on the Green New Deal.\nI\u2019m all for the federal government investing massive amounts of money in addressing climate change. But we can\u2019t just do it in New York State by ourselves, because we do it by ourselves in New York State, our utility rates are going to continue to go up, and the people who can least afford to pay utility rates are the ones who hurt the most. They can\u2019t afford to pay increased utility rates.\nI do these telephone town halls, about 120,000 people, registered Democrats on telephone town halls. Every call is the same \u2014 crime, taxes and affordability, which is often utility rates. People can\u2019t take it.\nSo we can\u2019t do this stuff in New York where we push the businesses out of New York. They leave the Southern Tier, and they go to Pennsylvania. They\u2019re continuing to do the same exact pollution they were doing when they were in New York. It\u2019s still contributing to global warming. It\u2019s still bad. But we lost the tax base in the jobs in the process.\nNick Fox: What services would you cut to compensate for the tax cuts?\nNo, they would not pay for themselves. Medicaid is the main thing you have to do. Two and a half times the cost of the national average. We spend more than Texas and Florida combined on Medicaid, even though Texas and Florida are both bigger than New York State. I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of people about this. This is a little bit longer, but I fought for the Medicaid cap. New York State\u2019s the only state in the country that used to be 50 percent was paid by the feds, 25 percent by the state, 25 percent by the local governments.\nI was out in Nassau County \u2014 it was the worst-run county in America \u2014 transforming it, technology, fighting with the unions, doing all this stuff to try and change things. And the cops support me now, just so you know, even though I used to fight with them about their pay out of Long Island. \u201cIt\u2019s way too high,\u201d I said. I\u2019m doing all these things to try to reform.\nI raised taxes 19 percent my first year as a county executive. I\u2019m doing all this stuff to reform Nassau County, but my Medicare costs were going up 13 percent a year. I had no say over it whatsoever. So I did this thing, Fix Albany, where I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat a Democratic Assembly, Republican State Senate, [inaudible] Democrats until you get us a Medicaid cap.\u201d\nI won the elections. I became the president of the County Executive Association, and I got a Medicaid cap of 3.5 percent a year. It then went down to 3 percent a year. When Cuomo came in, he reduced it as a big favor to the cities and the counties, the City of New York and the counties. He reduced it to zero. But now there\u2019s no accountability whatsoever by the cities and counties.\nNew York City spends 90 percent of the money in the entire country on home health care aids, on long-term care.In 2020, Medicaid spending, which funds home care and long-term care programs, was roughly $5 billion in New York City, about 5 percent of the city\u2019s budget. There\u2019s so much fraud going on where people literally say: I\u2019m going to send my parents to go to this adult day care facility. Nobody really goes to these adult day care facilities. Some people sign the paperwork saying that they\u2019re there, then the provider gives them a kickback, but nobody actually goes.\nIt\u2019s a cottage industry of fraud that\u2019s taking place every day. And there\u2019s historical fraud. It\u2019s always been going on in the nursing homes. And so I have a bill in Congress to actually deal with long-term care, called the Wish Act, which is to take care of catastrophic care. So long-term health care insurance could actually be affordable for people again.\nMara Gay: Can we talk about your path to victory?\nYes. New York Times has to endorse me.\nMara Gay: What are you doing to build your winning coalition, and where are those voters, and who are they?\nLong Island is very important to me. Westchester is very important to me.\nLatinos are very important to me. Diana Reyna is my running mate. Twelve years as a city councilwoman in Brooklyn, four years as deputy borough president to Eric Adams, first Dominican woman elected in the history of New York State. When she\u2019s elected lieutenant governor, she\u2019d be the first Latina elected statewide in the history of New York. Freddy Ferrer, Fernando Ferrer is the chairman of our campaign. Latino voters are very concerned about crime. I\u2019m working very hard to cultivate Latinos.\nMuslims are very important. They\u2019re a huge growing population. They never vote. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time going to iftars and different events and just giving attention to the community. There\u2019s some African Americans, mainly Caribbeans, that I think I have a very good shot with.\nSo I got to do very well in Long Island, in Westchester. I\u2019ve got to do better in Queens than the other boroughs. I\u2019ve got to do better in Staten Island, but I haven\u2019t really put much attention into it yet. And I got to well in the Bronx. I think that there are anti-crime voters all over the state that are looking for someone to actually just hear what they\u2019re saying and do something about it. And so I\u2019ve raised $8 million so far. I\u2019ve got to raise about another $2 million. And if I raise $2 million and I get The New York Times endorsement, I can win the race.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You\u2019ve been pretty critical of Governor Hochul in this meeting. What\u2019s one thing you think she\u2019s done well so far as governor? Is there anything?\nShe\u2019s a very hard worker. She works very hard. I think that she lacks the executive experience to do this job. And I think she lacks the political experience to do the job. She\u2019s good at politics, as far as, you know, making speeches and going to visit people. And as far as, you know, she\u2019s getting a lot of groups to support her.\nBut as far as negotiating with the legislature, she got the Buffalo Bills. She did the whole process to get the Buffalo Bills. A billion dollars to keep the Buffalo Bills that nobody wanted. And she gave up everything for that. She\u2019s giving the money to the Buffalo Bills so that they don\u2019t leave. What does she do to stop the people from leaving New York State?\nEleanor Randolph: Wait \u2014\nI talk about the four Bs with the governor. I\u2019m going to continue to be critical, I\u2019m sorry, but: the Buffalo Bills, Brian Benjamin \u2014 her first decision that she made, blindly went into it.\nThere was all kinds of report about his ethical scandals that were going on. It came up again in November that he didn\u2019t fill out his, his questionnaires properly about being subpoenaed, and she still continued to double down and then tripled down on him, even after he\u2019d been called in by the F.B.I. a week before. It\u2019s just gross mismanagement and, and bad judgment.\nSo Brian Benjamin, the Buffalo Bills, the budget \u2014 secretive, most secretive process ever, not addressing the long-term fiscal problems \u2014 and bail reform. But really, crime overall. Just not making it a priority.\nEleanor Randolph: I mean, to bounce off that \u2014\nOh, just another thing. Can I say one more thing?\nEleanor Randolph: Of course.\nSo she has a 37 percent job approval rating. If you don\u2019t want Lee Zeldin to become the governor of New York State, you should endorse Tom Suozzi for governor, because she could lose the race. I won\u2019t lose to him. He can\u2019t beat me on Long Island. He can\u2019t beat me on crime and taxes.\nBut if you\u2019re worried about the progressive agenda that we care about, if you\u2019re worried about choice, if you\u2019re worried about any of the things that we \u2014 that The Times cares about, she could lose the race.\nEleanor Randolph: So you haven\u2019t said anything about Jumaane Williams. How would you feel if you split the vote with Hochul, and he actually got the primary?\nI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. He doesn\u2019t \u2014 first off, he\u2019s got a lot of volunteers and a lot of grass-roots support. And I have tremendous respect and admiration for him as a person. He does not have any money. And I don\u2019t think that, unlike the previous race, we had Cynthia Nixon at the top of the ticket, which we had money and celebrity to, to run the race. I don\u2019t think he has any chance of getting over 15 or 20 percent. So as a matter of fact, in my polling, his numbers actually went down from 14 percent down to 12 percent.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So assuming you win the primary, we\u2019ve seen in several recent gubernatorial elections across the country that issues, curriculum issues like C.R.T. and book banning, etc., have become major issues. Are you concerned about those issues here in New York? But also, just more generally, if you look across the state, what would you change in terms of education? I know you\u2019ve talked about bringing health and human services into schools, but is there anything else that you would want to do right away?\nI\u2019d like to move away from mandates to guidelines. And for school districts that \u2014 because I think the school districts spent an awful lot of time trying to comply with the rules. And the state spends a lot of time checking the boxes and filling out forms on a lot of the different rules. And if a school is performing well, based upon graduation rates, test scores, whatever we decide we want it to be, we should be giving teachers and administrators more freedom to run their schools.\nAnd for those schools that are troubled schools, where the kids are failing and they don\u2019t have a shot, you know, I\u2019m very sensitive to this because in Nassau County, we have the best schools in the United States of America in different places. We\u2019re also home to Hempstead and Roosevelt, which have left these kids behind for generations.\nSo we should be focusing our resources from the state level to help troubled school districts and leave the other school districts alone and let them just, you know, use guidelines. And if they\u2019re performing well, leave them alone.\nPatrick Healy: But is there a mandate you specifically dislike?\nYeah, but I\u2019m not going to get into that.\nPatrick Healy: Come on.\nEleanor Randolph: And curriculum?\nAlex Kingsbury: Competitions encourage leadership, right?\nYeah, we\u2019re not stupid, though. I\u2019ll lead when I\u2019m the governor.\nEleanor Randolph: So are there \u2014\nWe have more mandates in New York State than any other state in the United States of America.\nPatrick Healy: Yeah, you can pick one.\nEleanor Randolph: Curriculum mandates or no?\nNo. Really, special education mandates are really very, very onerous and ineffective. And these kids are getting left behind because of all these rules that are put in place that stop people with good hearts who are trying to do their job to help these kids, and they\u2019re, they\u2019re, this is \u2014\nMara Gay: What do you think of the rules that govern religious schools? And do you think that they should be strengthened, as some advocates in ultra-Orthodox communities say their children aren\u2019t being educated? Or do you that think we should just let those kids get the education that those schools \u2014\nYou know, in the case of the yeshiva schools, for example, or even Catholic schools, you know, 99 percent of them are very good.\nMara Gay: And those who aren\u2019t?\nAnd those who aren\u2019t, you should be calling them out and trying to send a task force in there to try and persuade them to change.\nMara Gay: That has not worked. What would you do to fix it?\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that it hasn\u2019t worked. I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s effectively tried to do that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti?\nJyoti Thottam: I just wanted to follow up. Since you raised this idea a few times that people are fleeing New York \u2014\nYeah. Yeah.\nJyoti Thottam: \u2014 because the taxes are too high. Do you have any data of your own to support that?\nJust things that I read here and there. Eighty thousand people applied for a Florida driver\u2019s license from New York State last year.More than 60,000 New Yorkers applied for a Florida driver\u2019s license in 2021, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. We have 315,000 \u2014 we have the largest net out-migration of any state in the United States of America in 2021From mid-2020 to mid-2021, New York experienced a larger net domestic migration outflow than any other state relative to its size. According to the Empire Center, the state lost more than 300,000 residents, many of whom left New York City. This is part of a broader trend of people moving out of large metro areas and is largely consistent with prepandemic trends. \u2014 314,000 person net out-migration, more than New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois and four smaller states combined.\nWe\u2019ve gone from, as I said, it\u2019s been going on for a long time, which Mr. Appelbaum likes to talk about all the time, but we went from 45 members of Congress down to 27 members of Congress. And it\u2019s going down to 26 next year. So as far as what the cause is, I believe that SALT was a big factor. But I\u2019ve abandoned that quest. And we have to reduce the taxes in New York State. And we have to improve the quality of life by addressing crime.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Greg?\nGreg Bensinger: Hi. In another lifetime, I was a member of the campaign finance board. I\u2019m curious what you think about these reports about your running mate and her obligations, her past obligations to the C.F.B.Diana Reyna reportedly owes the New York City Campaign Finance Board more than $138,000, stemming from a City Council campaign in 2009, when she spent less on qualified expenditures than she received through the city\u2019s matching funds.\nShe\u2019s got to pay the money back. She\u2019s got to pay it back.\nGreg Bensinger: Why is that not a concern when you picked her as a running mate?\nBecause of the fact that it\u2019s not like she did something wrong. She was in a race against the machine, against Vito Lopez. And her treasurer quit in the middle of the campaign, and she\u2019s always said that she will pay. If she\u2019s elected, she\u2019ll pay the money back. She doesn\u2019t have the money otherwise, Greg.\nI\u2019ve proposed a couple of different things regarding campaign finance. I have a six-point government accountability plan, of which one is that the state limit should be reduced from what is now $67,000 for the statewide candidates. We should just adopt the federal rules of $2,900.\nI\u2019ve also suggested that we should have quarterly reporting requirements, because right now the last report was in January and the next one\u2019s not due until the end of this month. I also believe in public finance. But I\u2019m not campaigning on that.\nIn law school, I received the New York State Bar Association\u2019s ethics award for the work that I did on the New York State Commission on Government Integrity, I think it was called, with the dean of my law school, Dean Ferrick, wrote that report, and I did the pro bono work working on that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time, but we haven\u2019t actually talked about Covid yet. We\u2019re still in the middle of what is right now an upswing in cases. What needs to be done in terms of looking ahead? What do you think the state needs to be doing in terms of trying to bring Covid under control \u2014\nThe state needs to do it.\nKathleen Kingsbury: And help the public live with Covid from here on out.\nSorry, not that I want to be Johnny One Note, but I was very critical of the governor when we dealt with Covid before. Right after I announced, literally two days after I announced, my campaign staff was very mad at me.\nI noticed that the cases had come from 3,400 to 6,800 cases. Now, what was it? I don\u2019t know if they were reported cases. They seem like such small numbers now, but I can\u2019t remember. The cases had doubled from the beginning of October, I mean from the beginning of November to the end of November. And it was right after Thanksgiving. I was like, wow, we\u2019re about to go through a holiday surge. It\u2019s got to be \u2014 you know, Omicron had just been reported, the first, No. 1 case.\nI said we need a multifaceted, comprehensive plan to promote boosters, to promote vaccines, to encourage mask wearing, to have more testing sites. To do this thing, where you say this is a hot spot, you know, because with the Times report, which is very valuable that you guys do. But you know, at the time, it was like 15 percent infection rate in Buffalo, but it was only 2 percent rate, or 1\u00bd percent rate in New York City. And we need to be flooding resources as far as marketing, especially, but also other resources for testing into places where the problems are particularly bad.\nSo I believe very strongly that mandates are such a toxic thing in our culture right now because of Trump and because of everything that the Republicans have done with this and some of the mismarketing by the Democrats that we really need to go out and sell this to people. We need to build.\nI\u2019m a very big believer in taking very disparate viewpoints and then trying to find a comprehensive solution that finds middle ground and then going out and selling it to the people. We should be having hospitals and doctors, which have these massive email lists \u2014 they should be sending it out to their patients, asking people to get their booster shots and educating people as to what to do. We should be having celebrities. It can\u2019t [inaudible] Dr. Fauci and the C.D.C., and then you had, you know, Trump and the anti-vaxxers.\nWe need to have some trusted people that people are familiar with out selling the idea of vaccines and masks and the other stuff that people need to be doing. So it\u2019s really a big marketing effort. It\u2019s a leadership effort. It\u2019s an idea of selling to the people what they need to be doing, because if we just try and mandate it, we\u2019re going to have a further fracturing of our society.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time. I wanted to end on asking you, what do you see as just your greatest accomplishment as a member of Congress? Just one.\nI would say probably \u2014 I\u2019m going to get in trouble now \u2019cause I haven\u2019t thought about this. I would probably say the $1.2 trillion for the infrastructure deal. I helped to change the rules in Congress on getting bills on the floor. We had a big fight with Nancy Pelosi when she first got elected and won, and it actually made things much more open. I mean, I didn\u2019t change the culture very much.\nI dramatically increased the funding for the Long Island Sound by 5 \u2014 900 percent to clean up the Long Island Sound. Got the money in to clean up the Bethpage bloom. It\u2019s been there for 40 years. It was one of these comprehensive things, when I brought in the E.P.A., the D.E.C. They let local elected officials, the Army Corps, the commissioner \u2014 I got a whole list of things I\u2019ve done, quite frankly.\nEleanor Randolph: Just one.\nI can\u2019t think of just one.\nNick Fox: Can I just ask one more, please?\nOh, the Congressional Gold Medal for the Harlem HellfightersIn 2021, Mr. Suozzi introduced legislation that awarded the Harlem Hellfighters, an African American infantry regiment in World War I, a Congressional Gold Medal. was a big deal.\nNick Fox: Can you mention any notable endorsements you\u2019ve had?\nThe I.B.E.W. And my wife.\nKathleen Kingsbury: That seems like a good note to end on.", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/12/opinion/tom-suozzi-nyt-interview.html", "tags": [{"label":

In a landmark ruling by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that it is time \u201cto return the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d In effect that means that millions of people \u2013 mostly in conservative states \u2013 will imminently lose access to abortion in America. The three liberal justices who dissented wrote \u201cwith sorrow\u201d that \u201cone result of today\u2019s decision is certain: the curtailment of women\u2019s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\u201d\n\u2018We're Hurtling Into A Reactionary Future\u2019\nTimes Opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg, Times Opinion editor Lauren Kelley and the writer Leah Libresco Sargeant discuss what comes next with Times Opinion podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro.\nMichelle, I want to begin with you. What was your initial reaction when you heard the news?\nObviously I knew this was coming. I never had any hope that the leaked draft wasn't essentially what the Court was going to do, but I still really feel like I've been punched in the stomach.\nEven when I tried to remind myself that liberties are always frail and progress isn't eternal, it just feels like we have been cast back into a radically different nation than the one I expected to raise my children in.\nLauren, you cover reproductive rights. Tell us what this decision means in plain English. It was a long decision, several dozen pages, but what does it actually mean?\nIt means that Roe v. Wade is fully overturned, which is both something that is so straightforward and simple in some way, but is also just absolutely remarkable.\nIt was really very, very recent that we were told by many of the pundits in this country and experts who follow the Supreme Court that Roe v. Wade would not be fully overturned. And it certainly wouldn't be overturned fully in an election year. I think as recently as just before the oral arguments for this Dobbs decision \u2013 December 1st I believe \u2013 the thinking was really: Well, there might be some sort of compromise. They might roll it back. But this full overturning just was not on the table in a lot of people's eyes.\nAnd to just see that window shift so quickly in this last nine months or so. It's just actually kind of dizzying.\nLeah, you're opposed to abortion. And I'd like to get your reaction to today's ruling. What did you feel when it came down, even though you knew it was coming?\nIt's kind of dizzying. The first protest march I ever went to was in utero with my mom, who took me to a pro-choice march. So for me, this is an issue I've changed my mind about as I've grown up and as I've learned more about babies in the womb, and as I've thought more expansively about what support women need and deserve.\nSo, it's good to see an opinion that undoes the injustice of Roe, but obviously we don't have a culture that fully supports women. I'd like this to be a day that everyone feels relief in the same way I hope we would if a different Supreme Court precedent, Buck v. Bell, had been stricken down, which legitimized incredible prejudice and involuntary sterilization of the disabled.\nBut I know this isn't a happy day for a lot of Americans and I just, I wish we had a culture that supported women more and gave people more reason to hope that we can take care of everyone who's vulnerable.\nLeah, I just want to stay with you for a moment. And if you can explain to me, when you say that you changed your mind on this, what did that look like? Why have you landed where you have landed in your opinion?\nSo the thing I've agreed with the whole time is Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted abortion upheld, not as a right to privacy, but as a right to equal protection under the law.\nAnd she made the case that abortion is really the price of admission to society we demand of women. And I think she's factually right. That's what we ask of women. We don't support women when they're pregnant, even with wanted pregnancies. We don't support parents nationwide. We place heavy burdens on parents who are most vulnerable. TANF, which is support for needy families, has been hollowed out. The child allowance didn't make it to parents who were the poorest.\nSo it's true, you can look around and say, our culture has no room for the vulnerable. It doesn't have room for babies who are vulnerable and it doesn't have room for women who are vulnerable. So abortion is a crutch that lets us navigate that hatred of dependence that's pervasive in our culture. I think it's one more mark of a sexist society that we take the burdens we put on the vulnerable, then lay them heavily on women and demand an act of violence to have equal access to society.\nMichelle, I just want to get your understanding of why you support a woman's right to choose.\nSure. I've often said that the question for me in abortion is not whether a fetus is a person, it's whether a woman is a person and a woman\u2019s desire for equality. The fact that the state does not support dependency is one reason that women get abortions, but it is by no means the only reason.\nI'm sure I would agree with Leah that no woman should have to get an abortion because she can't afford a wanted pregnancy. Although obviously today's decision does nothing to support the women who will now be forced to go forward with pregnancies that they either can't afford or desperately don't want.\nBut there is just something so deeply invasive, degrading and dehumanizing about being forced to be pregnant against your will, about being forced to give birth, which is an experience of pain unlike any that most people will ever experience in their lives \u2013 it's a degree of pain that would be considered torture in any other circumstance \u2013 that the state can force you to do that, that it can force you to give up your body in a way that it would never force you to give up your house, in a way that it would never force you to give up an organ.\nYou know, the state can't compel you to donate a kidney to save someone's life. It can't compel you to donate your blood, but it can compel you \u2013 it can take from you your bodily autonomy. It is just an invasion and there is no way around it. I support all of the same policies that I'm sure Leah does, but none of those will ever change the fact that forced pregnancy and forced birth puts women in a position of second-class citizenship.\nAnd then there's a second-order concern, which is just that the regime necessary to sustain an abortion ban is invasive at best, and totalitarian at worst, because it's just going to require a massive amount of surveillance of women and their choices.\nIn countries that ban abortion \u2013 and I've been to many of them \u2013 you constantly see miscarriages investigated and in some cases, criminalized, because the line between a miscarriage and an abortion is not clear. And so this is dangerous, not just for women who are going to affirmatively try to end unwanted pregnancies. It is dangerous for any woman who might get pregnant, period. I'm past that, but I mourn the world that I'm leaving for my daughter.\nI'm gonna jump in and say this. I had an abortion. It was incredibly traumatic. It has left me with a very nuanced view of this issue, which I never felt the political rhetoric ever fully addressed: that I can at the same time support a woman's right to choose, and yet have very conflicted feelings about when and where that should happen.\nAnd I know Lauren, you've been reporting on abortion for a long time and editing many writers on this topic and doing a huge amount of research and talking to women who've had abortions. And one of your takeaways has been that opinions on abortion in this country are very nuanced.\nSure, over the course of doing this job over the years, I've spoken to many, many women who've had abortions. I've talked to many abortion providers, and it is really quite striking actually how, when you talk to people about their experiences, like your experience, Lulu, that you just shared with us, and even abortion providers in many cases, the things that they have to say about abortion often are really quite divorced from the sort of political, national debate about this issue.\nThere is a lot of nuance in people's personal feelings about this issue, and again, even in abortion providers\u2019 feelings about doing this work. But I would just say that something very, very simple sort of gets lost here. And that's that abortion is just a reality. You hear people sort of throw around the statistic that one in four women in their lifetime in America will have an abortion, and that is true. It's almost become sort of a slogan in a way, or a bumper sticker.\nBut it also is just this basic starting point that I think we don't start from often enough: that abortion is inevitable. You cannot stop people from getting abortions. We have seen it year after year after year for decades, for centuries, really. And we're just looking at this future where so many more women are going to end up in desperate situations and desperate to not be pregnant, and their choices are going to be few and far between. And whether you want abortion to exist or not, it exists, and it is going to keep existing. And I think that's just the place we have to start from now going forward into this great abyss that we're in.\nLeah, we know that laws like this impact Black and Brown women, poor women, the most. They're the ones who will bear the brunt of this decision. The United States is now one of only a handful of countries to actively roll back existing abortion protections. As someone who wanted to see the end of Roe, what's your response to the concern that women who won't be able to get an abortion are poor women?\nI appreciate your question, especially about America's exceptional status in the world, because America was exceptional before today. America had some of the most expansive laws in terms of access to abortion in the world. It's much more common across Europe to have nearer total bans, except for life of the mother, after 12 weeks than it is in America. And even then, that affects a small minority of abortions. The vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester.\nAmericans when polled both favor upholding Roe, but also favor restrictions that are incompatible with Roe, which include heavy restrictions from the second trimester onward. So people have really mixed feelings, and America has had for years a much more expansive sense of when and if it would be permissible to end a life than the rest of the world.\nI don't want to discount the racial or poverty impact at all, because every single law we pass has a disparate impact on people who are not white, people who are poor, people who are vulnerable by any kind of identity marker. I'd contrast this with the laws we have around child protection services, which I think we'd all agree on this call are an important part of what the state does. The state exists to protect people who are vulnerable, who need the intervention from someone who can speak for them when they're placed in danger or abused and don't have the ability to escape or seek redress.\nBut it's absolutely the case that the American child protective service system and the foster care system is discriminatory towards poor parents, towards Black parents. It'll take children from a house where the parents can't take care of them because they're poor and then subsidize foster parents to take care of the children when the original parents needed the money. I see the solution to this as fighting against racism in our society and in our law, but not at dismantling laws or giving up on protecting the vulnerable. I don't think we can do without child protective services, but I think we need a massive overhaul in how it works.\nMichelle, I'd like you to respond to that. When you hear Leah talk about this, what are you hearing?\nSo look, I've had two kids and one second-trimester miscarriage. So I feel like after you have children, or at least for me, having children gave me an appreciation of the value of the fetus that I didn't have as a younger pro-choice activist. I know very well we're not just talking about a clump of cells. I know very well that we're talking about something that is a life, even if you don't believe it is a full person. And I understand that it's often something that is morally, quite fraught and complicated and anguishing, even if for other women it's quite straightforward.\nBut what I don't hear from Leah or other people is what you say to a person who is in front of you screaming, I don't want this to happen to me. And your answer is essentially: I feel bad for you. I want to help you. But at the end of the day, too bad.\nI think the answer to suffering is accompaniment in it, provision of all material help that we can possibly give. I think in America that often involves a mix of both private charity and public law changes and help in just accessing the aids we've already ostensibly passed for vulnerable women, but then we don't make it available to them. We offload all the administrative work of our welfare state onto \u2013\nRight, but there is essentially \u2013 there's a harm of pregnancy. There's travail and pain and transformation involved that that cannot be, it can be kind of ameliorated. But essentially, if pregnancy itself is the thing that is much more dangerous than abortion, and again, you are saying that women should have to go through that against their will. And I think all these other supports are nice, and I think we can both agree that they're necessary, but none of them change that essential fact.\nListening to you both talk, what strikes me is that a lot of the discussion around Roe had been that Roe is inherently divisive. But what I'm hearing from both of you is these very deeply held beliefs. And so Lauren, I suspect this now will only get uglier. Instead of one fight at the federal level over abortion, there is now going to be 50 fights, in every state.\nLulu, you raise a good point that really wild and probably chaotic things are about to happen.\nAt least some of the justices on the court, like we heard from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for instance, during the Dobbs arguments, suggest that it is time for the Court to wash its hands of this issue, return it to the states and sort of be neutral. And it suggests that we will be, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, ending an era. And in some ways we are.\nBut I think it shouldn't be lost that we are really entering a whole new chaotic era. Like you said, we have now 50 individual state options for fighting this battle. We know that about half of those states are going to ban all or most abortions very soon, if not already.\nWe know that a growing number of women are going to be pregnant and desperate. We know that they will turn to various means to end those pregnancies. It might be pills; it might be physical trauma, which is still alarmingly common. We know that some women will be prosecuted because that already happens. And we know that some women will die. Those things we know are going to happen. I just want to say that there\u2019s also a lot we don't know, and I think it's important to sort of be humble about that. We don't know how the public is going to react to this. I think we're really in uncharted waters in terms of an election year.\nAll of the various traumas that we have experienced as a society recently, I think people are quite exhausted. So I think it's anybody's guess sort of how the public, how voters, how activists and the movements react to this, not to mention individual politicians. Then I think also, I would expect that we see some states sort of really, really push the boundaries, especially when it comes to going after individual women, which has always been historically something that the pro-life movement liked to mostly stay away from.\nI suspect we see more of that. I suspect that we see some of them pull back a bit if voters don't find that palatable.\nMichelle, one thing that is clear is that those who supported abortion access lost the fight. This decision is the result of decades of work on the right to get justices seated who would deliver the end of Roe. Why do you think that failure happened?\nPartly it happened because of the anti-democratic nature of our institutions, or the counter-majoritarian nature of our institutions.\nAnd there's a subtlety here because on the one hand, Roe v. Wade was itself a decision that was meant to protect minority rights \u2013 the rights of women in states where there is popular support for banning abortions. At the same time, there is broad popular support for Roe as it stood and the only reason that it has now been overturned is because we had presidents who lost the popular vote and nonetheless were able to appoint Supreme Court justices.\nAnd so Democrats have won popular majorities in I believe seven out of the last eight elections and that hasn't been enough to give them control of the Supreme Court.\nAnd so we see the kind of counter-majoritarian vice tightening around American institutions where the majority will have less and less ability to exercise its prerogatives.\nAt the same time, there's a lot that the pro-choice movement can learn from the grassroots organizing of the anti-abortion movement: its relentless focus on local politics; its march through the institutions; its ability to capture state legislatures. I think that the pro-choice movement, and maybe liberals more generally, were too reliant on what was a kind of exceptional situation. We had this brief period where you had the Supreme Court as a kind of protector of last resort of liberalism and civil rights, and haven't done the grassroots work that is needed to create an institutional base for, for these rights. And it's a really long road back. I wish I felt more hope that we will make it there.\nLeah, acknowledging the failure on the opposite side of this, where do you see the push going next in terms of your side of the debate. What would you like to see happen?\nWell, it's obviously, it's a 50 state fight, and I think it's really incumbent on us to make the case not just that abortion should be illegal, but it should be unthinkable. Both because of the monstrous injustice of taking the most vulnerable members of our society, saying we have no room for them and no room for the people whom they depend on, is something that we can't sustain.\nI want it to be like other campaigns for justice, where we win more and more hearts to the idea that this is a barbarity we can and must leave behind.\nAnd I think that comes paired with material support for people who are vulnerable and just a real acknowledgement that dependency is the human condition. No one stands alone. No one is free of obligations to others. What we deserve, what our duties create, is a right to be supported in our duties.\nAnd we've fallen short of that for much longer than Roe\u2019s been in effect, and that fight's going to keep going on across the country.\nI\u2019d like to end with what this moment has left you feeling from your own personal perspectives.\nI remember when I was pregnant a few years ago and I showed all my coworkers the picture on The Bump app of my baby at eight weeks. And everyone was surprised by what a baby looked like then. And it wasn't as pro-life outreach \u2013 it was because I was so excited about the baby, and everyone responded to my baby as a baby.\nAnd two weeks after that, I found out that our baby Ariel had died. And there was such a gap between how my coworkers responded in seeing my child and how my doctor responded the second they knew my baby was dead, in terms of just talking about the pregnancy.\nAnd I want a world where we can love babies and women and fathers more. And I think people have a natural heart for that, and they need more permission for hope.\nI am still processing this moment, I think, it has been looming for so long. But I will say that there is a real physicality to it, that's quite striking. I noticed it when the draft opinion leaked in May and I heard lots of friends and other people I know who follow these things respond similarly \u2013 that there is just a visceral, physical feeling that I won't pretend to be able to unpack exactly what it means in this moment, but it's profound. I am feeling it in my bones.\nI agree with Lauren and that's what I'm hearing from many of my friends.\nHonestly, I just feel \u2013 and hopefully this feeling won\u2019t last \u2013 but I feel a real sense of hopelessness not just about the declining prospects for women's equality, but just where this country is going. We're hurtling into a reactionary future in which none of the guarantees of liberty can be taken for granted. It is so frightening to me. And again, I feel such a sense of shame over the country that my children are going to inherit. It is really difficult for me to put it into words.\nMichelle, are you going to talk to them about this decision?\nI'm not sure. My kids are seven and nine and I have tried to shield them a little bit from the general bleakness.\nSometimes my son will ask me, what do you think the world is gonna be like when I grow up? And I try to redirect the conversation because it's difficult for me to answer.\nI usually say things like, what do you want it to be like? What should we work towards?", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/24/opinion/roundtable-roe-wade-abortion-dobbs.html", "tags": [{"label": "abortion", "score": "0.92257"}, {"label": "decisions and verdicts", "score": "0.76847"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.13063"}, {"label": "suits and litigation", "score": "0.11053"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.03320"}, {"label": "law and legislation", "score": "0.03294"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.03094"}, {"label": "courts", "score": "0.01580"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.01488"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.01345"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01268"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01257"}, {"label": "suits and claims against government", "score": "0.01050"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00989"}, {"label": "women", "score": "0.00980"}, {"label": "appointments and executive changes", "score": "0.00969"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.00851"}, {"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.00739"}, {"label": "election issues", "score": "0.00697"}, {"label": "suspensions, dismissals and resignations", "score": "0.00618"}, {"label": "freedom of speech and expression", "score": "0.00532"}, {"label": "roe v wade (supreme court decision)", "score": "0.00531"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.00489"}, {"label": "judges", "score": "0.00450"}, {"label": "homosexuality", "score": "0.00435"}, {"label": "united states armament and defense", "score": "0.00414"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00414"}, {"label": "discrimination", "score": "0.00385"}, {"label": "international relations", "score": "0.00357"}, {"label": "speech", "score": "0.00355"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["America", "America", "The United States", "America", "America", "America", "America", "America", "America"], "ORG": ["the Supreme Court", "Times Opinion", "Times Opinion", "Court", "the Supreme Court", "Supreme Court", "Buck v.

future outbreaks. Sign up for The Next Pandemic newsletter.\nSign up for The Next Pandemic newsletter.\nIt\u2019s been three years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, and yet many aspects of how to best respond to a novel virus remain unsettled or fiercely debated.\nThe next currently unknown virus that could cause a pandemic \u2014 what the World Health Organization calls \u201cDisease X\u201d \u2014 may be different from Covid, requiring a different set of tools and a different level of response. As Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, outlines in a guest essay, public health leaders sometimes participate in simulations where they are asked to make decisions based on limited information about Disease X, as they would at the beginning of any pandemic.\nWe asked a group of experts to take part in a scaled-down Disease X simulation to show readers the diversity in views on how to best respond to pandemic threats \u2014 quickly, with little detail, as they would likely have to in a real-world situation. We gave the experts a few parameters, and asked them to briefly address specific questions they may be asked by local leaders if such a virus were to emerge and spread in their communities.\nAs you\u2019ll see, not everyone agrees. We hope to show that experts with policy-making experience and similar goals can come to different conclusions and advise different strategies.\nParameters: A respiratory virus starts spreading tomorrow in the United States. It appears more transmissible and more deadly than SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and it is equally risky for children and adults, based on the rapid spread and number of deaths in another country. There's no available vaccine, though one is under investigation. There are only 10 reported cases in the United States, but five are in the jurisdiction you are advising. This is all the information available.\nShould schools close?\nYes, but only briefly. Prolonged school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic caused substantial harms that will likely be felt for decades.\nDr. Jay Varma, former Covid-19 adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York\nWhy, then, would anyone argue in favor of closure? In this scenario, I believe jurisdictions should close in-person school and child care for a brief, well-defined period to strengthen respiratory virus protection measures and accommodate students who choose remote learning and employees who are most vulnerable.\nWith a new, potentially lethal respiratory virus circulating, school closures have two theoretical benefits: reduce illness in children and adults present in schools, and reduce community spread. The harms include impaired education and social and emotional development; physical and mental health issues; and loss of economic activity for parents.\nDuring a brief closure for this new pandemic, states should use the billions of unspent Covid-19 funds and recent Covid-19 systems and contracts to immediately improve indoor air ventilation and disinfection, enlist families to build do-it-yourself air purifiers, supply N95 or KN95 masks in all sizes, contract with local health organizations to provide on-site testing services, and develop alternative staffing and remote learning plans for personnel and children who decline to come to school.\nThis latter point is critical: Many staff members and parents fear for their and their children\u2019s safety during epidemics, and jurisdictions must accommodate their needs, which may require suspending in-person school. But policymakers should publicly commit to reopening no later than four weeks after closure. For those localities that choose not to close, federal officials should make high-quality masks available through a mail-order system and fund remote learning options that meet the home-schooling requirements in multiple states.\nNo, at least not yet. The decision to close schools must be based on the best current understanding of risks and benefits.\nDr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nPre-Covid modeling of school closures in an influenza pandemic indicated that benefits might only be minimal and the harms substantial.\nExperience during Covid makes the harms of school closures even more apparent. Children fell far behind in learning, creating a gap that will reverberate for years, as well as in their social and emotional development. Children lost opportunities for healthy nutrition, physical activity, social support and more. Parents and caregivers were less able to work efficiently. And these costs fell disproportionately on those least able to afford it \u2013 families living in or near poverty or who are otherwise disconnected or disenfranchised.\nFor all these costs, the benefits of closing schools may be minimal. Masking, ventilation, protocols to keep ill children home and other measures minimize spread in schools. Because children often congregate in less-controlled environments when not in school (social events, contact sports, other indoor environments), the reduction in virus transmission may be relatively small.\nIt might become necessary to temporarily close schools in the event of widespread closures, or if schools have difficulty operating safely due to illness among a large proportion of staff, or if a school is caring for medically frail children or, in a last resort, because the virus is spreading widely and with high severity in schools. But the bar to close schools needs to be high \u2013 much higher than was used during Covid. If schools are closed, there should be frequent reassessments with the goal of reopening as soon as possible.\nShould there be a mask mandate?\nYes, it will help. The virus is most likely already spreading undetected in our community.\nDr. Nicole Lurie, former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nWith the virus spreading rapidly in another country, and with five cases found in our area, we can be confident it\u2019s here. The spread will probably now be rapid and exponential, and soon it will be a major killer.\nOur first job is to save lives and slow the spread, and my advice to a city official is that a temporary mask mandate will help with that until we know more about this virus and a vaccine or other therapy becomes available. The sooner we act, the better are our chances to avert needless deaths, prevent the health care system from crashing and limit economic damage.\nThe simple truth is that high-quality masks are effective in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses. During the early days of the Covid pandemic, countries that quickly put mask mandates in place had far fewer cases and deaths than those that did not. Studies also show that communities with mask mandates saw fewer infections than those without them.\nWhy a mandate? Because getting a virus under control is much harder unless everyone wears one. Wearing a mask might feel a little uncomfortable, but it's far better than losing a loved one.\nA mandate is more likely to be accepted if city officials already have community trust. This requires listening, explaining and maintaining honest, clear communication with the public and community leaders, and aggressively combating disinformation. Public trust is key to reducing infection and death. Doing the right thing is not always easy, but it will save lives.\nNo, this isn\u2019t the time. There are other effective interventions to focus on first.\nDr. Anders Tegnell, the former state epidemiologist in Sweden\nThis is most likely not the time to mandate masks, as there are other options. People should avoid crowded indoor spaces and stay home if they are feeling sick. People should work from home as much as possible. Big events should be canceled, and the number of diners allowed in restaurants should be restricted. These are all interventions that are likely to lower the spread of disease.\nContact tracing needs to start now, and testing should be made available when it can be. In health care settings, masks should be used. Masks and other hygiene measures should be especially emphasized in elderly care.\nStudying this disease and learning more about it and what interventions might be most effective should begin right away. That way all measures can be tailored to the situation at hand.\nSweden did not issue a mask mandate during the Covid pandemic, though masks were encouraged at various points. The few high-quality studies done on mask wearing in public show, in my view and that of other researchers, a limited effect. It should not be considered the first or most important intervention to control spread. However, careful monitoring is essential to tailor interventions to the new threat.\nShould there be an international travel ban?\nYes, if done properly. Travel bans can be an effective public health tool.\nDr. Jerome Adams, the 20th U.S. surgeon general\nTravel restrictions have been used throughout history to slow infectious disease spread. They can\u2019t keep diseases out of a region indefinitely, but they can buy time while the authorities learn more about a disease and its spread, and deploy additional surveillance, containment and treatment measures.\nIf you know, for instance, that there are higher levels of a virus detected (via testing or appearance of symptoms) in one place versus another, having a travel restriction can decelerate the inevitable diffusion of disease. Such delays can save resources, and lives. We saw this in 2020 when early travel restrictions helped prevent health institutions in the United States from being overwhelmed to the extent of those in countries like Italy.\nHowever, it is a fallacy to believe travel restrictions alone will keep us safe in a world of global mobility and difficult-to-detect viruses, particularly ones that spread asymptomatically. Further, travel bans done haphazardly can unfairly discriminate and impose heavy economic costs.\nTo be most effective, travel restrictions should be appropriately timed and targeted, and must be coupled with additional measures. We met some of those criteria with Covid-19 but failed on too many others. Just as is the case with other pandemic response tools, our past suboptimal use doesn\u2019t mean the tool itself was ineffective, or that we shouldn\u2019t consider a pause on travel when future threats arise. Our goal should be to make better and smarter use of travel restrictions, not to do away with them altogether.\nNo, the impact will be low. Travel bans have rarely stopped the spread of new pathogens.\nDr. Jennifer B. Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health\nAt best, they may temporarily slow the arrival of pathogens, but their impact depends on what comes next.\nIn 2020, a handful of countries, like New Zealand, used strict travel restrictions to buy time to bolster their national testing and contract tracing capacities against Covid. But too often travel restrictions replace a full domestic response.\nTo stop or meaningfully slow the spread of a pathogen, travel bans must be imposed early, with good knowledge of where a pathogen is spreading. But national surveillance capabilities tend to show us cases only in the countries looking hardest for infection. When the United States restricted travel from China at the end of February 2020, the coronavirus had probably already been spreading stateside for weeks. New York\u2019s deadly first wave of cases was later linked to travel from Europe. Restrictions also didn\u2019t prevent a large Omicron wave in the United States.\nInstead, travel bans can create a chilling effect on other countries\u2019 willingness to diagnose and report cases. It also hampered the movement of critical supplies to the same laboratories upon which the world depended for important information about the virus.\nInstead of stopping travel, we should focus on making travel safer. Once we have a diagnostic test, we should set up temporary testing at airports. We should also expand our surveillance to include wastewater from planes to track pathogens and genetic variants.\nIf a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, should it be mandated?\nPossibly, even though they\u2019re unpopular. Mandates can be helpful in a pandemic.\nWendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern\nLaws that require individuals to be vaccinated to work or go to school do limit individual autonomy and clash with some religious beliefs. They can also deepen distrust of public health. Still, for almost 200 years, mandates have proven to be an effective public health tool that should be considered during a pandemic.\nThe reasons for mandates are simple. People who forgo vaccination may be more likely to infect others, including those who cannot be vaccinated or for whom vaccines will not work due to immune impairments. During an outbreak, vaccine rejection can also strain the health care system.\nIn an ideal world, governments could counter the problem of low vaccination rates by increasing public awareness of the benefits and safety of vaccines and ensuring that vaccines are easily accessible. Unfortunately, such efforts often fall short, especially in the face of zealous vaccination opponents, rampant misinformation, and a highly polarized environment.\nWell-devised mandates can sometimes help overcome such resistance, nudging those who are not adamantly opposed to vaccines to get vaccinated. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that mandates for schoolchildren and health care workers improve their vaccination rates.\nIn all cases, health officials should weigh the benefits and risks of mandates, including the risk of a backlash. Officials must also ensure that the evidence strongly demonstrates the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy, that the reasons for a mandate are well explained, and that the mandate is enforced equitably. Everyone must also have the economic and social means for complying. Whether those criteria are met for any given vaccine mandate can be debated. What is certain is that a pandemic is not the time to take mandates off the table.\nNot without exemptions. Mandates work, but they come with side effects.\nDr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health\nThe effectiveness of vaccine mandates depends on how they are carried out and on exemptions allowed from these requirements.\nOver the last couple of decades, my colleagues and I have conducted studies to answer the question: What mandates are optimal to achieve high vaccination rates while ensuring vaccine requirements garner broad support? Much of our data comes from school-based mandates, but our analysis is relevant to other types of vaccine mandates as well.\nOur findings suggest that vaccine mandates work, and that mandates that are too easy to opt out of are less effective. However, if there are no exemptions, or if it is too hard to get one, people find ways to avoid vaccine requirements. In the case of school-based mandates, many people may home-school their children or simply ignore vaccine mandates in schools that are lax about enforcing them.\nA middle-of-the-road approach to vaccine mandates is most effective and sustainable. First, medical as well as religious or philosophical exemptions should be allowed. Physician counseling can be required for those who file for exemptions \u2013 this approach was effective in Washington State for reducing childhood vaccine refusal. Experience from U.S. colleges during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that more frequent testing for the unvaccinated is also associated with high vaccination rates without significant backlash from students (or their parents).", "article": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/12/opinion/pandemic-disease-x-simulation.html", "tags": [{"label": "diseases and conditions", "score": "0.70111"}, {"label": "medicine and health", "score": "0.38708"}, {"label": "books and literature", "score": "0.08814"}, {"label": "viruses", "score": "0.07633"}, {"label": "epidemics", "score": "0.06328"}, {"label": "computers and the internet", "score": "0.02688"}, {"label": "education and schools", "score": "0.02028"}, {"label": "biological and chemical warfare", "score": "0.01284"}, {"label": "research", "score": "0.01162"}, {"label": "terrorism", "score": "0.01057"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.01055"}, {"label": "finances", "score": "0.01013"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.00997"}, {"label": "acquired immune deficiency syndrome", "score": "0.00982"}, {"label": "third world and developing countries", "score": "0.00885"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.00820"}, {"label": "tests and testing", "score": "0.00740"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.00561"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00535"}, {"label": "children and youth", "score": "0.00403"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.00397"}, {"label": "photography", "score": "0.00390"}, {"label": "world trade center (nyc)", "score": "0.00384"}, {"label": "conventions and conferences", "score": "0.00362"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00358"}, {"label": "airlines and airplanes", "score": "0.00357"}, {"label": "computer security", "score": "0.00351"}, {"label": "media", "score": "0.00335"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00317"}, {"label": "news and news media", "score": "0.00304"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["the United States", "the United States", "New York", "Sweden", "Sweden", "U.S.", "the United States", "Italy", "New Zealand", "the United States", "China", "New York\u2019s", "the United States", "Washington State", "U.S."], "ORG": ["the World Health Organization", "the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security", "the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nPre-Covid", "the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health", "Omicron", "the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern\nLaws", "the Yale Institute for Global Health"], "PERSON": ["Tom Inglesby", "Jay Varma", "Bill de Blasio", "Tom Frieden", "Nicole Lurie", "Anders Tegnell", "Jerome Adams", "Jennifer B.

His aviator glasses, gleaming white teeth and peroxide hair gave him the appearance of a Las Vegas timeshare salesman; instead, he was flogging a story to other famous men like Rickie Lambert, the former Liverpool and England forward, who had advertised this rally in advance without mentioning its special guest.\nAdvertisement\nOn the opposite side of the road was another group, making a stand against fascism. For a good half-hour, two men holding megaphones used the busy thoroughfare as a barrier between ideologies as cars went past and bemused commuters tried to get home.\nWhile the anti-fascists screamed about Nazis and the real problems Liverpool\u2019s residents should campaign against, the \u201cfreedom\u201d movement stood behind yellow placards that advised readers to \u201cquestion everything\u201d and to \u201close the denial\u201d. There was also another warning: \u201c15-minute neighbourhoods will be your prison.\u201d\nThat, ultimately, was what Lambert was here for: to raise awareness of the supposed threat of Liverpool becoming a \u201c15-minute city\u201d, where the local government stands accused of planning to essentially segregate districts in the name of climate change.\nSky emerged as an online agitator at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic by railing against restrictions at a series of \u201cfreedom rallies\u201d. To his followers, he is a precious purveyor of truth in a world of sinister forces trying to exercise control; to many more, he is a dangerous conspiracy theorist.\nThere was, however, no denying he was the star attraction on Wednesday. After another \u201cfreedom\u201d spokesman with the megaphone denied the event\u2019s links to the far right \u2014 \u201cThis has nothing to do with racism,\u201d he claimed \u2014 Sky and his followers ambled towards the space in front of the crown court. Then, after the rally\u2019s organiser described those mainly middle-class-looking older women and students handing out socialist newsletters on the other side of the street as \u201csatanic\u201d communists trying to \u201csteal our souls\u201d, Sky was invited to talk.\n\u201cHello Liverpool,\u201d he shouted into the mic, only for his voice to disappear in a violent gust blowing in from the Irish Sea.\nSky announced that he was on a tour to change the world courtesy of speeches like this one, which included unsubstantiated claims about the return of Covid-19, the weaponising of climate change by governments in an attempt to control freedoms, and a hidden LGBT agenda that the audience needed to be aware of because according to the Bible, \u201cpride\u201d was one of the seven deadly sins.\nAdvertisement\nLambert, who did not speak despite his role in promoting the event, stood by, taking it all in. Most people did, but for one Liverpudlian in a vest, who piped up from the back of the crowd: \u201cWhy the f*** are we listening to some American talk about our city?\u201d\nIt was at that point that someone informed him that Sky, whose surname is really Saccoccia, was in fact from Canada.\nIn his book, Red Pill Blue Pill, David Newert describes a conspiracy theory as \u201ca hypothetical explanation of historical or ongoing new events comprised of secret plots, usually of a nefarious nature, whose existence may or may not be factual\u201d.\nIn recent years, Newert adds that it has also become a \u201ckind of dismissive epithet\u201d. The majority of people, he explains, do not have the time for conspiracist beliefs and, therefore, it is easier to banish those who do as \u201ccartoonish scam peddlers\u201d.\nA psychologist based in Merseyside, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of his working contracts, makes comparisons between conspiracy theorists and his experiences in the drug services when survivors discover salvation, prompting them to want to impart their knowledge to others by working in recovery.\n\u201cWhen conspiracy theorists discover something, they never keep it to themselves,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThey have to pass it on to someone else. Now they know their place in the world, they see themselves as crusaders.\u201d\nConspiracy theories can take root in every sector of society and yet there are compelling reasons why sportspeople \u2014 including footballers \u2014 could be particularly susceptible.\nLambert has used his social media platforms to perpetrate a variety of outlandish theories, including calling for doctors and nurses who vaccinated children against Covid-19 to be arrested, sharing posts that erroneously claim vaccine shots contain \u2018cancer virus\u2019, and saying that anyone who is \u201cin on the globalist plan, the new world order, needs to be brought down\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nYet he is by no means the only high-profile example. Matt Le Tissier, one of his predecessors in a Southampton and England shirt, has used social media to augment arguments among conspiracy theorists that include the denial of the war in Ukraine and actors being used to fake what is happening in front of Western cameras.\nLe Tissier claims he has been pushed to the fringes by mainstream media companies because of his views. Support has come from Lambert but also from other ex-footballers, such as David Cotterill, the former Swansea City and Wales midfielder, who has used his Instagram account to make wild accusations over the existence of a network of celebrity paedophiles, climate change, Covid restrictions and that a Texas school shooting was a \u2018false flag\u2019 event.\nAnother former Liverpool player, Dejan Lovren, appeared to endorse the conspiracy theory that the Covid-19 pandemic was devised as a ploy to force vaccinations on the world\u2019s population. In 2020, he responded to a social media post thanking health workers by Bill Gates, the billionaire who helped fund vaccine research, by saying: \u201cGame over Bill. People are not blind.\u201d He has repeatedly promoted links to talks by David Icke, the former Coventry goalkeeper, who has long held a belief that the British Royal Family are a group of shape-shifting lizards.\nOn a similar theme, the former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas revealed in 2018 that he did not believe the Moon landings were real.\nThe key word in any cognitive reaction to conspiracy theories, according to the psychologist, is \u2018threat\u2019. They explain the brain like this: the threat part of the brain is the most potent, telling the drive system to do something about it. But the drive system is also the part of the brain that deals with reward, which makes people feel like they are eliminating a threat. This, therefore, makes people feel like they are achieving something. When that happens, it releases chemicals like serotonin and dopamine, making them feel better.\n\u201cIt gives people a purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is, it becomes cyclical. The threat system says, \u2018You\u2019ve done something about it this time \u2014 what about next time? You feel good now but there\u2019s another threat around the corner.\u2019 This means the brain jumps back into drive.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a million miles away from the life of a Premier League football player, who has to push themselves to avoid being dropped or heckled by 60,000 spectators who revel in telling you that you\u2019re crap at your job. In a sporting life, that\u2019s the threat. You\u2019ve done well in one game, but there\u2019s always another to follow.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSportspeople are susceptible to this world because of how carefully they need to manage their bodies in order to perform.\n\u201cClean eating became a fad 10 years ago or so,\u201d the psychologist says when asked to explain what can happen when sportspeople embrace alternative thinking. \u201cThat quickly becomes, \u2018Don\u2019t trust the professionals \u2014 take charge of what you put into your body.\u2019 This then becomes, \u2018Don\u2019t trust the professionals \u2014 they are in the pockets of \u2018big pharma\u2019\u2019. You throw in a pandemic in the middle of all this, along with various high-profile political scandals, and suddenly it manifests into not trusting anyone, claims about who controls the planet, and extreme views such as antisemitism.\u201d\nThese are big jumps, but look at the leap Le Tissier has made in a relatively short space of time, from small city champion and legendary Southampton No 7 to a war-denier in Ukraine, who in July, without providing evidence, suggested on Twitter a \u201ccommunist takeover is slyly being implemented\u201d.\nThe psychologist suggests retired footballers can find life difficult without the routine of training and matches. This can lead to them seeking a lost dressing room culture that can be found initially in a chat room or a forum.\n\u201cGiven golf courses were closed during the pandemic and there was nothing else to do, there was a sanctuary of sorts on the internet, where people seeking explanations for questions that had no answers seemed to find them. Such groups offer the illusion of certainty and safeness.\u201d\nThe problem, as Newert points out, is that real conspiracies do exist and have done through most of civilised history.\nIn Liverpool, particularly, you only need to remind people of the 1980s, when \u201cmanaged decline\u201d was suspected as a strategy of the United Kingdom\u2019s Conservative government, before official papers were released under the 30-year rule in 2011 revealing that Chancellor Geoffrey Howe had, at the very least, proposed the policy to then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.\nAdvertisement\nMany people who lived in the city through this period would agree that there is enough evidence to believe the policy was, in fact, carried out. The decade finished with Hillsborough, the worst football disaster in British history, when the authorities aligned to blame fans. It would take more than a quarter of a century for a cover-up to be exposed in a courtroom and only in the past few years have some police forces started paying out damages to victims.\nIn some parts of Liverpool, it is still believed that the heroin epidemic of the same era was another strategy, aimed at doping the city up as the rot set in \u2014 preventing people in the haze from standing their ground.\nOnly a few hundred at most turned up outside Liverpool\u2019s town hall on Wednesday, but the psychologist believes the city is fertile ground for conspiracists because of its history and a wariness towards authority.\nThough it has not manifested into demonstrations, the current Conservative government\u2019s decision to send in commissioners to run an area that hasn\u2019t had a Tory councillor since 1997 has heightened suspicion amongst those with long memories.\nThis month, Icke hosted a talk in Liverpool\u2019s Greenbank Conference Centre and he wouldn\u2019t have organised that if he didn\u2019t think at least some people from the surrounding area would turn up.\nSuper conspiracies, the psychologist thinks, are intoxicating because they have no answers, which helps maintain an interest over a long period of time.\n\u201cThe awakening always feels just around the corner; that Scooby Doo moment, where the villain\u2019s sack is removed from his head,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst, there was 5G to consider. Then there were lockdowns and masks. Now there are 15-minute cities. It\u2019s a never-ending threat and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so difficult to escape from.\u201d\nLambert, whose football career ended in 2017 following 241 goals in 701 games for nine clubs across all levels of professional football in England, perhaps stands as testament to that.\nAdvertisement\nOn September 11, the 41-year-old used his Twitter page to start promoting the rally with a poster that could easily have been an advert for a ghost tour, where the town hall faded into the background of a ghoulish blue light.\n\u201cPeople of Liverpool, start researching 15 minute city\u2019s (sic),\u201d Lambert wrote, \u201cbecause they are coming our way very shortly if we allow it.\u201d\nThen, in capital letters, he added: \u201cWE DO NOT CONSENT!!\u201d\nA video from a garden followed three days later, was aimed at \u201cyou Scousers\u201d.\nAccording to Lambert, Liverpool\u2019s council was planning on \u201cdividing\u201d the city into 13 zones in an attempt to create greener and safer spaces for \u201cus, the people\u201d.\n\u201cIt is not, it is not,\u201d Lambert insisted. \u201cIt is a controlled tactic being implemented across this country as we speak. These are initial movements for 15-minute cities, all under the guise of climate change.\u201d\nLiverpool would be under the surveillance of cameras and, eventually, permanent barriers, according to Lambert. \u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cUs, the people, will not stand for this control tactic.\u201d\nWhile Lambert did not provide evidence for these claims, the city council is adamant that such plans have never been discussed at any committee meeting and it does not form a part of its planning or policy.\nThe 15-minute city, an urban design concept which could be perceived as a fairly mundane strategy that has been moderately successful in other parts of the world for more than a decade, aims to provide everything that a resident supposedly needs within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.\nSince the start of 2023, however, it has been targeted by conspiracy theorists, who believe it to be a part of a malign international plot to control people\u2019s movement in the name of climate change. According to the protestors standing beside Sky, new cameras in bus lanes were evidence that this process had started in Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nNot every person\u2019s life can be viewed through their social media output, but Lambert\u2019s might be revealing in terms of what it does not include over the first three years.\nHis Instagram page has been active since 2017 and until 2020, nearly all of his posts related to his family and football. If he was interested in politics, medicine, or social freedoms, he did not show it.\nThe nature of those posts began to change six months into the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically when Rishi Sunak told musicians they should retrain and find new jobs.\nLambert, like a lot of people, pushed back at this radical suggestion by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has since become the British prime minister.\nBy March 2021, he was posting about lockdowns, writing: \u201cNo new variant or blaming the unvaccinated!! NO MORE!!!\u201d\nLambert only joined Twitter in June 2023, attracting 10,000 followers since. His bio suggests he is \u201cfighting for my children\u2019s future\u201d, as an ex-footballer-turned-coach, though he does not mention he is employed by Wigan Athletic. It includes the hashtag #greatawakening.\nIn his first video post, he described himself as a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d before having a stab at explaining what he thought this phenomenon was.\n\u201cNo one has ever told us what the great awakening is,\u201d Lambert admitted.\nA month later, he released another, more succinct video, where he \u201cwithdrew his consent to be governed by any corrupt, compromised, belligerent parliament of government\u201d.\n\u201cI will not comply,\u201d he added.\nI had asked Lambert for an interview in July, to speak about his views, challenge them, and to see where they were rooted. Initially, he agreed, but the night before we were due to meet, he cancelled without any initial indication he wanted to reschedule. After being pressed on another date and promising to come back with a suggestion, he did not.\nAdvertisement\nIt became apparent on his Instagram page that two days before our original interview, he had attended a gathering with at least four other people, including Andrew Bridgen, the Member of Parliament who, earlier this year, was expelled from the Conservative Party for comparing Covid-19 vaccines to the Holocaust. He had also been found to have breached lobbying rules.\nAt the start of September, Hope Not Hate, the largest anti-fascist organisation in the United Kingdom, distributed a picture of Bridgen in Copenhagen with Tommy Robinson, arguably the most notorious far-right activist in the United Kingdom.\nThe organisers of the rally Lambert promoted and attended in Liverpool were the British Lions, a group which was spawned out of the Covid conspiracy \u201cfreedom\u201d movement.\nDespite using ancient law and sovereign language, Hope Not Hate says the organisation is not explicitly far-right, but says that some of its members have been seen at other far-right events.\nA leaflet handed out by the British Lions on Wednesday outlined, rather chaotically, all of the things they are challenging the government on. Some were rooted in reality, such as the attempt to criminalise rights to protest; others were unsubstantiated claims apparently designed to offer the impression of a super conspiracy.\nSo many of the origin stories for these groups and beliefs can be traced back to the pandemic, which Joe Mulhall, from Hope Not Hate, describes as an \u201cunprecedented opportunity for engagement with the conspiracy world\u201d.\nMulhall says conspiracists will ignore any differences when they meet believers of their secretive world. \u201cThe nuances seem tiny when they feel like they are conquering an external force. The enormity of the perceived threat means they will put aside political distinctions that traditionally might be a problem.\u201d\nNine summers ago, I watched Lambert cry tears of joy as he completed his dream move. He was at Melwood, Liverpool\u2019s old training ground, having just signed for the club.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I spoke to him briefly in July, he described it as the best moment of his life. I remember being delighted for him, as so many Liverpool supporters were. His story until this point had been one of crushing rejection and extraordinary revival, heaving himself from the floor of his release from the club he loved as a teenager to working his way back a couple of decades later. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this has happened,\u201d he told me.\nOn much colder reflection, his path might offer clues as to why he thinks the way he does now. Lambert was born in Kirkby, an overspill town seven miles inland from Liverpool\u2019s city centre, living in a maisonette opposite the old Kirkby Stadium, which for junior teams in the area was the equivalent of Wembley. With a notoriously hard shot, he was spotted by Liverpool scouts aged 10 and he spent five years in the junior ranks, rejecting opportunities to join Everton and Manchester United.\nIt was not a shock to him when he was told by Steve Heighway, Liverpool\u2019s academy director, that he was being released because of his lack of pace. Over the next few years, he had to adapt his game and this led to him playing in a variety of positions. He joined Blackpool as a right-back, but by the last year of his apprenticeship, he was a central midfielder. Two of those years had been under Nigel Worthington, but when Steve McMahon, the former Liverpool midfielder, took over, his fortunes changed. McMahon had been his father\u2019s hero, but within six months of his appointment as manager, Lambert was allowed to leave the club \u2014 unable to even get a game for the reserves. McMahon had seen ability but did not think Lambert\u2019s body would allow him to regularly play for 90 minutes.\nOn trial at Macclesfield Town, he was not being paid and this led to him getting a job at a beetroot factory. Aged 19, he was contemplating a career in the semi-professional ranks because he did not have a car and could not even afford the cost of the travel expenses to make it to training. Yet six months later, he was sold to Stockport County for what remains a club record fee of \u00a3300,000.\nLambert believes he was entitled to earn 10 per cent of that fee, but when he tried to buy a house, he learned that the money had disappeared into an agent\u2019s account. By the age of 19, it would be understandable if he had trust issues given he might feel let down by the club he loved, his father\u2019s hero, and the person supposedly representing him in this cruel, unforgiving sport.\nAt Stockport, Lambert found it hard to adapt to a deep-lying midfield role. The team was struggling and the fans turned on the players. As the most expensive signing, he bore the brunt and this led to him dropping a division to join League Two Rochdale, where he rediscovered a sense of purpose while playing as a centre-forward. He maintained his scoring habit after moving to Bristol Rovers and when Southampton were relegated into League One, new owners, with new money, enticed him to the south coast. There, the manager Alan Pardew asked him to lift his top up. Looking at his belly, he told him he was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\nDespite scoring the goals that helped Southampton accelerate back up the leagues and making friends with Le Tissier along the way, Lambert says the club wanted to sell him every summer.\nAdvertisement\nHe was desperate to prove them wrong and when he finally made it into the Premier League, aged 30, he had played almost 400 games across each of the divisions in the English football league. Yet in the opening game of that season, at champions Manchester City, he was left on the bench. The decision by manager Nigel Adkins suggested he didn\u2019t truly believe in him.\nListening to Lambert, you begin to realise how lonely football can be. He could only ever really trust himself: his talent and resilience. Regularly, those making decisions about the direction of his career did not. Even after proving himself in the Premier League, he felt as though international recognition with England only came out of respect for his record rather than his ability.\nOn his debut against Scotland, he was in \u201cdreamland\u201d after scoring the winner. He made it into England\u2019s squad for the 2014 World Cup squad but felt like a \u201cmascot\u201d after just three minutes of playing time. The lack of action meant he felt he needed less of a summer holiday as he began his Liverpool career. Despite being given five weeks off, he returned to Melwood after a fortnight, vowing to become the fittest he had ever been.\nIt proved to be a mistake because he needed the break. Aged 32, Lambert had never played a full season extending into a summer tournament before. Back on Merseyside, he felt heavy \u2014 like he didn\u2019t have any energy. On the club\u2019s pre-season tour of the United States, he struggled with the routine of training, playing and travelling.\nLiverpool\u2019s manager, Brendan Rodgers, had told Lambert that he was bringing in Alexis Sanchez to replace the outgoing Luis Suarez. Sanchez, however, never arrived. In the 2014-15 season, Liverpool missed Suarez terribly. In Sanchez\u2019s place, Rodgers bought Mario Balotelli despite vowing not to, and Balotelli\u2019s signing was a failure.\nLambert was under more pressure to deliver. His first Liverpool goal at Crystal Palace coincided with what turned into a bad team performance and a defeat. After just five months at the club, Rodgers wanted to move him on, but Lambert rejected the opportunity to join Palace before he almost went to Aston Villa. He never fulfilled that boyhood dream of scoring for Liverpool at Anfield.\nOut of the starting XI, his fitness got worse. He was less likely to affect a game if his chance did come. Spells at West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City followed, but within six weeks, Lambert was told by Neil Warnock that he wanted him off the wage bill. One of the offers came from Scunthorpe United, but he couldn\u2019t face lowering himself to a level of football which he had tried so hard to get away from.\nAdvertisement\nListening to him on the Straight From The Off podcast in 2021, it seemed as though he was still searching for answers as to why his career unravelled the way it did. Certainly, had he listened to any supposed \u201cexpert\u201d at crucial points in his career, then he may have not even made it to Blackpool.\nAcross the Liverpool fanbase, he has become a figure of fun, but not because his time at the club ended in the way it did. In another podcast this year, he spoke enthusiastically about scientists conducting an experiment where they spent time speaking positively to a glass of water, which allegedly responded by dazzling them with the clarity of their crystals.\nWhen a friend saw that clip, he messaged me straight away, asking: \u201cWhat next, Rickie Lambert taking mortgage advice from a can of Fanta?\u201d\n(Top photo: Getty Images; design: Eamonn Dalton)", "article": "https://theathletic.com/4885754/2023/09/22/rickie-lambert-football-conspiracy-theories/", "tags": [{"label": "demonstrations and riots", "score": "0.26677"}, {"label": "elections", "score": "0.10696"}, {"label": "politics and government", "score": "0.05363"}, {"label": "advertising and marketing", "score": "0.04986"}, {"label": "reviews", "score": "0.02094"}, {"label": "travel and vacations", "score": "0.01996"}, {"label": "advertising", "score": "0.01501"}, {"label": "no index terms from nytimes", "score": "0.01346"}, {"label": "jews", "score": "0.01225"}, {"label": "religion and churches", "score": "0.01213"}, {"label": "labor", "score": "0.01080"}, {"label": "biographical information", "score": "0.01034"}, {"label": "presidential elections (us)", "score": "0.00956"}, {"label": "terms not available", "score": "0.00891"}, {"label": "no index terms", "score": "0.00825"}, {"label": "minorities (us)", "score": "0.00760"}, {"label": "music", "score": "0.00733"}, {"label": "television", "score": "0.00703"}, {"label": "crime and criminals", "score": "0.00686"}, {"label": "presidents and presidency (us)", "score": "0.00654"}, {"label": "hair", "score": "0.00643"}, {"label": "discrimination", "score": "0.00638"}, {"label": "endorsements", "score": "0.00599"}, {"label": "animals", "score": "0.00595"}, {"label": "environment", "score": "0.00574"}, {"label": "economic conditions and trends", "score": "0.00562"}, {"label": "armament, defense and military forces", "score": "0.00543"}, {"label": "diseases and conditions", "score": "0.00522"}, {"label": "blacks (in us)", "score": "0.00521"}, {"label": "united states politics and government", "score": "0.00509"}], "NER": {"GPE": ["Liverpool", "Las Vegas", "Liverpool", "England", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpudlian", "Canada", "Merseyside", "Southampton", "England", "Ukraine", "Swansea City", "Wales", "Texas", "Liverpool", "Spain", "Southampton", "Ukraine", "Liverpool", "the United Kingdom\u2019s", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "England", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "the United Kingdom", "Copenhagen", "the United Kingdom", "Liverpool", "Melwood", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Manchester United", "Liverpool", "Blackpool", "Liverpool", "Stockport County", "Stockport", "Southampton", "Southampton", "Manchester City", "England", "Scotland", "England", "Liverpool", "Melwood", "Merseyside", "the United States", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Liverpool", "Anfield", "Cardiff City", "Scunthorpe United", "Blackpool", "Liverpool"], "ORG": ["Sky", "Sky", "Sky", "Sky", "Lambert", "Instagram", "Coventry", "the British Royal Family", "Premier League", "Hillsborough", "Greenbank Conference Centre", "People of Liverpool", "Lambert", "Lambert", "the city council", "Sky", "Instagram", "Exchequer", "Twitter", "Wigan Athletic", "Instagram", "Parliament", "the Conservative Party", "the British Lions", "the British Lions", "Kirkby", "Wembley", "Everton", "League Two Rochdale", "Bristol Rovers", "League One", "the Premier League", "the Premier League", "Palace", "West Bromwich Albion", "Fanta", "Getty Images"], "PERSON": ["Chris Sky", "Rickie Lambert", "Lambert", "Sky", "Saccoccia", "David Newert", "Newert", "Lambert", "Matt Le Tissier", "Le Tissier", "David Cotterill", "Dejan Lovren", "Bill Gates", "Bill", "David Icke", "Iker Casillas", "Moon", "Newert", "Geoffrey Howe", "Margaret Thatcher", "Icke", "Scooby Doo moment", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Rishi Sunak", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Andrew Bridgen", "Bridgen", "Tommy Robinson", "Lambert", "Joe Mulhall", "Mulhall", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Steve Heighway", "Nigel Worthington", "Steve McMahon", "McMahon", "Lambert", "McMahon", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Alan Pardew", "Le Tissier", "Lambert", "Nigel Adkins", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Brendan Rodgers", "Lambert", "Alexis Sanchez", "Luis Suarez", "Sanchez", "Suarez", "Sanchez", "Rodgers", "Mario Balotelli", "Balotelli", "Lambert", "Rodgers", "Lambert", "Lambert", "Neil Warnock", "Rickie Lambert", "Eamonn Dalton"]}}]
