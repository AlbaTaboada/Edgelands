Sadat!\" tens of thousands of Cairenes chanted at the grinning figure in the open limousine. ''Sadat! The man of peace!'' It was the night of Nov. 21, 1977. President\nAnwar el-Sadat had just returned from his epochal journey to Jerusalem. Egypt's people were giving their frenzied approval to what his trip had achieved - an Egyptian-Israeli thaw that set the\nstage for the peace treaty of 1979.\nWhat made Mr. Sadat into such a catalytic force in Middle Eastern history was a display of courage and flexibility that transformed what had seemed to be an average Arab officer-turned-potentate.\nUnlike so many of his brother Arab leaders, he was willing to ignore past Arab-Israeli hatreds. Unlike them all, he was daring enough to do what had been unthinkable in the anguished world of Arab politics\n- to extend the hand of peace to the Israeli foe. Reversing Egypt's longstanding policy, he proclaimed his willingness to accept Israel's existence as a sovereign state.\nAdmiration and Hatred\nThen, where so many Middle East negotiators had failed, he succeeded, along with Presidents Carter and Reagan and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, in keeping the improbable rapprochement alive.\nIn the process he earned himself, in addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, the admiration of Americans, Israelis and other supporters of a Middle East settlement. But he also drew outpourings of hatred\nfrom Palestinians and other Arabs who felt he was a traitor to their struggles against Israel. And he was unable to quash dissidence in his impoverished, seething homeland.\nHe often said he wanted to bequeath democratic institutions to his people, but in recent weeks he staged a dictatorial crackdown on militant Moslems and Coptic Christians as well as secular political\nopponents. And he claimed imperially - but hollowly, as it turned out - to have put an end to ''lack of discipline in any way or form.''\nThe Treaty\nEleven days before Mr. Sadat made his trip to Jerusalem, he said in Cairo that he was willing to go to ''the ends of the earth,'' and even to the Israeli Parliament, in the cause\nof peace. The Israeli Government made known that he was welcome in Jerusalem, and after complex negotiations he flew there, although a state of war still existed between the two nations.\nHis eyes were moist and his lips taut with suppressed emotion as he arrived, but his Arabic was firm and resonant when, hours later, he told the hushed Israeli Parliament, ''If you want to\nlive with us in this part of the world, in sincerity I tell you that we welcome you among us with all security and safety.''\nPraising Mr. Sadat's initiative, Prime Minister Begin said, ''We, the Jews, know how to appreciate such courage.'' Mr. Sadat's flexibility, he said later, stemmed from his\nsolitary confinement as a political prisoner in cell 54 of Cairo Central Prison in 1947 and 1948. ''My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded place taught me that he who\ncannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality and will never, therefore, make any progress,'' he wrote in his memoirs, ''In Search of Identity,''\nwhich appeared in 1978, eight years after he assumed the Presidency.\nPact Signed at White House\nHis willingness to make such a change led to the treaty that, after many snags, he and Prime Minister Begin signed at the White House on March 26, 1979. Before reaching agreement Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin\nhad drawn-out and sometimes acrimonious negotiations, for which they were the joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.\nThe treaty provided that Israel return to Egypt in phases the entire Sinai Peninsula, which the Israelis seized in the 1967 war. It also envisioned internal autonomy for the Palestinian Arabs of the\nWest Bank of the Jordan River under continued Israeli control. The Egyptian and Israeli Governments were helped and prodded by the Nixon and Carter Administrations, and Henry A. Kissinger, after\nmany meetings with Mr. Sadat, wrote that the Egyptian leader ''possessed that combinat ion of insight and courage which marks a great statesman.'' The former Secretary of State\ncontinued in his book, ''White House Years'': ''He had the boldness to go to a war no one thought he could sustain; the moderation to move to peace immediately afterward;\nand the wisdom to reverse attitudes hardened by decades.''\nUsed Harmony as a Technique\nIn dealings with Israel and the United States, Mr. Sadat strove to create a harmonious mood that would make it difficult for others to disagree with him. His most audacious use of that technique was\nthe Jerusalem visit.\nThat gesture and the treaty with Israel brought him hatred and vituperation from many Arab leaders. There was particular outrage because the treaty did not provide a timetable for full self-determination\nfor the West Bank Palestinians that would lead eventually to an independent Palestinian state.\nSelf-determination was originally Mr. Sadat's minimum demand; when he settled for less, he found himself virtually isolated in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia's leaders, with whom he had achieved\nwarm relations, cut back their aid to the Egyptian armed forces and the economy, which Mr. Sadat had tried to strengthen by encouraging business.\nThe Saudi action made Egypt more dependent than ever on support from the United States, with which Mr. Sadat had also been careful to cultivate bonds of friendship. Under his predecessor, Gamal Abdel\nNasser, Cairo's relations with the Americans, as with the Saudis, were hostile much of the time. Mr. Sadat won moral and political support from Washington as well as large-scale economic and\nmilitary aid, and in 1975 he became the first Egyptian President to make a state visit to the United States. He returned again during the treaty negotiations, and President Carter went to Egypt,\nwhere throngs hailed him and his host.\nTreaty Welcomed by Egyptians\nMany of the 40 million Egyptians, having gone through four painful and expensive wars with Israel, were enthusiastic about the peace treaty. Throngs of well-wishers danced, waved signs and threw rose\npetals in celebration.\nUnder the treaty Israel's withdrawal of its civilian and military forces from Sinai was to be carried out in stages over three years. Two-thirds of the area was to be handed back within nine months\nafter the exchange of formal ratification documents. In return for the Israeli pullback, Mr. Sadat agreed to establish peace. After the nine-month withdrawal was finished, the two Governments were\nto take up ''normal and friendly relations'' in the diplomatic, economic and cultural spheres, among others. The early withdrawals were completed, and the final phase is scheduled\nfor next April.\n''This is certainly one of the happiest moments of my life,'' Mr. Sadat, deeply moved, said at the signing ceremony. ''In all the steps I took I was merely expressing the\nwill of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.''\nExpels Soviet Advisers\nAnother of Mr. Sadat's major shifts in policy was his departure from Nasser's longstanding pro-Soviet stance. In July 1972 he abruptly ordered the withdrawal of the 25,000 Soviet military specialists\nand advisers in Egypt. By so doing, he later wrote, ''I wanted to tell the whole world that we are always our own masters.''\nThe changes in the relationship with Washington and Moscow were made after Mr. Sadat had concluded that the Arabs could not achieve a satisfactory end to their confrontation with Israel as long as they\nwere allied closely with the Soviet Union while Israel had the all out support of the United States.\nHe was able to make such sharp policy shifts in part because for much of his later tenure as President, his power did not seem to be seriously challenged at home. A career officer and longtime confidant\nof Nasser, he was named Vice President in 1969, came out ahead in a brief power struggle after Nasser's death in 1970 and was formally made President by a rubber-stamp vote of members of the\nArab Socialist Union, the only legal political organization. He consolidated and enlarged his power in the spring of 1971 when, with the aid of the army, he forestalled what he said was a coup and\narrested his opponents.\nCalled Himself a Peasant\nMr. Sadat was widely though not universally popular with the Egyptian people, with whom, in his highly emotional way, he felt a warm and almost mystic bond. In ''In Search of Identity,''\nhe proudly called himself ''a peasant born and brought up on the banks of the Nile.''\nEarly in his presidency, Mr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by eliminating many of the police-state controls that Nasser had relied on to keep himself in power in the years after the officers' revolt\nthat brought down the monarchy in 1952.\nIn 1973 Mr. Sadat did much to build national self-respect when he ordered Egyptian troops to cross the Suez Canal; they managed to overrun the heavily fortified Israeli positions on the east bank within\na few hours. That confidence lingered although the Israelis counterattacked, putting a large tank force on the west bank.\nAs an administrator, he concerned himself with broad lines of policy and for the most part left it to his subordinates to carry it out. Though an emotional man, he could conceal his feelings and be devious.\nHe repeatedly lied his way out of trouble when he was a young officer plotting a military revolt, and as President he pulled off a master stroke of deception when he concealed his preparations for\nthe 1973 war, which began with a surprise attack on Israel.\nMr. Sadat had many quirks. He disliked offices and rarely appeared at Abdin Palace, Cairo's equivalent of the White House, preferring to work in his modest villa and in Government-owned rest houses\naround the country. He wore elegantly cut British-style suits, though even as President he liked to stroll around his native village in a long Arab shirt. He never learned to dance. He could be the\nhigh-toned statesman one minute, relishing his associations with other world leaders, and the humdrum homebody the next, always beginning the day with a dose of Eno's Fruit Salts, a British-made\naid to digestion.\nFirst Steps\nMohammed Anwar el-Sadat was born Dec. 25, 1918, in Mit Abul Kom, a cluster of mud-brick buildings in Minufiya Province between Cairo and Alexandria. He was one of the 13 children of Mohammed el-Sadat,\na Government clerk, and his part-Sudanese wife, a heritage manifest in the boy's skin, darker than the average Egyptian's.\nMinufiya lies in the fertile Nile Delta, its irrigated fields producing rich crops of flax and cotton. In those lush surroundings young Anwar's early years passed happily. He wrote later that he\nhad especially relished the sunrise hour ''when I went out with scores of boys and men, young and old, taking our cattle and beasts of burden to the fields.''\nHis first schooling was at the hands of a kindly Islamic cleric, Sheik Abdul-Hamid, who instilled in him a deep and lasting faith in Islam; as an adult Mr. Sadat bore a dark mark on his forehead, the\nresult of repeatedly touching his head to the floor in prayer.\nToo Poor to Buy Store Bread\nIn 1925 the father was transferred to Cairo, and the family moved into a small house on the outskirts of the capital, not far from Kubba Palace, one of the residences of Egyptian kings. Anwar gave early\nevidence of the audacity he repeatedly showed in later life, stealing apricots from the royal orchard.\nThough the elder Mr. Sadat rose to be a senior clerk, the family was poor, so poor that it could not afford to buy bakery bread. In his memoirs President Sadat said that his early experience of village\nlife, with its ''fraternity, cooperation and love,'' gave him the self-confidence to make his way in the big city, ''It deepened my feeling of inner superiority, a feeling\nwhich has never left me and which, I came to realize, is an inner power independent of all material resources.''\nIn time the proud schoolboy, like other idealistic Egyptians of his generation, came to have a burning political desire: he wanted his country freed of the control of Britain, which had maintained troops\nthere and exercised sway in other ways since the decline of Ottoman Turkish power late in the 19th century.\nWanting to play a role in Egypt's future, Mr. Sadat decided to become an officer. Despite his family's lack of influence, he managed to gain admission to the Royal Military Academy, which was\nonce a preserve of the aristocracy but had begun taking cadets from the middle and lower classes. Graduating in 1938, he was assigned to a signal corps installation near the capital. From that central\nlocation, as he later told it, he became active in the formation of an organization of officers who wanted to mount an armed revolt against the British presence.\nBritain as the Main Foe\nWhen World War II broke out, Captain Sadat continued to regard Britain as the main enemy and took part in a clandestine attempt to fly a former Chief of Staff, Gen. Aziz el-Masri, out of the country\nafter the Germans had sent a message asking him to proceed to Iraq to work against British interests there. The plane crashed, the attempt failed and Captain Sadat was arrested and interrogated but\nlater was released for lack of evidence.\nUndeterred, Captain Sadat made contact with two Nazi agents who passed the evenings watching the dancers at the Kit Kat, a leading Cairo nightclub. Their heavy spending brought them under surveillance,\nthey were arrested and interrogated, and they implicated their contact. As a result a swarm of British and Egyptian detectives and intelligence officers searched Captain Sadat's home. His hidden\ncache of homemade explosives went undetected, b ut he was arrested and sent to a succession of jails. While in jail, he profited from the time by polishing his English and learning German.\nIn 1944 Captain Sadat went on a hunger strike and was transferred to a prison hospital, where he dodged his guard, jumped into a friend's car and escaped. He then grew a beard and lived as a fugitive\nfor a year, helping for a time with work on a resthouse being built for King Farouk, who later was to be ousted by the junta of which Captain Sadat was a part.\nFree to Plot Once Again\nWith the end of the war came the lifting of the martial-law regulations under which Captain Sadat had been detained, enabling him to resume his real identity in freedom. He also resumed plotting against\nthe British and their Egyptian supporters. After a fellow conspirator assassinated Amin Osman Pasha, an aristocrat who favored the British presence, Captain Sadat was tried as a conspirator and acquitted\nin 1948.\nHe worked for a while in a Cairo publishing house and in 1950 got himself reinstated in the army. He was soon promoted, thanks to help from the dissident officers' clandestine network, the Free\nOfficers Organization, which had been growing in size and power under the leadership of an old friend, Lieutenant Colonel Nasser. The colonel summoned Major Sadat to a rendezvous in Cairo on July\n22, 1952, saying the long-awaited uprising, now focused on King Farouk, was to take place soon. When Nasser did not appear, the major took his wife to the movies. Arriving home late in the evening,\nthey found a note from Nasser saying operations were beginning that night and directing Major Sadat to join the revolutionaries.\n''My heart leapt,'' Mr. Sadat recalled in one of his books, ''Revolt on the Nile.'' ''I tore off my civilian clothes and threw on my uniform. In five\nminutes I was at the wheel of my car.''\nAt army headquarters, where the rebels had taken control, Nasser told him to take over the Cairo radio at dawn and to broadcast a proclamation announcing the coup. Major Sadat carried out that historic\ntask after waiting for the daily reading from the Koran to be completed.\nThe revolution led to the exile of Farouk, the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and, before long, the emergence of Nasser as strongman and President.\nWas Underestimated\nAlthough Mr. Sadat filled high posts during the Nasser era, his abilities were underestimated by many influential men in the Nasser entourage. For more than a decade he was given a succession of jobs\nthat were highly visible but of secondary importance. He served as a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, secretary general of an Islamic congress, editor of two newspapers, minister of state\nin the Cabinet; deputy chairman, chairman and speaker of the National Assembly and chairman of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council.\nWhen Nasser named Mr. Sadat Vice President, it was widely thought that he got the job because it was largely ceremonial and had no real power, but supporters of Mr. Sadat have contended that Nasser chose\nhim to be his successor. Nasser, at odds with many other longtime associates, retained warm relations with Mr. Sadat.\nUpon Nasser's death of a heart attack, Mr. Sadat, as the only Vice President, automatically became Acting President under the Constitution. In that office and in his first months as President he\nhad to share power in a collective leadership with others; some colleagues supported him for the presidency because they thought he could be manipulated.\nIn those first weeks many Egyptians, especially students and young intellectuals, found it difficult to take him seriously. With his grin, his fancy suits and his frequent hollow-sounding vows to wage\nwar on Israel, he did not seem to be a strong and purposeful leader.\nPower\nHe showed his strength of will when, after a few months, he moved to consolidate his power by dismissing and imprisoning two of the most powerful figures in the regime, Vice President Ali Sabry, who\nhad close ties with Soviet officials, and Sharawy Gomaa, the Interior Minister, who controlled the secret police.\nMr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by displaying an intuitive sense of what the people wanted. He was doing what they wanted when he cut back the powers of the hated secret police, when he ousted the\nSoviet military experts and when he prepared for war with Israel. Nevertheless, Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister when he took office, correctly appraised him, she later wrote, as a ''reasonable\nman who might soberly consider the benefits'' of ending the confronta tion with Israel.\nEarly in 1973 Mr. Sadat decided to go to war against Israel. He was being criticized by students and others as an ineffective leader, and he concluded that it was necessary to break the Egyptian-Israeli\ndeadlock. ''If we don't take our case into our own hands, there will be no movement,'' he said in an interview. ''The time has come for a shock. The resumption\nof the battle is now inevitable.''\n'Landmark' for Egyptians\nAfter Moscow approved a limited Egyptian invasion of Sinai and after more Soviet arms arrived, Mr. Sadat ordered the attack on Oct. 6. Egyptian troops surged across the canal and Syrian troops struck\nIsrael from their side. In the fighting that followed, the Syrians were thrown back and the Israelis counterattacked fiercely, encircling Suez and carving out a broad bridgehead west of the canal.\nDespite Israel's strong showing, Mr. Sadat, in his memoirs, maintained that ''the Egyptian military performance was a landmark in world military history'' and that ''if\nthe United States hadn't intervened in the war and fully supported Israel, the situation could have been far different.''\nThe war spurred Washington to work to ease tensions in the Middle East; Mr. Sadat was soon visited by Mr. Kissinger. The two hit it off from the first and, Mr. Sadat wrote, began ''a relationship\nof mutual understanding culminating and crystallizing in what we came to describe as a 'peace process.' '' Before long Mr. Kissinger was able to work out a disengagement agreement\nbetween Egypt and Israel that allowed the Egyptians to take back a strip of Sinai. Mr. Sadat welcomed American participation and said later, ''No one else except the United States can play\nthis role of mediator between two sides that harbor intense hate for one another - a gulf of bad blood, violence and massacres.''\nThe agreement, signed in January 1974, was followed by months of ''shuttle diplomacy'' by Mr. Kissinger and by a second limited Egyptian-Israeli accord in September 1975. Efforts\ntoward a more comprehensive peace agreement bore no fruit in the next months, however, although the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on Oct. 1, 1977, on principles to govern a Geneva conference\non the Middle East. Syria continued to resist such a conference.\nNeed for a New Approach\nAt that point Mr. Sadat, not wanting to let Moscow and Damascus determine the pace of events, decided that a new approach was needed. Disregarding objections from his advi sers, he made the trip to Jerusalem.\nHe told the Israeli Parliment that Egypt's willingness to ''welcome you among us'' amounted to ''a decisive historical change,'' but he continued to insist\nthat the Israelis withdraw from occupied Arab land and recognize what he call ed the rights of the Palestinians. He claimed a new-found friendship with Mr. Begin and set in motion the first high-level\nEgyptian-Israeli peace talks.\nWhen Mr. Sadat returned to Cairo, he told his people that ''all barriers of doubt, mistrust and fear were shattered.'' But the negotiations bogged down over differences on the Palestinians\nand other issues; by January 1978 they were deadlocked, with Mr. Sadat denouncing the Israelis as stiff-necked. That deadlock prevailed until Mr. Sadat met with Mr. Begin and President Carter in\nSeptember 1978 at the Camp David conference called by Mr. Carter. Two weeks of talks produced signed agreements on what was called ''a framework for peace.''\nAfter further efforts Mr. Carter flew to Jerusalem and then to Cairo on March 13, 1979, with compromise proposals to break yet another deadlock, and Mr. Sadat approved them quickly in a meeting at a\nCairo airport. Later that month Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin signed the treaty, ending 30 years of Egyptian-Israeli confrontation. ''Let us work together,'' Mr. Sadat said, paraphrasing\nthe Prophet Isaiah, ''until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.''\nIn the hard-line Arab protest against the treaty, 17 Arab nations adopted political and economic sanctions against his Government. Yet his isolation in the Arab world did not undercut his domestic support;\nhe deftly reaped political profit from the isolation by underscoring the idea, widespread in Egypt, that other Arabs had grown wealthy while the Egyptians had borne the burden of the four wars.\nEconomy Displayed Strength\nHis popularity benefited also from the fairly strong condition of the economy, which had seemed on the brink of disaster after Egypt's catastrophic defeat in the 1967 war. By late 1979 the economic\ngrowth rate had reached 9 percent a year and was one of the highest in the developing world, thanks largely to more than $1 billion a year in American aid.\nPresident Sadat's relations with the Americans and the Israelis, despite some intense friction, remained relatively harmonious in the months after the signing of the treaty. That good will paid\noff when, as a gesture of friendship, Mr. Begin fulfilled one provision of the treaty ahead of time, returning a 580-square-mile tract of Sinai to Egypt on Nov. 15, 1979, instead of on Jan. 25, as\nscheduled. Yet no real progress was made in months of Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on home rule for the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nEarly in 1980 Mr. Sadat held inconclusive talks with Mr. Begin at Aswan, in upper Egypt. Israeli forces withdrew from more of Sinai, leaving two-thirds of the area evacuated. The Israeli-Egyptian border\nwas declared open, and the two countries exchanged ambassadors. In March 1980 Mr. Sadat drew new criticism at home and in unfriendly Arab capitals when the deposed Shah of Iran, who was ill, moved\nto Cairo, accepting a longstanding invitation.\nAs the new decade got under way, President Sadat seemed confident of his policies, but events seemed to have taken a somewhat unfavorable turn. Cairo's isolation in the Arab world and elsewhere\nin the third world was galling, and the almost total reliance on Washington for food, aid and weapons was a source of concern.Inflation was running at a rate of 30 percent a year, there were signs\nof increasing repression, and Israel's policy of multiplying settlements on the occupied West Bank intensified pessimism.\nIn April 1980 President Sadat visited Washington to discuss the Israeli settlements with President Carter. From there he denounced the Israeli policy as ''unfounded, ill-conceived and illegal.''\nDissent\nIn the final months of Mr. Sadat's life, as his intricate and sometimes stormy dialogue with Israel continued, there were repeated expressions of internal opposition to his rule. They continued,\nand mounted, despite his general popularity and his continued use of such means as government food-subsidies to dampen disconent.\nEarly this year Egypt's leftist National Unionist Progressive Party publicly denounced Mr. Sadat's policies toward Israel. ''This so-called normalization with the Israeli enemy was\ndone at the expense of the Arabs and was opposed by a growing number of Egyptians,'' a party statement said.\nIn June a Government prosecutor said a former Egyptian Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Saad Eddin el-Shazli, and 18 other Egyptian dissidents living abroad had plotted to overthrow Mr. Sadat. They were said\nto have been given $2.8 million by Libya at Syria's urging. And the head of the Egyptian Bar Association complained that Mr. Sadat's regime was trying to dismember the as sociation's\nleadership because it had opposed the peace treaty with Israel.\nYet Mr. Sadat continued to give much of his attention to foreign affairs. In June he met inconclusively with Mr. Begin, for the first time in 17 months. In the meeting in an abandoned restaurant at Sharm\nel Sheik in Sinai, the Israeli leader rejected Mr. Sadat's appeal to halt Israeli attacks on Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.\nDenounced Bombing of Iraq\nA few days later Mr. Sadat was denouncing Israel for its bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, which he called an ''unlawful, provocative'' act. It was embarrassing to him because\nMr. Begin had told him nothing about it.\nOn Aug. 3 Egypt and Israel signed an agremeent establishing a 2,500-member international peacekeeping force in Sinai to police their peace treaty. On Aug. 5 and 6 Mr. Sadat held friendly but inconclusive\ntalks with President Reagan in Washington. And on Aug. 25 and 26 he and Mr. Begin met yet again, this time in the Egyptian port of Alexandria, to try to resolve problems that had delayed normalization\nof relations.\nBut then Mr. Sadat turned his full attention to internal affairs, evidently acting in response to information about the extent of dissidence in his perennially unstable land. Citing Moslem and other\nopposition to his regime, he departed markedly from the largely velvet-glove treatment of opponents that had characterized his 11 years of rule.\nHe cracked down hard, detaining 1,600 opponents, mostly Moslem militants, partly in response to bloody rioting in June between Moslems and members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. After a hastily\ncalled referendum, his Government reported that 99.45 percent of the voters endorsed its measures to curb secular as well as religious dissidence. Moslem dissidents resented the rapprochement with\nIsrael and wanted a more Islamic cast to Egypt's government.\n'Suffering' From Democracy\nAt a news conference Sept. 9, Mr. Sadat made a wry reference to his country's heritage of violence and to the opposition to his rule. To a foreign reporter who asked an impertinent question, he\nsaid, ''In other times I would have shot you, but it is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.''\nAlso last month Mr. Sadat accused a dozen former Egyptian officials of ''conniving'' with the Soviet Union to destabilize his Government. He ordered the expulsion of more than 1,000\nSoviet citizens, including the Soviet Ambassador, Vladimir P. Polyakov.\nThe Government-supervised Egyptian press reported that Egyptian intelligence had uncovered anti-Government plotting by Soviet agents in league with Egyptian religious extremists, leftists, Nasserites,\neducators, journalists and others.\nLater in the month - even as officials of Egypt, Israel and the United States held talks in Cairo seeking a plan for self-rule for Palestinians - Mr. Sadat's Government took further action to quell\ndissidence. Among other measures, uniformed guards in university campuses were reinforced. A sweeping investigation of the bureaucracy was decreed.\nSaid Indiscipline Had Ended\nIn a widely quoted speech, Mr. Sadat asserted, in what proved to be a display of overconfidence, that all of Egypt's internal indiscipline had come to a halt.\n''Lack of discipline in any way or form,'' he said, in a two-hour televised address, ''in the streets, in the Government, in the university, in the secondary schools, in\nthe factory, in the public sector, in the private sector, this all has ended, it has ended.''\nIn Israel, however, a long-time observer of Mr. Sadat was already speaking of the possibility that his work might be snuffed out. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Raphael Eitan, said bleakly,\n''There are troubles in Egypt, and it is possible that President Sadat will go and everything will come to an end.''\nMr. Sadat was divorced from his first wife, who was from his native village; they had three daughters. His second wife, Jihan, has played a strong role in public affairs, particularly concerning the\ncondition of women and children. The four children of his second marriage are a son, Gamal, named for Nasser, and three daughters, Lubna, Noha and Jihan.\n''In Egypt, personalities have always been more important than political programs.'' - ''Revolt on the Nile,'' 1957.\n''Don't ask me to make diplomatic relations with them. Never. Never. Leave it to the coming generations to decide that, not me.'' - On Israel in 1970, a few months before he became President.\n''The situation here - mark my words - will be worse than Vietnam.'' - In a magazine interview, July 1973.\n''We have always felt the sympathy of the world, but we would prefer the respect of the world to sympathy without respect.'' - In a speech to the People's Assembly after the\nfirst attack of the Yom Kippur war, Oct. 6, 1973.\n''Let every girl, let every woman, let every mother here - and there in my country - know we shall solve all our problems through negotiations around the table rather than starting war.''\n- During his visit to Israel, November 1977.\n''I have a great ally in Israel that I depend upon. Do you know who? The Israeli mother.'' - Commenting on the vote of approval by Israel's Parliament of the peace treaty between\nEgypt and Israel, March 22, 1979.\n''In all the steps I took I was not performing a personal mission. I was merely expressing the will of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.\n''Today a new dawn is emerging out of the darkness of the past. ''Let us work together until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning\nhooks.'' - At the peace treaty signing between Egypt and Israel at the White House, March 26, 1979. ''There will be no barriers between our peoples, no more anxiety or insecurity,\nnot more suffering or suspicion.'' - Meeting with Menachem Begin at Beersheba, May 27, 1979.\n''It is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.'' -Speaking to foreign journalists of unrest in Egypt, Sept. 9, 1981.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nAs President Trump prepares to meet his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G-20 gathering in Argentina this weekend, tough American tariffs and a broader bilateral trade relationship are at the top the agenda.\nBut what about concerns that the Trump administration has expressed in the past over Beijing\u2019s repression and mass internment of Uighurs and other Muslims? Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top lieutenants, like Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have called attention to the Uighurs\u2019 plight, but given the president\u2019s fixation on tariffs, he may well decide to hold his fire about the Uighurs to appease Mr. Xi in pursuit of a trade deal. So it\u2019s no surprise that the White House is refusing to say whether the Uighurs will be on the agenda.\nThe dilemma Mr. Trump faces has some faint echoes from 1989, when President George H.W. Bush had to figure out how to recalibrate relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre. Of course, Mr. Trump lacks the experience or subtlety that Mr. Bush \u2014 a former director of the C.I.A. and envoy to China \u2014 brought to that fraught diplomatic moment.\nMr. Bush \u201cwanted to safeguard the underlying geopolitical relationship,\u201d his secretary of state, James Baker, wrote in October. Still, Mr. Baker added, \u201cThe United States could not be viewed as a cynical paper tiger on human rights.\u201d\nAt that time, China was just beginning the economic reforms that would eventually make it an international force to be reckoned with, and relations with the United States were at a peak. Responding to pressure from Congress and international outrage over the widely publicized Tiananmen Square killings, the Bush administration imposed limited sanctions on Beijing while maintaining dialogue with Chinese officials.\nToday, when another, more hostile strategic realignment between Beijing and Washington seems to be underway, there is again an urgent need to address at the highest levels of the American government what have been described as China\u2019s worst human rights abuses in decades. They are largely happening in secret to a group of people who are little known outside China.\nMr. Xi has imposed China\u2019s most sweeping internment program since Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution, when more than a million people were killed and millions of others were imprisoned, tortured and humiliated.\nAs Mr. Pompeo and other senior officials have acknowledged, Chinese officials are forcibly holding hundreds of thousands \u2014 perhaps more than one million \u2014 Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs and other Turkic-speaking Muslims in camps across the northwest Central Asian border region of Xinjiang without any formal legal process.\nThere have been credible reports of torture, starvation and death in the camps. There are, as well, accusations that officials have forced detainees to renounce traditional Islamic practices and swear allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday, CNN reported that a Chinese photojournalist, Lu Guang, had disappeared in China after being seized by authorities in Xinjiang.\nOverlaying all of this is a sophisticated surveillance system that uses cameras, biometric data and phone apps to reinforce state control. Officials reportedly have also deployed more than a million Chinese civilians, mostly members of the country\u2019s Han majority, to occupy the homes of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang in order to indoctrinate and monitor them. The Uighurs, numbering about 11 million, are the largest ethnic group in Xinjiang.\nBeijing argues that the crackdown is needed to combat extremism and terrorism on its western frontier and says that many of those detained are common criminals. But Mr. Pompeo has said that Uighur \u201creligious beliefs are decimated.\u201d\nAnd Mr. Pence, in a hard-hitting speech in October, lambasted a \u201cnew wave of persecution\u201d that is \u201ccrashing down on Chinese Christians, Buddhists and Muslims.\u201d He said the Uighurs \u201cendure round-the-clock brainwashing\u201d as part of a \u201cdeliberate attempt by Beijing to strangle Uighur culture and stamp out the Muslim faith.\u201d\nSuch rhetoric helped focus more international attention on the campaign of oppression against the Uighurs, but it\u2019s not nearly enough. While Western countries have begun to speak out, where is the outrage from Muslim countries? Why aren\u2019t China\u2019s neighbors demanding an end to the abuses?\nThe world can ill afford to remain mute, as it did for too long when the generals in Myanmar began unleashing genocide against the Rohingyas, members of a Muslim ethnic group that have been killed by the thousands and forced to flee to Bangladesh.\nFor several months, administration officials have been discussing whether to impose punitive measures on China over its treatment of Uighurs. In mid-November, lawmakers in Washington introduced legislation that would level sanctions on specific Chinese officials and limit the sales of American technology products to certain Chinese state agencies.\nIf Mr. Trump refuses to confront Mr. Xi in Argentina and take strong measures against Chinese officials for their mass repression, Congress will be obliged to act.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Plenty of policy on Capitol Hill is driven by statements that the border with Mexico is porous or claims that cities there are being overrun with illegal immigration and drug violence.\nBut in nearly half a dozen years of covering homeland security issues, I\u2019ve found that rhetoric about the border emanating out of Washington offers little resemblance to what\u2019s on the ground.\nIn many ways, border cities and towns and the people who live there are no different from those who live in the rest of the United States: People go to work; drop their children off at school; shop at giant outlet malls like the Outlet Shoppes at Laredo, a two-story building home to over 50 stores that sits just a few feet from the Rio Grande.\nTo be sure, human smuggling remains a problem on the border, and thousands of stash houses, buildings were smugglers keep migrants or drugs, dot the landscape of many border cities. And billions of dollars of cocaine and other drugs \u2014 including deadly substances like fentanyl \u2014 are smuggled across the border each year. But more often than not, the interactions between the two sides of the border are innocuous.\nAs the New York Times homeland security correspondent, I spend a good amount of my time reporting on various bills and policy proposals to secure the border. Much of this starts in government agencies and press briefing rooms in Washington, far from those who would be affected by the changes, which is why I try to visit the border as often as I can to see how these policies shape the lives of people living there.\nThere is a sense of interconnectedness between these borders towns and their Mexican counterparts. Each day, about one million people cross the border from either side for shopping, business and recreation. It\u2019s common to see children coming into the United States from Mexico to go to school, and thousands of United States citizens who live in Mexican border towns commute to work in American cities every day.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see people across the river as people living in another country. We see them as our family, as part of the same community,\u201d Pete Saenz, the mayor of Laredo, Tex., told me during a trip there in August. That sentiment is widespread in many areas along the border, where family ties on both sides go back centuries. (To be sure, there are complaints from landowners about migrants and drug smugglers crossing private property and many people who support building President Trump\u2019s border wall.)\nI admit that as someone who grew up far from the border, I, like most Americans, once had no idea just how linked these border communities are. It\u2019s another reason there\u2019s a need for on-the-ground reporting from these communities that challenges narratives around them.\nDuring my most recent trip to the southwest border, I went to San Ysidro, just south of San Diego, days after border agents used tear gas to to disperse about 500 migrants who overwhelmed Mexican border guards and rushed the port of entry.\nAfter a tour with officials from Customs and Border Protection, I spent time driving around and talking to people at shopping malls, barber shops and even IHOP (my go-to spot on the road). What I found was a variety of attitudes about the migrants. But most people emphasized that the event in no way suggested that border towns were any more dangerous than other American cities. \u201cIt\u2019s just like anyplace else, there is good and there is bad here,\u201d a barber at Supreme Barbershop in Chula Vista told me.\nAnd despite claims that border communities are crime-ridden or overrun by drug cartels, the truth is these towns and cities tend to be safe: From 2011 to 2015, all but one of the 23 United States counties along the border had violent-crime rates lower than the national average for similar counties, according to federal crime data analyzed by Christopher E. Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.\nWhile illegal border crossings and drug smuggling continue, years of increased spending on border security means that federal authorities now know more about what\u2019s happening on the border. Apprehensions of migrants at the border, which are used by the Department of Homeland Security as a measure of illegal entry, have been on a general downward trend since the mid-2000s, data shows. Predator drones fly over the border daily, along with tethered surveillance blimps repurposed from their use by the military to track the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nFederal agents deploy thousands of sensors that can detect movement. And there are more than 17,000 Border Patrol agents patrolling on land and water, along with thousands of customs officers manning the southwest border\u2019s 48 ports of entry. Nearly 700 miles of border are already fenced off \u2014 all before President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall is completed. But still there is a sense of normalcy there, of people just trying to get through their days and weeks.\nAfter years of reporting on border security issues from Washington, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the policy debates and overlook what\u2019s actually happening in places like Laredo. But by making sure I make regular trips to the border, I can put the human implications of policies in the forefront of my reporting.\nKeep up with Times Insider stories on Twitter, via the Reader Center: @ReaderCenter.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Raids Home of Atlantic City Mayor Frank Gilliam\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe mayor of Atlantic City made headlines last month when he was involved in a fight outside a casino that was captured on video. The mayor, Frank Gilliam, was not charged.\nBut Mr. Gilliam may be facing more serious trouble. Early Monday, federal officials raided his home, removing computer equipment and boxes in an operation that represents another setback for this struggling seaside city.\n\u201cThe F.B.I. was at the mayor\u2019s home in Atlantic City in an official capacity executing a search warrant,\u201d said Doreen Holder, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.\u2019s office in Newark. Ms. Holder said the I.R.S. was also involved in the search, but she declined to offer any other details.\nVideo posted on social media showed about a dozen agents going in and out of the home on Ohio Avenue.\nThe mayor\u2019s office declined to comment about what prompted the raid.\n\u201cWe can tell you that the mayor\u2019s office is open, and we are here to provide services to Atlantic City residents and to serve the administration in any way that we can,\u201d said Christina Bevilacqua, the deputy chief of staff in the mayor\u2019s office.\nShortly after 12:30 p.m. Monday, Mr. Gilliam emerged from his house and left in a Mercedes-Benz S.U.V. He did not respond to shouted questions from reporters gathered at the end of his driveway.\nThe F.B.I. operation is the latest chapter in what has been a tumultuous couple of months for Mr. Gilliam, a Democrat. The late-night brawl he was involved in took place outside the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City; surveillance video obtained from the casino showed the mayor swinging wildly at an unknown man. Casino security intervened to break up the fight.\nThe cause of the melee has never been made clear. Prosecutors said they would not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Gilliam.\nMr. Gilliam has also faced complaints about his campaign finances. The mayor and the Atlantic City Democratic Committee quarreled over a $10,000 check that had been made out to the committee, but that Mr. Gilliam deposited into his campaign account.\nThe committee filed a criminal complaint in March, but a judge later dismissed the case.\nMr. Gilliam was elected in 2017, defeating the incumbent mayor Don Guardian, a Republican who had clashed frequently with the administration of former Gov. Chris Christie over the state\u2019s decision to take over Atlantic City\u2019s finances. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy as its casino industry struggled.\nMr. Gilliam, a native of Atlantic City who had served as a city councilman since 2009, campaigned on a \u201cnew era\u201d message, saying that Atlantic City\u2019s struggles were the result of poor management of city government and the casinos. He faulted Mr. Guardian for allowing the state takeover and said the largely Democratic city needed to return to its Democratic roots.\nHe promised to court developers and bring in businesses. Since taking office, two casinos have opened where old ones had shuttered.\nBut he also promised to broaden Atlantic City\u2019s appeal, seeking to establish the resort city as a family-friendly destination.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our identity because of gaming,\u201d Mr. Gilliam said during the campaign. \u201cIf everyone got to the table, Atlantic City would find its way.\u201d\nThe F.B.I. raid on Mr. Gilliam\u2019s home, however, is a reminder of the long history of criminal behavior among some of Atlantic City\u2019s top public officials.\nRobert W. Levy, who was elected mayor in 2006, disappeared in 2007 amid rumors of a pending federal investigation into his military record and benefits. He was found to have checked into an addiction and rehabilitation facility in central New Jersey, and later admitted in court to falsifying his military records to receive veterans benefits.\nIn 1991, James L. Usry, who had been mayor for six years and was Atlantic City\u2019s first elected African-American mayor, pleaded guilty to campaign contribution violations after prosecutors accused of him accepting $6,000 in cash and a $500 check in exchange for supporting an ordinance that would have benefited a business owned by the donor. Mr. Usry and four city councilmen were indicted.\nAnd in 1984, Michael J. Matthews, who had been elected mayor in 1982, was charged with extortion, bribery and conspiracy as part of a wide-ranging sting operation against organized crime. Federal authorities said he maintained a close relationship with Nicodemo \u201cLittle Nicky\u201d Scarfo, an infamous organized crime leader, that predated Mr. Matthews\u2019s election as mayor. Mr. Matthews pleaded guilty to a single count of extortion.\nAtlantic City also played a central role in the Abscam scandal, which resulted in the convictions of several members of Congress on charges of bribery and political corruption, including Senator Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey.\nAt the center of the scandal were promises for casino partnerships and revenue in Atlantic City.\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you Atlantic City \u2014 without me, you do nothing,\u201d Angelo J. Errichetti, who was then mayor of Camden, N.J., boasted to an undercover agent about arranging a casino license for a $50,000 kickback.\nAlain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But the high-flying devices have also triggered backlash over fears they will be used to spy on law-abiding citizens.\nThe New York Police Department on Tuesday unveiled plans to deploy 14 of the unmanned fliers and to train 29 officers to operate them, opening an intense debate about whether an agency previously criticized for illegally surveilling citizens should possess such powerful technology.\nSenior police officials said the drones would be used for monitoring giant crowds, investigating hazardous waste spills, handling hostage situations and reaching remote areas in crime scenes, among other tasks. They will not be used for routine police patrols, unlawful surveillance or to enforce traffic laws, the officials said. Nor will they be equipped with weapons.\n\u201cDrone technology will give our cops and their incident commanders an opportunity to see what they\u2019re getting into before they go into harm\u2019s way,\u201d Chief of Department Terence A. Monahan said. \u201cFor this reason alone, it would be negligent for us not to use this technology.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cLet me be clear: N.Y.P.D. drones will not be used for warrantless surveillance.\u201d\nBut lawyers specializing in civil liberty cases who reviewed the department\u2019s proposed drone policy said it did not go far enough in preventing the police from misusing the devices. Advocates for police reform expressed alarm about the department\u2019s growing surveillance capacity. Aside from drones, the police have thousands of cameras in public places, license plate readers and devices that can siphon information from cellphones by mimicking cellphone towers.\nChristopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said police officials rejected recommendations that would have required the department to regularly disclose how often they use the drones and why.\nThe N.Y.P.D. will voluntarily report aggregate data regarding the drone program, said Devora Kaye, a department spokeswoman.\nThe department\u2019s policy also allows the use of drones for any \u201cpublic safety\u201d reason the Chief of Department deems necessary. That leaves room for the police to use the drones however they want, with no public oversight, Mr. Dunn said.\n\u201cI understand why they want us to bless it, but we\u2019re not going to bless it,\u201d he said.\nOther critics, including public defenders and elected officials, have also raised concerns the drones might be used to spy on black and Hispanic neighborhoods that have long been targets of aggressive policing practices. These detractors also have raised the possibility the video from the drones could also be exploited by the Trump administration to target immigrants.\nDan Gettinger, the co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, said privacy concerns are likely to grow as the technology becomes more widespread and the capabilities of the machines increase. More than 900 law enforcement agencies currently use them, he said.\n\u201cDrones are a very dynamic platform,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re one thing today, but the technology is going to evolve and sensors are going to become more sophisticated.\u201d\nThe use of drones by police departments soared after the federal government eased licensing requirements in 2016. The Las Vegas police have used them to monitor New Year\u2019s Eve festivities on The Strip, and the police in Cleveland have used them to pursue suspects.\nBut protests surfaced over their use in Los Angeles, and in Seattle, where public pressure forced the police to ground their drones in 2013.\nThe New York State Police have 18 drones, which troopers use for tasks like finding missing people and projecting flood depths. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to use a drone than to launch one of our helicopters, and it\u2019s less expensive,\u201d Beau Duffy, a spokesman, said.\nPolice officials in New York City said they were considering using drones in 2014, and last year the department ordered three for testing. By June, the department had purchased 14. The program cost about $480,000.\nMany police departments have started drone programs without the blessing of local authorities, purchasing the devices with federal funds, private donations or through loopholes in procurement processes. The New York Police Department, however, consulted with local elected leaders, among others, on a policy for using drones before they were deployed, officials said.\nOfficials demonstrated the devices at a closed-door meeting with a few City Council members on Sept. 27 at Police Headquarters, then met with the civil liberties lawyers to discuss the policy on Oct. 5.\nDonovan Richards, a Democrat and the chairman of the City Council\u2019s Committee on Public Safety, said the police were right to seek outside input before launching the drones.\nAlthough Mr. Richards said he understood the potential value of the flying devices, he said he would seek to fast-track legislation requiring the police to report on how often the department uses drones and why, and establishing privacy safeguards.\n\u201cWhat we want to avoid is \u2018mission creep,\u2019 where you start with the use of drones for traffic and before you know it, it\u2019s being used for surveillance,\u201d Mr. Richards said.\nBut some critics said the secrecy surrounding the program has fueled skepticism of the agency\u2019s willingness to operate transparently.\n\u201cDrones are serious surveillance tools that can be weaponized,\u201d said Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform, an umbrella coalition. The lack of public input and oversight in developing the drones program \u201creflects a dangerous anti-democratic pattern of the de Blasio administration and the N.Y.P.D. that disregards the perspectives of communities most impacted by police abuses,\u201d she added.\nThe Police Department bought the drones between April and June from DJI Technology, a company based in China. Eleven of the devices are Mavic Pro quadcopters, which measure less than two feet in diameter. Two of them are M210 RTK quadcopters, which are larger, weather-resistant models equipped with powerful camera lenses capable of thermal and three-dimensional imaging. The police also bought a DJI Inspire quadcopter for training pilots.\nEach drone is flown by a two-person team from the Technical Assistance Response Unit: One officer mans the controls, while the second monitors the device while it is in flight.\nAt a demonstration at Fort Totten in Queens, police drone pilots demonstrated several scenarios in which the devices could be helpful. One drone was used to provide an overview of a scene meant to resemble a fatal car crash. In the second scenario, two drones were flown to take pictures of a mock hazardous materials leak involving a van.\nThe larger drone provided thermal imaging of the smoking car while the smaller drone flew close enough to get a vantage on the vehicle\u2019s open doors.

Pressure increased in recent days as the Italian Parliament severed its relations with Egypt\u2019s legislature, and Egypt\u2019s ambassador to Italy was summoned to discuss the case.\nThe fate of Mr. Regeni remains a national preoccupation in Italy that can still command front-page attention. Rights groups say the case highlights the brutal methods employed by Egypt\u2019s security services.\nThe Egyptian government did not immediately respond to the prosecutors\u2019 announcement, but it had already rejected Italian efforts to place its officials under investigation. \u201cCharges should be based on evidence and not suspicions,\u201d the State Information Service said on Sunday in a statement prompted by Italian news reports.\nThe suspects are already known to the Egyptian authorities, Italian officials said. Prosecutors mentioned the five in a 70-page police report delivered to Cairo last year. They were interrogated by Egyptian officials several times this year, but did not provide useful information or convincing answers, a senior Italian investigator said.\n\u201cWe had to give a strong signal at this point,\u201d said the investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\u201d\nStill, Italian officials admit they have limited leverage over Egypt, which will decide the fate of the five suspects, all male employees of one of Egypt\u2019s powerful main security agencies.\nAnd even if they were brought to trial, it is unclear whether they would be held responsible for the torture and killing of Mr. Regeni, who was in Egypt to research labor unions for his thesis at Cambridge University in Britain.\nThe National Security Agency officers followed Mr. Regeni after his arrival in Cairo, but Italian and American officials believe that one of Egypt\u2019s two other major security agencies, both of which have close ties to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, may also have played a role in his death.\nOne of those agencies, Military Intelligence, was once led by Mr. Sisi and has grown immensely powerful since he came to power in a 2013 military takeover. The other, the General Intelligence Directorate, is led by a longtime loyalist of the president and is dominated by Mr. Sisi\u2019s son Mahmoud el-Sisi.\nThe five suspects identified by Italian prosecutors occupy much lower positions in Egypt\u2019s security apparatus. Nonetheless, the Italian announcement is at least a notable shift in the tone of an investigation that has always been troubled by delays and dead ends.\nIn March 2016, Egyptian officials faced accusations of a botched cover-up after the Cairo police shot and killed five men they had accused of killing Mr. Regeni. Italy rejected that explanation, even after the Egyptian police produced Mr. Regeni\u2019s passport, which they said had been found in an apartment of one of the dead men, \u2014 indirect proof, Italian officials said, that the true culprits were with Egyptian security.\nItalian patience with the dragging investigation appeared to run short last week, after a meeting in Cairo between Egyptian and Italian prosecutors.\nThe two sides discussed surveillance footage from the station where Mr. Regeni was believed to have disappeared in January 2016. After Egypt handed over the footage in May, Italian officials were dismayed to discover that the portions where Mr. Regeni might have been present had been erased.\nAt the meeting in Cairo, the Egyptians showed their Italian counterparts an email from a Russian engineer explaining that the frames in question had been overwritten by later surveillance recordings. The same day, the Rome Prosecutor\u2019s Office said it would issue an order to put National Security Agency suspects under investigation.\nOn national television in Italy, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Roberto Fico, called the move \u201cfair, strong and courageous,\u201d and announced that Parliament was breaking ties with its Egyptian counterpart. Shortly after that, Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi summoned the Egyptian ambassador, Hisham Badr, and urged the Egyptian government to act quickly and show \u201ctangible progress\u201d in the investigation, according to a statement.\nSince coming to power in June, Italy\u2019s populist coalition government has vowed to press Mr. Regeni\u2019s case. The deputy prime ministers, Matteo Salvini, who leads the League Party, and Luigi Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, met separately with Mr. Sisi in Cairo over the summer. Both said the Egyptian president had repeated earlier assurances of full cooperation in the investigation.\nIn practice, though, Egyptian officials often seem concerned with tangential matters. In its statement on Sunday, the State Information Service questioned whether Mr. Regeni\u2019s visa was in order at the time of his death because he had entered Egypt on a tourist visa.\nMr. Regeni\u2019s supporters dismissed the issue as another attempt to muddy the waters. \u201cIt\u2019s just another delaying tactic,\u201d said Paz Z\u00e1rate, a lawyer and friend of Mr. Regeni. \u201cThe Egyptians tried to blame Giulio many times for things that were irrelevant or invented. He would never do anything illegal.\u201d\nFollow Declan Walsh and Gaia Pianigiani on Twitter: @declanwalsh and @gaia_pianigiani.\nDeclan Walsh reported from Cairo, and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Our photographer spent three days behind the scenes.\nSupported by\nNeon hues of orange and pink glistened off the wet sidewalks and the fulsome chrome grills of a Buick Super and Ford Customline. Outside a diner, under bluish curls of cigarette smoke, a crowd milled around in the darkness. Men well under the age of 70 unironically wore pants hitched high above their waists. And women accessorized their outfits with pillbox hats and pearls, illuminated by the glow of a storefront window rather than a smartphone.\nExperiencing these predawn tableaux late last summer, it was as if one city block\u2019s worth of mid-20th-century Americana had seeped from a well-preserved Kodachrome photo onto the streets of the West Village. But these street scenes were actually the stunning handiwork of the creators and the behind-the-scenes magicians of \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d about an Upper West Side housewife (Rachel Brosnahan) who aspires to be a comedian in the New York of the late 1950s. (The show returned for a second season on Amazon on Wednesday.)\nWhile period pieces are nothing new, the attention to detail on \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d transcends the usual nostalgic kitsch. As much consideration is paid to the paper coffee cups, pretzel tins and No. 2 pencils as to the dresses, suits and hats. Hoping to capture not just the look but the feel of the era, I photographed over several days and one long night the meticulous transformation of an old Williamsburg bank into the B. Altman department store, a Midtown Manhattan television studio into a telethon set circa 1959, and, for a flashback scene, a West Village luncheonette into a period diner. And to learn how \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d pulls off these dramatic changes, and what it\u2019s like to be enveloped in this throwback world, Alexis Soloski spoke to the key members of the production team and an assortment of extras. \u2014 TODD HEISLER\n\u201cI love that era. I was born in 1947, so I kind of relate to it. You hold your head up with a hat on and you smile differently, and you carry your handbag differently. You feel good.\u201d \u2014 Carmen Cooper, an extra (below)\nOne of the charms of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d is the way it whooshes viewers back to a dream of 1950s New York \u2014 a city of flair and sass. The colors sing; the interiors gleam. But the fantasy is deeply rooted in realism.\n\u201cWe make sure all the details are just right,\u201d said Bill Groom, the show\u2019s production designer. \u201cThe color palette\u2019s very important, the types of fabric, the technology of the period. We look through electrical catalogs and plumbing catalogs. When we go into a modern location, we change light switches and all sorts of things to make it real. We don\u2019t want anything to pull the viewers out of the story.\u201d\n\u201cBackground work is a chance to meet people from a whole array of careers. It\u2019s fun! And then you get that extra boost when family and friends say, I saw you on TV, even though it\u2019s four or five seconds and you were blurred.\u201d \u2014 Kevin Barksdale, extra (above, far right)\nThe energy and vitality of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d depends on some active and surprisingly inventive camera work. The penultimate episode of the new season includes scenes set at a telethon. David Mullen, the show\u2019s director of photography, couldn\u2019t find working cameras of the period so he had dummy bodies built and inserted small black-and-white surveillance cameras underneath them.\n\u201cWe actually hired Local 600 camera operators,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cA lot of them had live TV experience \u2014 they\u2019ve worked on various New York shows like \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 \u2014 so they knew how to use a pedestal camera. I couldn\u2019t use our own camera operators because they were actually shooting the operators shooting the scene! It got quite complex. I had three camera crews shooting the three camera crews shooting the telethon.\u201d\n\u201cI will say, that\u2019s the largest hat I\u2019ve ever worn, it was so grand. There was a real sense of femininity and luxury.\u201d \u2014 Courtney Leigh Halford, featured extra (above, right)\n\u201cWhen the assistant put me in the bra and the slip and I looked in the mirror at the very different body silhouette, she said to me, \u2018Welcome to the \u201950s.\u2019\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Kilburg Reedy, extra (below, far left)\nDonna Zakowska\u2019s title is costume designer, but she\u2019s responsible for much more. Every accessory and ornament \u2014 the hats, the gloves, the shoes, the stockings, the handbags, the jewelry, the ties, the handkerchiefs, the cuff links \u2014 fall under her purview.\n\u201cIn terms of the men\u2019s clothing, I used a lot of photos of Cary Grant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat look is very classic to America \u2014 there\u2019s a simplicity, a directness, a square, more boxy cut, very elegant. In 2018, some men don\u2019t even know how to tie a tie, forget a bow tie. You also have to tell them, \u2018Please, can you pull up your pants.\u2019 For women, there is much more of an emphasis on clean lines and shape and the contrast between the waist and the hips.\u201d\n\u201cWe never want to go over the top with accessories, they just have to all work together. Every morning, before Rachel goes on set, we usually have the clothes in place and I have a tray filled with certain jewelry choices. We like to spend a few minutes playing. It\u2019s the last thing, the cherry on the cake.\u201d\nWhen actors come in off the street, they\u2019re scrubbed clean, then made up in a late-\u201950s style, under the direction of Patricia Regan, the head of the makeup department.\n\u201cI have to be honest with you, I don\u2019t wear any makeup \u2014 not ever,\u201d she confided. \u201cBut for the show, I have one red lipstick that I absolutely love. It\u2019s YSL 201. It\u2019s the red that Rachel wears when she performs in the black dress. It\u2019s a really rich, flawless, beautiful red. I have tried so many red lipsticks in the past couple of years. I would find beautiful colors, but they wouldn\u2019t stay on, they wouldn\u2019t read, but this lipstick is the perfect lipstick.\u201d\nMeanwhile, conjuring 1959 Manhattan on the 2018 New York grid is the job of the locations manager Amanda Foley. To recreate B. Altman & Company, the luxury department store where Midge works, Ms. Foley turned to a former bank building that now houses the Williamsburg Art & Historical Center.\n\u201cA lovely couple who are very into the arts, they rented it to us for two years,\u201d Foley said. \u201cThe bones are there and we were able to have it for the whole first two seasons so we could spend a lot of time in there making it exactly what we needed it to be, this whole beautiful B. Altman department store. The exterior we shot at the original B. Altman department store on 34th Street. It\u2019s now a CUNY library.\u201d\nWhen a diner was called for, Foley located the West Village spot La Bonbonniere. The production rechristened it The City Spoon. The interior was the simple part \u2014 once some photos were removed, it could pass for the era. The hard part? The street outside.\n\u201cWe have to take out the parking signs, we have to take out the bus poles, we have to get permission from the M.T.A. to take those down,\u201d Foley said. \u201cWe have to cover light poles to make them look more 1959. We change light fixtures, we cover signs. We move garbage cans, we move all the cars on the block and replace them with our own cars.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a really nice chunk of a Manhattan block,\u201d she added. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was easy for us to turn it into 1959.\u201d\nAdvertisement", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

That was the subject of our front-page story on Wednesday. (You can read it here.)\nThe mayor \u201crarely meets with many of his commissioners\u201d according to a review of his public schedules. (Read those here).\nAt times, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s schedule is \u201cmaking it difficult for department heads to advance new ideas at City Hall, or to inform the mayor about problems at their agencies,\u201d The Times\u2019s William Neuman reports.\nJust ask Joe Esposito, commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management, whose firing this weekend took three days. Why? Because Mr. Esposito demanded to hear directly from the mayor.\nThe data: In 2015, he averaged 17 days a month at City Hall; in 2016 it fell to 14; last year, it dropped to nine.\nThis year through September, Mr. de Blasio averaged 10 days, according to his schedules.\nThe stay-at-mansion mayor: Mr. de Blasio said he preferred working at his official residence, Gracie Mansion.\n\u201cI have found it\u2019s a very productive place to get work done,\u201d he said. \u201cCity Hall is a wonderful place, I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life there and I\u2019m there on a regular basis, but it is a place filled with a lot of interruptions and distractions.\u201d\nHe said the public should focus on results, not his governing style, and that the city is in strong shape.\nMayor or May-eh? A poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University found that only 43 percent of voters approve of his job performance, the lowest in more than two years.\nThe percentage of voters who say they don\u2019t know or have no opinion of Mr. de Blasio is increasing \u2014 17 percent in Wednesday\u2019s poll, up from 6 percent in May.\nFor emails and memos, first lady follows the mayor\u2019s rules\nThe same rules about preserving documents and emails that apply to Mayor de Blasio also apply to his wife, Chirlane McCray, a spokesman told The Times on Wednesday.\nWhy it matters: City Hall said last week that \u201cCity Hall employees are under no requirement to retain every email ever written or received\u201d by the mayor.\nThat was meant to explain why the administration did not turn over a couple of emails between the mayor and a disgraced political donor that surfaced in a police corruption trial.\nLook ahead: Ms. McCray has long been touted by the mayor as one of his most trusted advisers. And her portfolio seems to be expanding, with the hiring last week of a federal affairs strategic adviser.\nBest of The Times\nHow do they do that?: A photographer spent three days behind the scenes to find out how \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d recreates 1950s New York so well.\n\u2018I want to live like a human being\u2019: A cutting-edge program to help mentally ill people live on their own has endangered those who were not ready.\n\u2018I\u2019ve Had One Hell of a Year\u2019: That\u2019s Harvey Weinstein, in an email he sent to friends criticizing police investigators.\nUnderground and elevated: How smoking weed can save the city\u2019s subways.

The father, No\u00e9 Aguilar, was denied on the spot because American officials worried he lacked strong ties to Guatemala, his native country, and might not return, according to his lawyer, Naimeh Salem.\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, with past administrations, we never had a problem like this,\u201d Ms. Salem, an immigration lawyer based in Texas, said in an interview. \u201cWith this administration, most everything that is discretionary is getting denied.\u201d\nAs the news of Mr. Aguilar\u2019s denial was reported on Thursday in North Carolina, some high-ranking state politicians pledged to help. Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wrote a letter asking for the State Department to reconsider the father\u2019s application, Ms. Salem said, and the office of Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican, intervened as well.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful we should be able to get it,\u201d Ms. Salem said.\nIn his letter, Mr. Cooper asked the American ambassador to Guatemala, Luis E. Arreaga, to reconsider the visa applications for Mr. Aguilar. He wrote that other relatives of Hania who live there, including a grandfather and an aunt, had applied for a visa, and some of them were also rejected.\n\u201cAs you can image, the family is devastated by the loss of such a promising young lady who loved her family, friends and was one of the top students in her class,\u201d Mr. Cooper wrote on Thursday. \u201cI urge you to reconsider those decisions and to grant visas to those individuals so that they can properly mourn their lost child in this tragic and extraordinary circumstance.\u201d\nMr. Meadows\u2019s office did not respond to a message seeking comment. A State Department spokeswoman, Nicole Thompson, said she could not comment on specific visa cases.\n\u201cThe Department of State makes every effort to facilitate legitimate travel by international visitors,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are also fully committed to administering U.S. immigration law and ensuring the integrity and security of our country\u2019s borders.\u201d\nResidents of Guatemala must receive a visa to travel to the United States.\nHania was kidnapped on the morning of Nov. 5 outside her mother\u2019s house in a mobile home park in Lumberton, N.C., a city of 21,500 people about 30 miles south of Fayetteville. Witnesses said they saw a man wearing dark clothes and a yellow bandanna force Hania into a sport utility vehicle, the police said.\nThe search for Hania dominated the news across the state and the South, as the F.B.I. joined the case and coordinated a vast search over several weeks. The authorities had few clues. They released surveillance footage from a camera showing the S.U.V. and asked the public to look out for shoes similar to the ones Hania was last seen wearing, black-and-white Adidas sneakers with a colorful logo on the heel.\nAfter a nearly three-week search, the police found Hania\u2019s body off a rural road about seven miles south of Lumberton, the authorities said. The F.B.I. declined to elaborate about why that area had been searched but said agents were following up on \u201cinvestigative leads.\u201d\nA spokeswoman at the F.B.I., which prominently displays information about the case on its website, said on Thursday that the case remained unsolved.\nIn his visa application, Mr. Aguilar stated that he owned a business in Guatemala and had no intentions of staying in the United States after the funeral, Ms. Salem said. But embassy officials denied his request because he had a low bank balance, she said.\n\u201cHe has no negative immigration history,\u201d Ms. Salem said. \u201cNo deportation.\u201d\nMr. Aguilar lived in the United States when his daughter was an infant but moved back to Guatemala around 2005, she said.\nWhile President Trump has largely, and loudly, focused his immigration policy on the border, his administration has quietly reshaped the country\u2019s legal flow of foreigners, including those seeking to travel, work or study in the United States. Work visas are being denied or delayed at high rates, companies have said. Colleges have worried about attracting international students who need visas. And foreigners already in the United States have found it more difficult to extend their stays.\nMs. Salem said she had worked on numerous similar requests in past years for family members who wanted to visit a sick relative or attend a funeral in the United States. She said she could not think of another case with similar circumstances that had been denied.\n\u201cHe has never attempted to come back to the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has no desire to come to the U.S. He wanted to kiss his daughter goodbye.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Specifically, who will control the next internet age, and by whose rules will it be run?\nUntil recently, that answer was clearly the United States, from which the Internet sprang, wiring the world together and, in the process, resulting in the greatest creation of power and wealth in history. While China has always had a strong technology sector, in recent years it has significantly escalated its investment, expertise and innovation, with major support from the government.\nThat hand-in-glove relationship creates obvious issues, and the Trump administration is right to stop pretending that China does not present a threat both from security and innovation perspectives.\nThe arrest of Ms. Meng isn\u2019t the first time the United States has cracked down on Chinese companies. This year the No. 2 Chinese telecom maker, ZTE, was slapped with a $1 billion fine for violating trade rules, and the Singapore-based Broadcom was blocked from buying the San Diego-based Qualcomm.\nBut the high-profile arrest of Ms. Meng underscored a new and disturbing spiraling in the already complex relationship the tech industry has with China and the Trump administration.\nThe Justice Department had been investigating Huawei on suspicion of having violated sanctions against exporting American technologies to Iran, and the arrest of Ms. Meng appears to be part of that effort. Since Huawei has become a global powerhouse in smartphones and equipment for the mobile networks, it\u2019s no surprise that scrutiny about whose interests it is serving would increase. The company\u2019s founder, and Ms. Meng\u2019s father, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, which had long set off warning bells among American intelligence officials about Huawei\u2019s ties with the Chinese government.\nAll this makes the move against Ms. Meng look like a particularly bold one and a message to China that the United States has come to play.\nThe government has a lot to be concerned about. As critical 5G \u2014 fifth generation \u2014 wireless networks roll out over the world, many are being deployed by Huawei. These are the networks that will usher in the next age of innovation, and the idea of China \u2014 which pretty much exemplifies the surveillance economy \u2014 dominating that age is troubling.\nBut I am perplexed about why the Trump administration has been such an embarrassment when it comes to the kind of actual leadership and vision needed to keep the United States at the forefront of the tech race.\nOur government\u2019s commitment to investment in what\u2019s coming next is the best counterpart to vigilance against competitors like China. Instead, we are seeing a loud but decidedly empty effort to promote the idea that tech manufacturing should return to the United States (it won\u2019t) and a very weak commitment to bringing qualified tech and science minds into the centers of power (a good pick for the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy has yet to be confirmed after being nominated this year).\nThis week, the White House released a five-year plan around STEM education \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math \u2014 that is not nearly robust enough to make the Chinese even slightly nervous that we can keep up with their decidedly more aggressive efforts to train their work force for the next era of computing.\nAlso this week in the White House, a round-table was held to debate topics like artificial intelligence, 5G wireless and quantum computing, with top tech executive such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Google, Safra Catz of Oracle and Steve Mollenkopf of Qualcomm in attendance. It was called a \u201clistening session,\u201d and it was reported that President Trump \u201cpopped\u201d in, at a time when these issues need far more sustained attention from the top than that.\nWhich is why it came as no surprise when The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump was not briefed about the planned arrest of Ms. Meng, even though it took place at the same time he was having dinner with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in an attempt to find a truce in the trade war.\nFrom where I sit, the sentiment in Silicon Valley seems to be: Good for the government for being tough on Chinese companies when they break the rules \u2014 that rule-breaking having been a longtime complaint of companies like Cisco and Apple. Vigilance is key, of course, but everyone would feel a lot more confident if the government was also focused on investing more in American innovation and if the crackdown looked less chaotic.\nWhich is why you can imagine a big American tech executive being detained over unspecified charges while on a trip to Beijing. And our government should, too.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\nKara Swisher, editor at large for the technology news website Recode and producer of the Recode Decode podcast and Code Conference, is a contributing opinion writer. @karaswisher \u2022 Facebook", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The former F.B.I. director Robert Mueller, whom the N.F.L. tapped to investigate its handling of the Rice matter, wrote in his report on that case that \u201cthe NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information\u201d about the episode.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In the last case, it\u2019s as though the specter of a Relationship That Could Have Been is peeping over your shoulder, keeping tabs without having to commit to any real-world interactions.\nNaturally, there is a name for this 21st-century phenomenon, which has joined ghosting, Netflix and chill, breadcrumbing and other recent entries to the dating lexicon. It\u2019s called orbiting.\nUnlike ghosting, which is a fancy word for disappearing from a lover\u2019s life without notice, orbiting could not have existed before the dawn of social media. It is a behavior bound to the medium, and to an age in which people can be hyper-connected without ever speaking. Distant methods of digital observation \u2014 likes, views, etc. \u2014 are what binds the orbiter and the orbited. The phrase has been floating in the social stratosphere for at least a year now: It cropped up in a Youtube video in November 2017, with a slightly different definition, and this April, was defined in its current form by Anna Iovine in an article for Manrepeller.\nThe way it feels to be orbited depends on your relationship to the orbiter. When you\u2019re interested in the satellite entity watching your social media activity, orbiting brings an endorphin rush, the feeling of being circled by someone you want to get closer to.\nBut when it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s bad. There\u2019s the frustration of wondering why an ex would rather watch your life than be part of it. There\u2019s the disappointment when someone who has been orbiting for some time never does get any closer. And there\u2019s acceptance of the hard truth of all digital romance: Eventually the relationship must be taken offline, or brought to an end.\nKristine Mahan, 23, of Denver, came to experience orbiting after a \u201cpainfully digital\u201d seven-months-long relationship with someone who lived in Minnesota while she lived in Boston. One day, not two weeks after they had last visited each other, he stopped responding to texts and Snapchats all at once and without warning, as if the past several months had been simply deleted.\n\u201cOne thing he didn\u2019t stop doing, though, was watching my Stories and liking photos on Instagram,\u201d Ms. Mahan said. At first she felt hurt by the silence and confused by her ex\u2019s sustained surveillance of her online life. But after some time, Ms. Mahan came to see the behavior as a form of contact. \u201cI felt the urge to send subliminal messages via my Instagram Stories, knowing that was the only way I could communicate with him,\u201d she said.\nIan Coon, 21, of Des Moines, ditched Snapchat altogether, in part because of the number of former friends and dates who were orbiting his account. When he met his current boyfriend, he said, \u201cif I cared enough to get to know him, I had to text or FaceTime or \u2014 gasp \u2014 go on a date.\u201d\nSometimes, orbiting is so inexplicable that it just feels rude. Alexi Mojsejenko, 22 and living in New York, believes there\u2019s someone from her past who views her Stories to spite her, but withholds likes and comments on her Instagram posts.\n\u201cOrbiting, in this sense, just feels very passive aggressive,\u201d Ms. Mojsejenko said, \u201clike a silent and lonely battle.\u201d\nKate, a 27-year-old living in Colorado, took a more positive view. She says that orbiting has become a form of flirting for many people.\n\u201cThe bold ones will go far and like things from way back, which is definitely saying something,\u201d she said, referencing posts on her Instagram account. \u201cOr they are just clumsy and accidentally showed they stalked.\u201d\nShe said that orbiters avoid liking family photos or scenic pictures. Liking selfies, on the other hand, is an optimal way to orbit someone without acknowledging their existence offline.\nIt should also be said that orbiting isn\u2019t always intentional. Instagram Stories stream seamlessly into one another (and ads), so it\u2019s possible to view someone\u2019s day-to-day updates by accident, without ever digging deeper into their posting history.\nRegardless, it\u2019s a fact that dating is confusing, and orbiting can make that worse. Small online behaviors are infinitely interpretable, making it impossible to understand where you and another person stand. The lurking of a potential connection makes you wonder whether they\u2019ll ever materialize in person. And the orbiting ex only serves to keep you mired in a shadow version of the relationship, wondering, each time he or she views one of your Stories, what happened or what could have been.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Again.", "normalized_article_title": "the week in tech: facebook is in the news. again", "text_content": "Supported by\nThe Week in Tech: Facebook Is in the News. Again.\nEach week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.\nGreetings, friends. I\u2019m Brian X. Chen, a tech columnist, meaning my job is to obsess over tech news so you don\u2019t have to. So here\u2019s the CliffsNotes version of the week in tech.\nI remember a time when tech companies were desperate to be in the news. Just a decade ago, making headlines usually meant a company\u2019s gadget or software product was making a big splash and getting nice publicity. But nowadays, tech companies are more powerful than ever, and journalists are focusing on holding them accountable rather than cheerleading.\nSo I bet Facebook wishes it could be out of the news cycle, even briefly. This week, a British parliamentary committee released confidential Facebook emails and documents as part of its investigation into online misinformation. And they did not make Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social networking empire look good.\nThe documents revealed how Facebook treated user data as a bargaining chip. The social network had a \u201cwhite list\u201d agreement with companies it favored, including Airbnb, Lyft and Netflix. The arrangement involved sharing user data with those parties that other companies were restricted from obtaining.\nThe revelations paint Facebook as if it were the head of an internet syndicate with the mission of making money and crushing competition. That\u2019s a terrible image at a time that Facebook is trying to win back people\u2019s trust by saying its true mission is to connect people with people. In a nondenial statement, Facebook said it never sold people\u2019s data.\nNone of the bad publicity is lost on Facebook employees, as it appears to be affecting morale. BuzzFeed reported that Facebook had divided into three camps: people on Team Zuckerberg, people who believe the press is creating biased narratives, and a group that believes the scandals show that the company is on the brink of a meltdown.\nIncidentally, Glassdoor, a site where people can anonymously rank their employers, released a report this week that found Facebook was the No. 7 place to work of 2018, down from No. 1 last year. (Morale dip aside, that\u2019s still a great overall ranking; I think people just love having Philz Coffee on campus.)\n\u25a0 At least Facebook isn\u2019t alone in hot water. Last Friday (because companies like to save their bad news for weekends) Marriott International revealed that hackers had breached its Starwood reservation system and had stolen the personal data of up to 500 million guests.\nThe stolen data included names, addresses and encrypted credit card details of hotel customers. Hackers also stole travel histories and passport numbers of a smaller group of guests. It\u2019s one of the bigger cybersecurity breaches in history. (Then again, the Facebook breach affecting 30 million accounts, announced last September, was nothing to sneeze at.)\n\u25a0 Another company having a bad news week: Huawei. Meng Wanzhou, a top executive and daughter of the company founder, was arrested last week in Canada at the request of the United States, in a move that will certainly increase tensions between the two countries.\nCanada\u2019s Justice Department said she was sought for extradition to the United States but did not give a reason. The United States government has long expressed concern about Huawei\u2019s surveillance capabilities because of the company\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government.\n\u2022 O.K., O.K., I\u2019ll lighten things up. I wrote a column this week about how I tried to turn my food-obsessed dog, Max, into an Instagram celebrity \u2014 and failed. I tried everything: kissing up to influencers, getting professional consultations and even buying bots, but no dice. Here\u2019s what I learned about the brutal space that is Instagram.\n\u2022 I love New York Times crossword puzzles, and I know many of you do, too. So it was a delight to hear from Sam Ezersky, an assistant editor of puzzles, about the tech tools uses to create the crosswords as well as how puzzle-solving has changed in the smartphone era.\n\u2022 This week there\u2019s been some buzz around 5G, the fifth-generation wireless network from cellular carriers, meaning a faster cellular connection might be closer to reality.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon Wireless announced they would support a yet-to-be-named 5G phone from Samsung next year. The 5G network will theoretically be so fast that people will be able to download movies in seconds. (I\u2019ll believe it when I see it \u2014 I still struggle to get a good 4G LTE signal in San Francisco.)\nBrian X. Chen is the lead consumer technology writer.

At the core of their questions was a concern over the company\u2019s commitment to free expression.\n\u201cAll of these topics \u2014 competition, censorship, bias and others \u2014 point to one fundamental question that demands the nation\u2019s attention,\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader. \u201cAre America\u2019s technology companies serving as instruments of freedom or instruments of control?\u201d\n\u201cBecause a free world depends on a free internet, we need to know that Google is on the side of the free world,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said.\nRepresentative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, highlighted the importance of scrutinizing Google because of the company\u2019s market power in search, cloud-based email and its Android mobile operating system.\nMr. Goodlatte also raised concerns that the liberal-leaning political biases of employees may also affect filtering decisions for its search engine. He mentioned a leaked video the day after the 2016 presidential election showing top officials lamenting the victory of President Trump.\n\u201cThis committee is very interested in what justifies filtering,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said. \u201cGiven the revelation that top executives at Google have discussed how the results of the 2016 elections do not comply with Google\u2019s values, these questions have become all the more important.\u201d\nMr. McCarthy is among several Republican members who have made online political bias a talking point in campaign fund-raisers. Claims of anti-conservative bias within the technology of Google, Facebook and Twitter have been disputed by numerous technologists and academics.\nDemocrats had their own set of tough questions for Mr. Pichai on privacy and the company\u2019s competitive practices. But they also expressed frustration with the political bias claims.\n\u201cI must dispense with the complete illegitimate fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other platforms have anti-conservative bias,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the top Democrat on the committee.\nPraise for Google as Well\nOfficials were expected to be merciless for Mr. Pichai\u2019s first appearance before Congress. When he declined to appear in a Senate hearing in September, lawmakers called the act \u201carrogant,\u201d and they put out an empty chair in his absence.\nThough lawmakers asked Mr. Pichai a variety of pointed questions, they also lauded Google as an American icon.\n\u201cYour company should really be held out as a success story of America\u2019s free enterprise system,\u201d said Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cDespite the nature and scope of today\u2019s hearing, Google is still the story of the American dream,\u201d Mr. Goodlatte said.\n\u201cWe do not want to impose burdensome regulations on your industry,\u201d said Representative Mike Johnson, Republican of Louisiana.\nGoing into a third hour of the hearing, Republicans offered little detail on how they would follow up on concerns about privacy and anti-conservative bias.\nDemocrats, in large part, defended the company of political bias claims.\nRepresentative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, said negative news coverage of members like Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, were perhaps the result of his views on immigration.\n\u201cDon\u2019t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself,\u201d Mr. Lieu said.\nLocation, Location, Location\nDuring Mr. Pichai\u2019s testimony, the first question from Mr. Goodlatte was about whether consumers understand the frequency and amount of location data that Google collects from its Android operating system.\nIt was the first of many questions directed at Mr. Pichai about the collection of location data and apps that run on Android smartphones, some citing an investigation by The New York Times. Mr. Pichai said repeatedly that Google offers users controls for limiting location data collection and that it did not sell user data, carefully avoiding the question of how the company uses such data in the practice of selling advertising.\nThe sharpest exchange came when Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, held up his smartphone and asked Mr. Pichai whether Google was tracking his whereabouts if he walked to the other side of the room.\nMr. Pichai said, \u201cnot by default,\u201d adding that it depended on the congressman\u2019s settings on the apps he had installed. But when Mr. Pichai would not respond yes or no, Mr. Poe raised his voice and said Mr. Pichai appeared to be evading his question.\n\u201cYou make $100 million a year,\u201d he said to Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in the technology industry. \u201cYou should be able to answer that question,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked you don\u2019t know. I think Google obviously does.\u201d\nTaking On Google\nBefore the hearing, Google\u2019s critics drew attention to their grievances against the company that became fodder for lawmakers.\nA group of employees, who organized a walkout of 20,000 workers from the company\u2019s offices last month over its harassment and discrimination policies, released a letter stating that Google\u2019s concessions to the protests were not enough and that it planned to push for the end of mandatory arbitration in all cases and for all employees, including temporary and contract staff. The protests were prompted by an article in The New York Times in October revealing that Google had paid millions of dollars in exit packages to male executives accused of misconduct, while staying silent about the transgressions.\n\u201cBut just as Google wants to convince the public that it can handle consumer privacy matters behind closed doors,\u201d the employee group wrote, \u201cit tells the same to its employees by forcing arbitration, requiring them to waive their right to sue or participate in a class-action lawsuit in all cases of discrimination.\u201d\nSeparately, more than 50 human rights organizations signed a letter to Mr. Pichai demanding that the company stop working on Project Dragonfly, the initiative within Google to build a censored search engine that it may use in the Chinese market. A search engine that restricts content banned by the Chinese government is \u201ctroubling,\u201d the groups said, because it would contribute to repressive censorship and surveillance.\nProblems at Google Plus\nGoogle has eight products with more than one billion monthly users, including search, YouTube and Google Drive, its suite of productivity apps. But a product that has struggled to amass users provided fodder for questions from lawmakers about Google\u2019s handling of user data.\nGoogle announced on Monday that it found a security vulnerability last month in Google Plus, the company\u2019s answer to Facebook. The problem exposed the personal information of 52 million users to third-party developers even if the users had set their information to private. Google said it had no evidence that any developers were aware of or had misused the vulnerability during the six days that the bug existed. Google said it would now move up the timing of when it plans to shutter the consumer version of Google Plus, to April from August.\nIn October, Google announced that it found a similar security issue with Google Plus. Google found this vulnerability in March but did not report it immediately, waiting seven months to disclose the bug because it had found no evidence that anyone had exploited the problem to obtain user information. However, it brought new light to questions about how big technology companies handle user data.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

She will be released upon completion of court paperwork.\nMs. Meng will be subject to 24-hour physical and electronic surveillance, which she plans to pay for herself. The surveillance will include two security guards and a driver, in addition to GPS monitoring. She will also be under curfew between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the judge said.\nMs. Meng, who has been in detention for 10 nights, hugged her lawyers and shook their hands as she cried. Her next court date will be on Feb. 6.\n\u201cI am in Vancouver and back with my family,\u201d she wrote on WeChat, the Chinese social media platform. \u201cI am proud of Huawei and I am proud of my motherland! Thanks to everyone who cared about me.\u201d\nIn a statement, Huawei said, \u201cWe look forward to a timely resolution to this matter.\u201d\nMs. Meng, 46, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1 at the behest of American authorities, sending shock waves throughout China and the United States, which are negotiating to end a trade war. The United States has claimed she deceived financial institutions and caused them to violate sanctions against Iran.\nMs. Meng in particular is being scrutinized for her role in a Hong Kong company called Skycom Tech, which does business in Iran and at one point had Ms. Meng on its board. Huawei also owned shares in the company.\nMs. Meng\u2019s lawyers said that she resigned from Skycom\u2019s board in 2009 and that Huawei divested its stake in the company. But Canadian and American authorities have said Huawei operated Skycom as an unofficial subsidiary, allowing Skycom employees to use Huawei bank accounts and email addresses. Huawei convinced financial institutions that Skycom was independently operated, and the banks then cleared transactions with Skycom that violated United States sanctions against Iran, according to an affidavit.\nThe American government\u2019s case against Ms. Meng appears to center on a 2013 presentation she made to the global bank HSBC, in which she claimed that Huawei had sold its Skycom shares and was no longer directly supervising the company. That presentation constituted fraud, a lawyer from Canada\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office has argued.\nThe United States has 60 days from Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest on Dec. 1 to file a formal extradition request with Canadian authorities. Canada grants around 90 percent of extradition requests that are heard in court, owing to 1999 changes to its extradition laws. If an extradition request is granted, Ms. Meng will have several options to appeal, and the process could take many months.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he would consider intervening in her case. \u201cWhatever\u2019s good for this country, I would do,\u201d he said.\nAuthorities in the United States and Canada had argued Ms. Meng should be held without bail, given her vast financial resources and the fact that China does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.\nDavid Martin, a lawyer for Ms. Meng, initially said that she would offer 1 million dollars in cash and two homes that her husband, Liu Xiaozong, owns in Vancouver, worth about 14 million dollars, to secure her bail.\nBut the bail decision was complicated by the immigration status of Ms. Meng\u2019s husband. Mr. Liu arrived in Canada from China after his wife\u2019s arrest and can stay for six months on a visitor\u2019s visa. A Canadian government lawyer argued that Mr. Liu could not be responsible for Ms. Meng\u2019s bail because he may have to leave the country before her case is resolved.\nMr. Martin said on Tuesday that four family friends and neighbors who are Canadian residents had offered their homes and cash to cover Ms. Meng\u2019s bail, an arrangement that may have eased concerns about Mr. Liu\u2019s immigration status. Some of those who volunteered to help with Ms. Meng\u2019s bail are former Huawei employees.\nFollow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.\nElsie Chen in Beijing contributed research.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But there may have been more to that screen than met the eye.\nAccording to an interview in Rolling Stone, the kiosk took photos of people looking at the videos. The images were sent back to a \u201ccommand post\u201d in Nashville where they were cross-referenced, using facial recognition technology, with a database of people who had been identified as potential stalkers of the pop star.\nThe use of facial recognition was revealed by Mike Downing, the chief security officer of Oak View Group, an entertainment company, who told Rolling Stone that he observed the technology firsthand as a guest of the company that designed the kiosks.\n\u201cEverybody who went by would stop and stare at it, and the software would start working,\u201d Downing told Rolling Stone.\nFacial recognition is proliferating both as a technology to help law enforcement identify criminals and as a convenient feature to help consumers unlock their phones, among other functions. Its use is also growing in the entertainment realm: Madison Square Garden is among the venues employing it.\nThe Swift security team\u2019s reported use of facial recognition, however, could represent a new tactic: luring people to step in front of the camera, rather than just scanning a crowd or waiting for fans to pass by. It was not clear which company designed the kiosk, whether it was used at other concerts, whether any potential stalkers were identified and, if so, what was done about them. The Oak View Group and Swift\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.\nOnly a couple of states have laws restricting the use of facial recognition, and California is not among them. Nonetheless, many civil liberties advocates consider it to be among the most invasive surveillance technologies because it can be used to recognize people at a distance without their knowledge or permission, curtailing their ability to go about their business anonymously in public.\n\u201cObviously, stalking of celebrities is a real problem,\u201d Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview. \u201cThis is a somewhat sympathetic deployment of the technology, but nonetheless, there are a number of concerns about where this goes.\u201d\nMicrosoft has called on Congress to regulate facial recognition. In a blog post on Dec. 6, Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, went further, saying that such a law should require companies to \u201cplace conspicuous notice\u201d where the technology is being used. That way people who don\u2019t want to be subjected to facial recognition might avoid it.\nEarlier this year, civil rights groups, led by the A.C.L.U., asked Amazon to stop selling its image recognition technology, called Rekognition, to law enforcement agencies.\nAmazon employees later sent a letter to Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s chief executive, with similar demands. Amazon has said there have been no reports of law enforcement abuse of the company\u2019s facial technology and that the technology had been used for beneficial purposes, such as reuniting missing children with their families. (The New York Times used Amazon\u2019s services earlier this year to help identify attendees at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.)\nSwift has had several documented instances of stalkers. Just this month, Roger Alvarado agreed to a plea deal that included six months\u2019 imprisonment in connection with a break-in at Swift\u2019s New York City townhouse. The police said he had been asleep in her bed.\nIn 2014, Swift discussed her need for a security detail in an interview with Esquire.\nShe spoke of \u201cthe sheer number of men we have in a file who have showed up at my house, showed up at my mom\u2019s house, threatened to either kill me, kidnap me, or marry me.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the strange and sad part of my life that I try not to think about,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to be lighthearted about it, because I don\u2019t ever want to be scared. I don\u2019t want to be walking down the street scared. And when I have security, I don\u2019t have to be scared.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Want this by email? Sign up here.\nAs China softens on trade, U.S. plays hardball ...\nThe Trump administration, believing Beijing will struggle to change its trade stance, plans to hammer home the idea that it is interested only in strong commitments.\nChina has begun to make good on some concessions. Beijing has reportedly agreed to cut tariffs on imported American cars to 15 percent from 40 percent (although that might not be as significant as it sounds). China also is said to be planning to increase its purchases of U.S. crops.\nBut the administration is wary. Exhibit A is the revelation that the U.S. authorities have traced the recent data breach at Marriott to Chinese hackers. Government officials that spoke to the NYT said the finding \u201cadded urgency\u201d to administration concerns that the trade truce may do little to change Beijing\u2019s behavior. Among those concerns: the potential for the continuing coercion of American companies to hand over valuable technology if they seek to enter the Chinese market and theft of industrial secrets.\nWashington plans to ratchet up the pressure. That could include the indictment of Chinese hackers, the declassification of intelligence reports describing information-gathering practices, and an executive order that would make it harder for Chinese companies to obtain critical components for telecommunications equipment. (There probably won\u2019t be an indictment over the Marriott hacking.)\n\u2026 and the Huawei arrest could become even more important\nThe events surrounding the arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, the C.F.O. of Chinese tech giant Huawei, could figure into the trade fight.\nThe latest: Ms. Meng was released on bail of 10 million Canadian dollars (about $7.5 million). And after threatening Canada with \u201cserious consequences\u201d over the arrest, China has detained the former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig.\nPresident Trump could get involved. In an interview with Reuters, Mr. Trump said he would consider intervening in Ms. Meng\u2019s case if doing so would serve national security interests or increase the likelihood of a trade deal.\nThat runs counter to the view of the U.S. trade representative. Robert Lighthizer said this week that Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was \u201ctotally separate\u201d from his work and that it \u201cshouldn\u2019t really have much of an impact\u201d on trade talks. (An intervention would also pit Mr. Trump against his own Justice Department, which coordinated with Canada on the arrest.)\nTheresa May faces a leadership challenge today\nThe persistent dissatisfaction with the way Prime Minister Theresa May has handled Britain\u2019s looming withdrawal from the E.U. has given way to a no-confidence vote over her role as leader of the Conservative Party.\nWhat happened: The contest was triggered when 48 Tory lawmakers submitted letters of protest. The vote is to take place this evening.\nHow it works: \u201cUnder the party\u2019s rules, Mrs. May needs to win 158 votes from among the 315 Conservative members of Parliament to stay as party leader and therefore prime minister,\u201d writes Stephen Castle of the NYT. \u201cIf she does so, then party members cannot mount another challenge to her leadership for a year, but if she loses the vote, then she withdraws and another leader will be chosen over the coming weeks.\u201d\nWhy it matters: Britain is struggling to find a route that maintains useful political and economic ties with the E.U. without causing economic disaster, and Mrs. May\u2019s decision to postpone a parliamentary vote on her withdrawal plan has plunged the country into greater uncertainty. If she were to be ousted, Britain could be temporarily rudderless at a time of huge political importance.\nComing Up: Tencent Music goes public\nThe Chinese music-streaming company makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange this morning.\nThe news: Tencent Music priced its I.P.O. at $13 a share, raising close to $1.1 billion. At that price, the company is valued at $21 billion. It had originally sought a valuation of $25 billion to $30 billion.\nThe context: Tencent Music filed to go public in early October, but delayed its offering as the stock market experienced a huge sell-off. Market conditions have not improved, and shares of Spotify, Tencent Music\u2019s closest publicly traded peer, are down 30 percent since early October.\nWhy it matters: Airbnb, Lyft, Palantir, Slack and Uber are all expected to go public in 2019. Tencent Music\u2019s I.P.O. could provide an early signal of how volatile markets will receive major tech offerings.\nWhat we learned (and didn\u2019t) when Mr. Pichai went to Washington\nGoogle\u2019s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, took his turn for a congressional grilling. It followed the well-worn pattern established by other tech hearings this year: Lawmakers ask predictable (and, occasionally, ill-informed) questions, and C.E.O.s repeat company lines.\nMr. Pichai mostly followed that script. The Google chief said the company did not suppress conservative views, adding that its \u201calgorithms have no notion of political sentiment.\u201d He deflected questions about privacy by discussing the controls available to users. And Representative Steve King, an Iowa Republican, asked why his granddaughter\u2019s iPhone, a device made by a Google competitor, was acting strangely.\nThe company\u2019s China play became more confusing. Mr. Pichai said Google had \u201cno plans to launch a search service in China.\u201d The Intercept noted that, when asked whether Google would introduce \u201ca tool for surveillance and censorship in China,\u201d he declined to answer. Later, in an interview with the WaPo, Mr. Pichai appeared to broaden his options. \u201cCan we explore and serve users in China, in areas like education and health care?\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand a market.\u201d\nIt may be time for a shake-up. \u201cThis three-and-half-hour hearing was not as worthwhile as it should have been for Congress, the company and the public,\u201d writes Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion. \u201cWhat if, instead of accusations, members of Congress and Google offered solutions?\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s charm offensive\nAmazon is trying to quell rising opposition to its plan for New York offices by hiring lobbyists, reports J. David Goodman of the NYT:\n\u2022 Critics object to the lack of a public review, the potential impact on low-income areas and, most of all, the incentives that could total $3 billion.\n\u2022 Amazon has hired two former city councilmen \u2014 Mark Weprin and Ed Wallace \u2014 to make its case.\n\u2022 Company executives have set up shop in a hotel in Long Island City, the neighborhood where Amazon plans to build a new campus. They have been walking the streets, sometimes accompanied by city officials, to sound out residents.\n\u2022 Opponents can ratchet up the rhetoric, but the deal does not need City Council approval.\nDespite everything, the markets are calm\nGlobal markets were calm and mostly in positive territory today despite the threat of a government shutdown in the United States, potential trouble for U.S.-China trade talks and accelerating political chaos in Britain.\nThere\u2019s one big exception: The pound whipsawed after Conservative lawmakers announced the no-confidence vote, initially dropping below $1.248 before edging up to near $1.255. (The FTSE 100 was up 0.4 percent in early trading.)\nCan a Michigan accelerator spin up Midwestern start-ups?\nRemember how a dozen or so venture capitalists hopped on to a bus for a three-day tour of the Midwest? The idea was for Silicon Valley investors to meet local officials and look for promising start-ups in overlooked parts of the country.\nIt seems to have had some effect. A new accelerator group, 100K Ventures, announced today that it planned to invest in early-stage companies in Flint, Mich. Created by the 32 Ventures founder Robert Wolf in partnership with Phil Hagerman, the founder of the investment firm Skypoint Ventures in Flint, the organization hopes to demonstrate that investing in underserved American communities makes enough sense to expand the scheme nationally.\nAmong the investors in 100K Ventures: the N.B.A. player Draymond Green, the minority owner of the Philadelphia Eagles Christina Weiss Lurie, the former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter, the Girls Who Code founder Reshma Saujani, and the journalist Soledad O\u2019Brien.\nFortune 500 companies aren\u2019t great with email security\nA new study by the cybersecurity company Rapid7 peers into the digital defenses of Fortune 500 companies, with two big tests yielding mixed results.\n\u2022 About 330 companies were found to have weak or nonexistent email defenses to prevent phishing attacks that seek to gather personal information.\n\u2022 On average, the companies each exposed 500 servers or devices to potential hackers. That may sound like a lot, but Tod Beardsley of Rapid7 told Axios that it was \u201clower than I was expecting\u201d given the size of the companies.\nThe bottom line: \u201cCybersecurity basics are being missed or insufficiently deployed even among very large, mature, and well-resourced organizations,\u201d Rapid7 concluded.\nRevolving door\nThe food and agriculture company Bunge ousted its C.E.O., Soren Schroder, and chairman, Patrick Lupo. Mr. Schroder will remain in place until a successor is found. (FT)\nKathie Lee Gifford is to leave NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d in April.

(TechCrunch)\n\u2022 SoftBank reportedly plans to shed its stake in Nvidia next year. (Bloomberg)\nPolitics and policy\n\u2022 President Trump met with Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, and vowed to shut down the federal government if they refused to approve financing for his proposed border wall. Ms. Pelosi later called the project \u201ca manhood thing.\u201d\n\u2022 John Kelly\u2019s departure as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff may be part of a larger shake-up. The president said he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to replace Mr. Kelly.\n\u2022 Some Democrats considering a presidential run may forgo or disavow money from super PACs. (NYT)\n\u2022 The E.U. hoped to put its house in order this year. That didn\u2019t work. (NYT)\n\u2022 Mr. Trump called payments to two women to keep them about quiet about sexual relationships they said they had with him \u201ca simple private transaction.\u201d (NYT)\n\u2022 One of those women, Stormy Daniels, has been ordered to pay Mr. Trump $292,000 in legal fees. (Bloomberg)\nTech\n\u2022 Super Micro, which Bloomberg claims had Chinese spy chips installed on its hardware, said it had found no evidence of such devices. (Reuters)\n\u2022 Mobile ad tech is struggling. TV ad tech, on the other hand, appears to be having a moment. (Axios)\n\u2022 A Facebook building in Menlo Park was evacuated after a bomb threat. No explosive device was found. (Bloomberg)\nBest of the rest\n\u2022 Verizon booked a $4.5 billion accounting charge related to its Oath online media business. (WSJ)\n\u2022 The CBS board didn\u2019t mention Les Moonves at its annual meeting. Separately, the company settled with three women who accused it of not doing enough to stop Charlie Rose from sexually harassing them.\n\u2022 President Trump said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d of the Fed to continue raising interest rates. But tepid inflation could allow the Fed to slow them.\n\u2022 Malaysian prosecutors issued new corruption charges against the former prime minister Najib Razak and the former C.E.O. of 1MDB. (Reuters)\n\u2022 A Tokyo court rejected Carlos Ghosn\u2019s appeal to be released from detention. Nissan has shared the allegations made against Mr. Ghosn with Renault, suggesting that relations between the two companies are improving.\n\u2022 Here\u2019s what the first steak grown in a lab tastes like.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.\nDavid Byrne, \u2018Everybody\u2019s Coming to My House\u2019\nDavid Byrne\u2019s 2018 tour put his whole band in choreographed motion, a spectacle that rivaled the Talking Heads\u2019 1983 extravaganza filmed as \u201cStop Making Sense.\u201d One rave review \u2014 \u201c\u2018 \u2026 The Best Live Show of All Time\u2019 \u2014 NME\u201d \u2014 supplies the title for an EP recorded live in Brooklyn. Even without visuals, \u201cEverybody\u2019s Coming to My House\u201d sheds the nervous, paranoid overtone of the studio version on Byrne\u2019s 2018 album, \u201cAmerican Utopia.\u201d While the lyrics envision ceaseless surveillance and interaction, the sheer funkiness makes it sound like one big house party. JON PARELES\nAmerican Football, \u2018Silhouettes\u2019\nAn arrestingly beautiful lead single from the forthcoming third album by American Football, lonely titans of 1990s emo. Mike Kinsella sings like a nudge, a suggestion: \u201cWhat\u2019s the allure of inconsequential love?\u201d he wonders, at a low enough volume that you know he doesn\u2019t know the answer. All around him, bells peal and guitars swarm and the song gets tense, but only in an internal way. From the outside, there\u2019s no sweat at all. JON CARAMANICA\nRobin Thicke, \u2018Testify\u2019\nIt\u2019s been a challenging \u2026 five(?) years for Robin Thicke: that Miley performance, the dissolution of his marriage, the death of his father, the crumbling of his claim to celebrity. Just this week, he was ordered to pay restitution to the family of Marvin Gaye as part of the final resolution of the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit that accused him and Pharrell Williams of pilfering the key elements of that song from Gaye\u2019s \u201cGot to Give It Up.\u201d After all that, a retreat from the spotlight for good would be understandable, and perhaps advisable. But now comes \u201cTestify\u201d: gentle, self-lacerating, studiously vulnerable. A rather lovely acoustic guitar ballad \u2014 one that moves him toward adult-contemporary R&B, a natural new home \u2014 \u201cTestify\u201d is essentially a litany of failures, shortcomings, disappointments. He lists them sweetly, not defiantly. They are who he is now. These are his confessions. CARAMANICA\nAvril Lavigne, \u2018Tell Me It\u2019s Over\u2019\n\u201cTell Me It\u2019s Over\u201d is a nearly pure retro move for Avril Lavigne. It\u2019s a can\u2019t-leave-you song \u2014 \u201cEvery time you touch me/I forget what we\u2019re fighting about\u201d \u2014 that harks back to early 1960s soul and girl groups, with a slow-rolling 12/8 beat, wall-of-sound orchestration and a fully belted chorus. The 21st-century tipoff, and spoiler, is the ratchety trap high-hat sound that\u2019s likely to make it sound dated rather than classic. PARELES\nEgo Ella May, \u2018Table for One\u2019\nNot to be confused with Ella Mai, Ego Ella May is a singer and songwriter from London who\u2019s on the jazzy side of the neo-soul spectrum, with a fine-line soprano and a penchant for zigzag chromatic melodies. In \u201cTable for One,\u201d she works through the loneliness and disorientation of a breakup \u2014 \u201cI try to reprogram my mind/there\u2019s no change\u201d \u2014 to eventually decide \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all/I\u2019ll be fine on my own.\u201d Her backup band is live and improvisational in the studio, suddenly stirring up gusty, slightly cluttered crescendos and then settling back down, turning the song into an unfinished narrative. PARELES\nTemptation, \u2018All Hail the Silence\u2019\nKnobs, keyboards, monochrome monitors galore. Analog synthesizer geeks should thrill to this video of \u201cAll Hail the Silence\u201d by the duo of the keyboardist and producer BT (Brian Transeau) and the singer and songwriter Christian Burns, whose mission is to record electronic pop without computers. This is the synthesizer version of recording with vintage guitars and tube amps; what once was futuristic now seems homey. PARELES\nFilmore, \u2018Heart\u2019s Having a Hard Time\u2019\nA sturdy and concise pop-soul number masking as a country song, \u201cHeart\u2019s Having a Hard Time\u201d is a sharp introduction to Filmore, a rising country singer with a voice that never flirts with tension. Instead, he\u2019s a gentle mope, peaceful in his resignation to hurt, even though his words capture a sadness that\u2019s potent and pained:\nIt shouldn\u2019t be so tough for me\nto change my lock screen\nbut it\u2019s sinking in\nthat I don\u2019t get to kiss that smile no more\nCARAMANICA\nJason Palmer, \u2018Moonlight Becomes You\u2019\nJason Palmer is one of the great, fine-tuned improvisers of his generation, but the 39-year-old trumpeter, who lives in Boston, remains underrecognized by the jazz public. His newest album, \u201cFair Weather,\u201d probably won\u2019t correct the issue: It\u2019s out on Newvelle Records, a label that operates entirely on a subscription model, requiring buyers to purchase a full year\u2019s worth of records in order to receive anything. But this video for the title track \u2014 a skating, five-beat retrofit of the old ballad \u201cMoonlight Becomes You\u201d \u2014 offers a sense of Palmer\u2019s powers: his way of quietly recasting the harmonies of a tune, and gently pulling a rhythm section together around him as he improvises. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\nYves Jarvis, \u2018Fruits of Disillusion\u2019\nThe Canadian songwriter Jean-Sebastian Audet released a 2017 album under the name Un Blonde; now he\u2019s recording as Yves Jarvis. The disorientation only begins there in \u201cFruits of Disillusion,\u201d a wispy, wavery, deliberately ambling three minutes of low-fi psychedelia. The track begins as a gentle drone with feedback woven in, offers a spoke-sung verse that suddenly sprouts harmonies and wanders off to an unsteady beat. It\u2019s a rumination on \u201cconstant change\u201d that\u2019s secure in its own fragility. PARELES\nKid Koala featuring Trixie Whitley, \u2018All for You\u2019\nThe DJ and producer Kid Koala dissolves the beat in the series of recordings he calls \u201cMusic to Draw To.\u201d His second installment is \u201cIo,\u201d based on the Greek myth of a mortal priestess who attracted the ardor of Zeus and the wrath of his wife, Hera. \u201cAll for You\u201d is a serenely awe-struck lullaby, with Trixie Whitley\u2019s hushed, hazy voice sounding just earthy enough amid shimmering, cyclical chords. PARELES\nCale Brandley with Triptych Myth, \u2018Sunset Park, After the Sun Sets\u2019\nTriptych Myth was a trio led by Cooper-Moore, a lion of the downtown music scene, in the early 2000s, when he\u2019d just ended a yearslong hiatus from playing the piano. \u201cFinding Fire,\u201d recorded in 2005 but not released until this week, is the band\u2019s third and ostensibly final album, and it is a continental statement: widely varied in terms of textures and tones, unfolding like an epic novel, with various stories converging into one.

It said that Israel\u2019s Military Advocate General was examining that failure.\nBut it defended the roof-knocking tactic, insisting it \u201ccoincides entirely with international law\u201d and had been proved \u201ccountless times\u201d to \u201creduce harm to civilians located in or near structures that are military objectives.\u201d\nAnd it denied any effort to distort news coverage of the attack on what Israel called an urban-warfare training center of Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza.\nThe report was published as a video on Monday by B\u2019Tselem, an Israeli human rights group, and Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group that investigates state violence and human rights violations.\nIt pinpointed the moment on July 14, during a daylong exchange of rockets and airstrikes between Israel and Gaza, when Amir al-Nimrah and Luai Kahil were killed: at 5:45 p.m., as they sat with their legs dangling over the edge of an unfinished tower overlooking Al Katiba Square, having just taken a selfie.\n(Amir was widely reported to be 15 years old and Luai a year older, but B\u2019Tselem said on Tuesday that it had obtained documents that put the age of both boys at 14.)\nIn an English-language publication during the 2014 war with Gaza, the Israeli military said it used \u201cloud but nonlethal\u201d bombs for roof-knocking.\nBut videos recorded in July by people who rushed to the rooftop to try to help the two boys showed pockmarks in the concrete surface that the report said matched the shrapnel pattern of an antipersonnel missile.\nThat would be consistent with the Israeli practice of using munitions for roof-knocking strikes that would explode on the surface of a building, rather than pierce it and endanger those inside.\nA government report on the 2014 Gaza war acknowledged that the tactic was \u201cimperfect,\u201d but said that it prevented many civilian deaths and injuries.\nThe boys, however, were seated only about 30 feet from where the missile struck, according to the report.\n\u201cWarning strikes are an essential part of the Israeli military\u2019s claims to high ethical standards,\u201d said Eyal Weizman, director of Forensic Architecture, which has also collaborated with The New York Times. \u201cBut such warnings are sometimes delivered with the same missiles that are used elsewhere to kill,\u201d he said.\nTo support its conclusion that the Israeli military had selectively chosen images used to publicize the attack, the report analyzed video posted online by the military spokesman\u2019s office.\nAll told, four roof-knocking strikes hit the building between 5:45 p.m. and 5:58 p.m., the report found. Four tremendous blasts then quickly destroyed it at 6:02 p.m.\nAbout an hour later, the Israel Defense Forces spokesman\u2019s office issued a Twitter post with a video of the attack, with clips of what looked like four roof-knocking strikes on the building followed by the major explosions. The two teenagers could not be seen on the roof in the first clip.\nBut the report found that the first roof-knocking strike, at 5:45 p.m., was actually missing from the military\u2019s Twitter post.\nIn its place was an additional angle on the third strike, at 5:54 p.m. \u2014 recorded after the boys\u2019 bodies had already been carried away by people who rushed to the roof to try to help them.\nThat prompted the human rights groups to ask whether the Israeli military had suppressed video that might have shown the boys on the roof when the first missile was fired \u2014 or whether it was incapable of conducting airstrikes in populated areas while still meeting its legal obligations to spare civilians.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the boys were visible to the military before the first strike,\u201d said Amit Gilutz, a B\u2019Tselem spokesman. \u201cIf so, they should have aborted. If not, that raises grave concerns as to the military\u2019s surveillance capabilities.\u201d\nThe military spokesman\u2019s office denied any attempt to manipulate coverage of the airstrike. It said that the first visual evidence the military had seen of the two teenagers\u2019 presence on the rooftop \u2014 despite a review conducted in response to news reports of their deaths \u2014 was in the video published on Monday by B\u2019Tselem and Forensic Architecture.\n\u201cAny allegations that the I.D.F. knowingly distorted or edited video footage are totally baseless and false,\u201d it said.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Wiretap Recorded Suspect on Eve of Bike Path Terror Attack\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe Uzbek man charged with using a truck to kill eight people on a Manhattan bike path last year was recorded on an F.B.I. wiretap the day before the attack and was heard on other calls going back three years, according to two court filings by defense lawyers.\nThe filings do not reveal the contents of the conversations or whether the man, Sayfullo Saipov, 30, was overheard making threats or talking about an impending attack. Still, the filings suggested that Mr. Saipov was in touch with other people under F.B.I. surveillance.\nThe attack on Halloween last year was the deadliest terrorist attack in New York since Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Saipov is accused of driving a pickup truck down a bike path along the Hudson River, killing eight people and injuring others. He then crashed into a school bus, ran down the highway waving a pellet gun and a paintball gun and shouted \u201cGod is great\u201d in Arabic.\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers said in court papers that they had received a trove of materials from the government concerning \u201csurreptitious F.B.I. surveillance of Mr. Saipov\u2019s communications.\u201d Those materials included \u201cnumerous audio recordings of conversations between Mr. Saipov and various targets of F.B.I. surveillance,\u201d along with about 1,000 pages of translated summaries of the calls, which were largely in Uzbek, the lawyers said.\nThe lawyers\u2019 filing left open the possibility that Mr. Saipov was not the actual target of F.B.I. surveillance and might have been overheard in conversations with others that the F.B.I. had interest in.\nMr. Saipov was apprehended after a police officer shot him in the abdomen and was charged with eight counts of murder and other crimes. Two F.B.I. agents questioned him through the night as he recovered in the intensive care unit at Bellevue Hospital Center.\nMr. Saipov told the agents he had been inspired to carry out the attack by Islamic State videos that he had watched on his phone, according to a criminal complaint. He also said he began planning the attack about a year earlier and used a truck to inflict maximum damage. He told the agents \u201che felt good about what he had done,\u201d the complaint said.\nThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has not yet responded to the defense\u2019s filings. That office, the F.B.I. and Mr. Saipov\u2019s federal public defenders all declined to comment on the defense\u2019s new filings.\nTerrorism experts said the existence of such intercepted telephone calls \u2014 even where their content and significance are unknown \u2014 underscored the challenge for law enforcement in predicting so-called lone-wolf attacks. Little is known about Mr. Saipov\u2019s comments on the calls.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the picture they paint of Saipov is just not that alarming,\u201d said Bobby Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and co-founder of Lawfare, a national security blog. \u201cBut it could turn out otherwise, and that would raise serious questions about why they didn\u2019t make him a priority, including the possibility of arresting him if grounds existed to do so.\u201d\nKaren J. Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law, said, \u201cThe question it raises in my mind is no matter how much surveillance there is, even right up to the eve of an attack, we still have not figured out exactly what it is that we\u2019re looking for as a sign of immediate danger beyond \u2018I have a gun in my pocket\u2019 or \u2018a bomb strapped to my chest.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers revealed the existence of the covert recordings as part of a request to the judge, Vernon S. Broderick, to suppress Mr. Saipov\u2019s statements after his arrest. They said prosecutors have told the defense that they do not intend to use the intercepted conversations during Mr. Saipov\u2019s trial or any potential death-penalty phase. But in reviewing the F.B.I.\u2019s summaries of Mr. Saipov\u2019s questioning, his lawyers wrote, \u201cit is clear they interrogated Mr. Saipov about matters and contacts that overlap\u201d with the covert surveillance of his communications.\nThe federal government has said it will seek the death penalty for Mr. Saipov if he is convicted at his trial, scheduled for next October in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Saipov was denounced immediately after the attack by President Trump, who wrote on Twitter that he \u201cshould get death penalty.\u201d\nMr. Saipov\u2019s lawyers have asked Judge Broderick to block the government from seeking capital punishment, arguing the comments posted on Twitter and other statements by Mr. Trump had politicized the decision.\nFollow Benjamin Weiser on Twitter: BenWeiserNYT", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

We\u2019re on our own.\nContributing Opinion Writer\nThe Russian trolls have been really good customers of Facebook, Google and Twitter.\nThat\u2019s the key takeaway from reports released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee on efforts by the Russian agents to spread fake stories and discourage Americans from voting.\nLet\u2019s be dead clear: Purveyors of propaganda used these powerful platforms exactly as they were designed to be used. It should not surprise us that what happened was entirely avoidable and pretty much in plain sight of those who ran the platforms.\nNow we know that the tech companies were not particularly helpful in trying to work with government investigators to unravel the mess, asserting that they were in the dark about the situation, both as the deception was happening and well after it was pointed out to them.\nAn article in The New York Times described the \u201cdribs and drabs\u201d of information released by the foot-dragging tech giants: \u201cThe data they did provide \u2018lacked core components that would have provided a fuller and more actionable picture,\u2019 said one of the reports.\u201d That report noted, \u201cRegrettably, it appears that the platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress.\u201d\nRegrets? Apparently, tech has a few, but not enough to do a full mea culpa that might allow us to avoid this kind of disaster in the future.\nWhile all of the companies have insisted that they are committed to transparency, the fact is that they have long been resistant to the kind of self-reflection needed to fix the situation for the long term. The only solution is to overhaul their systems in ways that would force them to behave less like bystanders in what will be a never-ending \u201chigh-stakes information war.\u201d This is the disturbing term used in one of Senate reports that Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a disinformation expert and director of research at New Knowledge, worked on. It looked at over a thousand YouTube videos, upward of 100,000 Instagram posts, more than 50,000 Facebook posts and more than 10 million tweets.\nBack in July, I interviewed Ms. DiResta, who is also the head of policy at the nonprofit group Data for Democracy. She was already sounding the alarm about the lack of information-sharing between tech platforms and independent researchers and the government.\n\u201cEach of the platforms has great visibility into their own platform, and third-party researchers have information and signal from across the platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at dissemination platforms and trends and saying: \u2018We think this is inauthentic. You\u2019ve got device IDs, you\u2019ve got I.P. addresses, you\u2019ve got a number of other signals that we don\u2019t have access to.\u2019\u201d\nIn other words, as was described in more detail this week, the tech giants have been holding back. It\u2019s a crouch posture that I think has its origins in the souring of the industry\u2019s relationship with government agencies in 2013 in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about incursions into tech platforms by the N.S.A. surveillance program Prism.\nThat moment deeply damaged what had once been a more cooperative back and forth between government and tech over issues of national security. While no one in tech was na\u00efve enough to be surprised about some level of government spying on information-rich environments \u2014 you rob banks because that is where the money is, after all \u2014 the level of it was indeed a shock to some.\nI have also heard a number of top tech executives involved in cybersecurity complain that they tried to tell the F.B.I. and other government agencies about potential issues with foreign actors targeting tech companies, but their warnings fell on deaf ears. Engagement, they said, was weak during the Obama administration and became worse under President Trump.\nPerhaps that is no surprise either, given what the new reports confirm about the Russians\u2019 preference for the current administration. One report also revealed that fake social media accounts were used to slime the special counsel Robert Mueller.\nWhat will happen next?\nWashington is taking direct aim at the tech platforms for their lack of cooperation, so we will probably see more regulatory oversight and a push for changes to make them less susceptible to such flagrant abuse.\nBut in the end, such changes may prove impossible, given how the United States thinks about free speech. As the report noted: \u201cWe have conversations about whether or not bots have the right to free speech, we respect the privacy of fake people, and we hold congressional hearings to debate whether YouTube personalities have been unfairly downranked. It is precisely our commitment to democratic principles that puts us at an asymmetric disadvantage against an adversary who enthusiastically engages in censorship, manipulation, and suppression internally.\u201d\nIn short: These systems are so easily taken advantage of precisely because they represent our values.\nFor now, it\u2019s not clear what we can do, except take control of our own individual news consumption. Back in July, in fact, Ms. DiResta advised consumer restraint as the first line of defense, especially when encountering information that any passably intelligent person could guess might have been placed by a group seeking to manufacture discord.\n\u201cThey\u2019re preying on your confirmation bias,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen content is being pushed to you, that\u2019s something that you want to see. So, take the extra second to do the fact-check, even if it confirms your worst impulses about something you absolutely hate \u2014 before you hit the retweet button, before you hit the share button, just take the extra second.\u201d\nIf we really are on our own in this age of information warfare, as the Senate reports suggest, there\u2019s only one rule that can help us win it: See something, say nothing.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\nKara Swisher, editor at large for the technology news website Recode and producer of the Recode Decode podcast and Code Conference, is a contributing opinion writer. @karaswisher \u2022 Facebook", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The confidential plan, reviewed by The New York Times, would also deepen the cooperation between China and Pakistan in space, a frontier the Pentagon recently said Beijing was trying to militarize after decades of playing catch-up.\nAll those military projects were designated as part of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion chain of infrastructure development programs stretching across some 70 countries, built and financed by Beijing.\nChinese officials have repeatedly said the Belt and Road is purely an economic project with peaceful intent. But with its plan for Pakistan, China is for the first time explicitly tying a Belt and Road proposal to its military ambitions \u2014 and confirming the concerns of a host of nations who suspect the infrastructure initiative is really about helping China project armed might.\nAs China\u2019s strategically located and nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan has been the leading example of how the Chinese projects are being used to give Beijing both favor and leverage among its clients.\nSince the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Pakistan has been the program\u2019s flagship site, with some $62 billion in projects planned in the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. In the process, China has lent more and more money to Pakistan at a time of economic desperation there, binding the two countries ever closer.\nFor the most part, Pakistan has eagerly turned more toward China as the chill with the United States has deepened. Some Pakistani officials are growing concerned about losing sovereignty to their deep-pocketed Asian ally, but the host of ways the two countries are now bound together may leave Pakistan with little choice but to go along.\nEven before the revelation of the new Chinese-Pakistani military cooperation, some of China\u2019s biggest projects in Pakistan had clear strategic implications.\nUzbekistan\nKashgar\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nIran\nPakistan\nIndia\nChinese road projects\nChinese port projects\nKarachi\nGwadar Port\n200 miles\nArabian Sea\nUzbekistan\nKashgar\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nPakistan\nIndia\nIran\nChinese road projects\nChinese port projects\nKarachi\nGwadar Port\n200 miles\nArabian Sea\nKashgar\nUzbekistan\nTajikistan\nTurkmenistan\nChina\nKabul\nIslamabad\nAfghanistan\nLahore\nPakistan\nIran\nIndia\nGwadar\nPort\nKarachi\nChinese road projects\n200 miles\nChinese port projects\nA Chinese-built seaport and special economic zone in the Pakistani town of Gwadar is rooted in trade, giving China a quicker route to get goods to the Arabian Sea. But it also gives Beijing a strategic card to play against India and the United States if tensions worsen to the point of naval blockades as the two powers increasingly confront each other at sea.\nA less scrutinized component of Belt and Road is the central role Pakistan plays in China\u2019s Beidou satellite navigation system. Pakistan is the only other country that has been granted access to the system\u2019s military service, allowing more precise guidance for missiles, ships and aircraft.\nThe cooperation is meant to be a blueprint for Beidou\u2019s expansion to other Belt and Road nations, however, ostensibly ending its clients\u2019 reliance on the American military-run GPS network that Chinese officials fear is monitored and manipulated by the United States.\n[Read The Times\u2019s series \u201cChina Rules,\u201d about how China wrote its playbook to counter the West.]\nIn Pakistan, China has found an amenable ally with much to recommend it: shared borders and a long history of cooperation; a hedge in South Asia against India; a large market for arms sales and trade with potential for growth; a wealth of natural resources.\nNow, China is also finding a better showcase for its security and surveillance technology in a place once defined by its close military relationship with the United States.\n\u201cThe focus of Belt and Road is on roads and bridges and ports, because those are the concrete construction projects that people can easily see. But it\u2019s the technologies of the future and technologies of future security systems that could be the biggest security threat in the Belt and Road project,\u201d said Priscilla Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at Recorded Future, a cyberthreat intelligence monitoring company based in Massachusetts.\nAn Asset on the Sea\nThe tightening China-Pakistan security alliance has gained momentum on a long road to the Arabian Sea.\nIn 2015, under Belt and Road, China took a nascent port in the Pakistani coastal town of Gwadar and supercharged the project with an estimated $800 million development plan that included a large special economic zone for Chinese companies.\nLinking the port to western China would be a new 2,000-mile network of highways and rails through the most forbidding stretch of Pakistan: Baluchistan Province, a resource-rich region plagued by militancy.\nThe public vision for the project was that it would allow Chinese goods to bypass much longer and more expensive shipping routes through the Indian Ocean and avoid the territorial waters of several American allies in Asia.\nFrom the beginning, though, key details of the project were kept from the public and lawmakers, officials say, including the terms of its loan structure and the length of the lease, more than 40 years, that a Chinese state-owned company secured to operate the port.\nIf there was concern within Pakistan about the hidden costs of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, also known as CPEC, there was growing suspicion abroad about a hidden military aspect, as well.\nIn recent years, Chinese state-owned companies have built or begun constructing seaports at strategic spots around the Indian Ocean, including places in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Malaysia.\nChinese officials insisted that the ports would not be militarized. But analysts began wondering whether China\u2019s endgame was to muscle its way onto coastal territories that could become prime military assets \u2014 much as it did when it started militarizing contested islands in the South China Sea.\nThen, Sri Lanka, unable to repay its ballooning debt with China, handed over the Chinese-built port at Hambantota in a 99-year lease agreement last year. Indian and American officials expressed a growing conviction that taking control of the port had been China\u2019s intent all along.\nIn October, Vice President Mike Pence said Sri Lanka was a warning for all Belt and Road countries that China was luring them into debt traps.\n\u201cChina uses so-called debt diplomacy to expand its influence,\u201d Mr. Pence said in a speech.\n\u201cJust ask Sri Lanka, which took on massive debt to let Chinese state companies build a port of questionable commercial value,\u201d Mr. Pence added. \u201cIt may soon become a forward military base for China\u2019s growing blue-water navy.\u201d\nMilitary analysts predict that China could use Gwadar to expand the naval footprint of its attack submarines, after agreeing in 2015 to sell eight submarines to Pakistan in a deal worth up to $6 billion. China could use the equipment it sells to the South Asian country to refuel its own submarines, extending its navy\u2019s global reach.\nDeepening Debt\nWhen China inaugurated Belt and Road, in 2013, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s new government in Pakistan saw it as the answer for a host of problems.\nForeign investment in Pakistan was scant, driven away by terrorist attacks and the country\u2019s enduring reputation for corruption. And Pakistan desperately needed a modern power grid to help ease persistent electricity shortages.\nPakistani officials say that Beijing first proposed the highway from China\u2019s western Xinjiang region through Pakistan that connected to Gwadar port. But Pakistani officials insisted that new coal power plants be built. China agreed.\nWith CPEC under fresh scrutiny, Chinese and Pakistani officials in recent weeks have contended that Pakistan has a debt problem, but not a Chinese debt problem. In October, the country\u2019s central bank revealed an overall debt and liability burden of about $215 billion, with $95 billion externally held. With nearly half of CPEC\u2019s projects completed \u2014 in terms of worth \u2014 Pakistan currently owes China $23 billion.\nBut the country stands to owe $62 billion to China \u2014 before interest balloons the figure to some $90 billion \u2014 under the plan for Belt and Road\u2019s expansion there in coming years.\nPakistan\u2019s central bank governor, Ashraf Wathra, said publicly in 2015 that he had no clarity on Chinese investments in Pakistan and was concerned about rising debt levels. It still took him months after that to secure a briefing from cabinet officials.\n\u201cMy main question was, \u2018Do we have any feasibility studies of these projects and a cost-benefit analysis?\u2019 Their answers were all evasive,\u201d recalled Mr. Wathra, who has since retired.\nAhsan Iqbal, a cabinet minister and the main architect for CPEC in the previous government, said the project was well thought-through and dismissed Mr. Wathra\u2019s account.\n\u201cNo one wanted to invest here \u2014 the Chinese took a chance,\u201d Mr. Iqbal said in an interview.\nBut the bill is coming due. Pakistan\u2019s first debt repayments to China are set for next year, starting at about $300 million and gradually increasing to reach about $3.2 billion by 2026, according to officials. And Pakistan is already having trouble paying what it owes to Chinese companies.\nFighter Jets and Satellites\nAccording to the undisclosed proposal drawn up by the Pakistani Air Force and Chinese officials at the start of the year, a special economic zone under CPEC would be created in Pakistan to produce a new generation of fighter jets. For the first time, navigation systems, radar systems and onboard weapons would be built jointly by the countries at factories in Pakistan.\nThe proposal, confirmed by officials at the Ministry of Planning and Development, would expand China and Pakistan\u2019s current cooperation on the JF-17 fighter jet, which is assembled at Pakistan\u2019s military-run Kamra Aeronautical Complex in Punjab Province. The Chinese-designed jets have given Pakistan an alternative to the American-built F-16 fighters that have become more difficult to obtain as Islamabad\u2019s relationship with Washington frays.\nThe plans are in the final stages of approval, but the current government is expected to rubber stamp the project, officials in Islamabad say.\nFor China, Pakistan could become a showcase for other countries seeking to shift their militaries away from American equipment and toward Chinese arms, Western diplomats said. And because China is not averse to selling such advanced weaponry as ballistic missiles \u2014 which the United States will not sell to allies like Saudi Arabia \u2014 the deal with Pakistan could be a steppingstone to a bigger market for Chinese weapons in the Muslim world.\nFor years, some of the most important military coordination between China and Pakistan has been going on in space.\nJust months before Beijing unveiled the Belt and Road project in 2013, it signed an agreement with Pakistan to build a network of satellite stations inside the South Asian country to establish the Beidou Navigation System as an alternative to the American GPS network.\nBeidou quickly became a core component of Belt and Road, with the Chinese government calling the satellite network part of an \u201cinformation Silk Road\u201d in a 2015 white paper.\nLike GPS, Beidou has a civilian function and a military one. If its trial with Pakistan goes well, Beijing could offer Beidou\u2019s military service to other countries, creating a bloc of nations whose military actions would be more difficult for the United States to monitor.\nBy 2020, all 35 satellites for the system will be launched in collaboration with other Belt and Road countries, completing Beidou.\n\u201cBeidou, whatever any users use it for \u2014 whether it\u2019s a civilian navigating their way to the grocery store or a government using it to coordinate their rocket launches \u2014 those are all things that China can track,\u201d said Ms. Moriuchi, of the research group Recorded Future. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what is most striking: that this authoritarian government will be a major technology provider for numerous countries in Asia, Africa and Europe.\u201d\nFor the Pentagon, China\u2019s satellite launches are ominous.\nChina\u2019s military \u201ccontinues to strengthen its military space capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of space,\u201d including developing Beidou and new weaponry, according to a Pentagon report issued to Congress in May.\nIn October, Pakistan\u2019s information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said that by 2022, Pakistan would send its own astronaut into space with China\u2019s help.\n\u201cWe are close to China, and we are getting more close,\u201d he said in a later interview. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the West to wake up and recognize our importance.\u201d\nWooing Pakistan\u2019s Military\nThough the relationship between China and Pakistan has clearly grown closer, it has not been without tension. CPEC could still be vulnerable to political shifts in Pakistan \u2014 as happened this year in Malaysia, which shelved three big projects by Chinese companies.\nCampaigning during the parliamentary elections that made him prime minister in July, Imran Khan vowed to review CPEC projects and renegotiate them if he won. In September, after meeting in Saudi Arabia with the crown prince, Mr. Khan said that the kingdom had agreed to invest in CPEC too.\nPakistan\u2019s new commerce minister then proposed pausing all CPEC projects while the government assessed them.\nThe moves by Pakistan\u2019s new government angered Beijing, which was concerned they could set back Belt and Road globally.\nBut in Pakistan, China has a steady ally it can approach to smooth things over: the country\u2019s powerful military establishment, which stands to fill its coffers with millions of dollars through CPEC as the military\u2019s construction companies win infrastructure bids.\nShortly after the commerce minister\u2019s comments, the Pakistani Army\u2019s top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, hurried to Beijing for an unannounced visit with President Xi Jinping. The meeting came six weeks before Mr. Khan made his first official visit with the Chinese president, a trip he had listed as a priority.\nStatements from the military said General Bajwa and Mr. Xi spoke extensively about Belt and Road projects.\nGeneral Bajwa \u201csaid that the Belt and Road initiative with CPEC as its flagship is destined to succeed despite all odds, and Pakistan\u2019s army shall ensure security of CPEC at all costs,\u201d read a statement from the Pakistani military.\nShortly after the Beijing meeting, Pakistan\u2019s government rolled back its invitation to Saudi Arabia to join CPEC and all talk of pausing or canceling Chinese projects has stopped.\nBut China could face another challenge to its investments: a Pakistani financial crisis that has forced Mr. Khan\u2019s government to seek loans from international lenders that require transparency.\nThroughout September, international delegations traveled to Islamabad carrying the same message: Reveal the extent of Chinese loans if you want financial assistance.\nIn a late September meeting with visiting officials from the International Monetary Fund, Pakistan\u2019s government asked for a bailout of up to $12 billion. The fund\u2019s representatives pressed Pakistan to share all existing agreements with the Chinese government and demanded I.M.F. input during any future CPEC negotiations \u2014 a previously undisclosed facet of the negotiations, according to communications seen by the Fund and a Pakistani official. The fund also sought assurances that Pakistan would not use a bailout to repay CPEC loans.\nBut the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad stepped up its engagement as well, demanding that CPEC deals be kept secret and promising to shore up Pakistan\u2019s finances with bilateral loans, Pakistani officials say.\nThree months after taking office, Mr. Khan still has not made good on his campaign promises to reveal the nature of the $62 billion investment Beijing has committed to Pakistan, and his government has backtracked on an I.M.F. deal.\nIn early November, Mr. Khan visited Mr. Xi in Beijing, a trip during which he was expected to clinch bilateral loans and grants to ease Pakistan\u2019s financial crisis.\nInstead, his government walked away with vague promises of a deal \u201cin principle,\u201d but refused to disclose any details.\nLuz Ding contributed reporting from Beijing.\nAdvertisement", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Last week the N.F.L. insisted that it would not pay for video evidence of player involvement in off-field incidents.\nThe newest video appears to show Nicholson, 23, throw one man to the ground and punch another man several times, including a hit that seems to render the man unconscious as he falls to the ground. TMZ published the video a day after Nicholson was accused of assault and arrested by sheriffs in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nHe was later released after posting a $2,500 bond.\nAccording to the sheriff\u2019s daily crime report, the incident happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday in Ashburn, Virginia. The Loudon County Sheriff\u2019s Office said that Nicholson assaulted a man while a woman he was with struck another woman with a bottle. One of the victims said Nicholson and the woman pulled up in a car and honked the horn. An argument followed, then punches were thrown.\nNicholson was charged with assault and battery, and public drunkenness, while the woman was charged with malicious wounding and assault and battery.\nThe victims, unnamed in the report, were taken to a hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries.\nOn Tuesday, league and Washington officials said they were looking into the incident. Washington later moved Nicholson, a second-year player out of Michigan State, to the reserve/non-football injury list, ruling him out of the next two games and thus ending his season.\nThe investigation may speed up now that video of the fight, which looks like it was taken with a cellphone camera, has been made public. It was only last month, after TMZ published video of former Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt shoving and kicking a woman in a Cleveland hotel lobby, that the league chose to suspend Hunt.\nThe league said it tried unsuccessfully to obtain surveillance video of the incident involving Hunt, which raised questions about whether the N.F.L. was taking investigations into player off-field behavior seriously enough. The league insists that paying for video would lead to bidding wars, and prompt people to use their cellphones to film players in hopes of selling the recording.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It survived World War II, when it served as a base for R.A.F. night fighters flying missions against Nazi Germany. It has just been brought to a standstill by the humble drone.\n\u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened anywhere in the world before,\u201d said Richard Gill, the founder and chief executive of Drone Defence, which helps institutions guard their perimeters against drones.\nThe Gatwick shutdown scrambled hundreds of flights, stranded tens of thousands of passengers and reduced the British government to playing cat-and-mouse with the drones. Controlled, perhaps, by little more than an iPad, they were repeatedly sent over the runway of the country\u2019s second-largest airport in what officials called a \u201cdeliberate act.\u201d\nOn Thursday, about 20 police units searched the perimeter of the airfield for the drones\u2019 operators. By nightfall, the government said it would deploy the military in a bid to reopen the airport, though it was not clear what its role would be.\nPolice sharpshooters were spotted at Gatwick, though officials at one point had precluded that option, citing the risk of a stray bullet hitting someone.\nThe airport finally reopened around 6 a.m. on Friday, more than 24 hours after a drone was first sighted, and the Gatwick website warned passengers who were hoping to travel that flights would still be subject to delays and cancellations.\nThe episode was proving not only a humiliation for aviation officials but also the starkest evidence to date of how vulnerable airports across the world are to the readily available flying devices.\n\u201cOver 90 percent of airports in the world are unprepared for drones,\u201d said Tim Bean, the founder and chief executive of Fortem Technologies, which is testing a drone defense system on several American runways. \u201cAirports, stadiums, borders, oil and gas refineries \u2014 they spend a lot of money on ground security, but I think they now need to think about their airspace security.\u201d\nAs hobbyists and malfeasants alike turn neighborhood parks into airports, the newly democratized skies are becoming increasingly crowded.\nThe number of aircraft scares involving drones recorded by the British government has shot up to more than 100 this year; there were none in 2013. In Mexico and Canada, planes recently survived collisions with what appeared to be drones.\nThe authorities have so far released little information about the type of drones that were buzzing Gatwick, though airport officials said they captured surveillance footage of them. \u201cAs yet, the drone has not been identified,\u201d the Sussex Police said in a statement.\nAirport staff members first spotted a pair of drones flying over the perimeter fence and into the runway area around 9 p.m. Wednesday.\nOfficials shut the runway, then reopened it around 3 a.m. on Thursday before closing it again about 45 minutes later when there was another sighting. Yet another drone was spotted late Thursday morning, and people kept spotting drones through Thursday night. In all, the police said there were 50 reports of drone sightings, though some were duplicates or unconfirmed.\nPolice officials said there were \u201cno indications to suggest this is terror related.\u201d\nAt least 800 flights were canceled, disrupting traffic throughout Europe and affecting upward of 100,000 passengers. Arriving flights carrying 10,000 passengers were diverted, with some travelers forced to land at airports as far away as Paris.\nThe shutdown created bedlam at the south terminal of Gatwick, which is about 25 miles south of central London and is regularly rated Europe\u2019s worst airport and one of the worst in the world. Long lines of weary passengers stretched from the check-in counters to the arrivals area of an adjacent building.\nPassengers slumped over their luggage, refreshing their smartphone screens every few minutes for updates. Others sat staring into space, looking utterly defeated.\n\u201cWho around here can give me some information?\u201d Gary Hornby, 47, shouted after cursing at an airport staff member.\n\u201cWhen the hell are we getting out of here?\u201d he went on, kicking his suitcase.\nSome passengers were baffled at how poorly prepared the airport seemed.\n\u201cThis is a huge security risk,\u201d said Alison Carter, 44, a teacher of German. \u201cHow does the airport not have the resources to down the drone? What kind of message does this give to terrorists and criminals?\u201d\nTechnology companies have invented several drone defense systems, but they are relatively new, and airports and government officials are still weighing which to invest in. One system that was recently deployed to stop drug smuggling at an English prison acts as an electronic fence, blocking radio signals around a prison whenever drones are detected.\nMr. Gill, the founder of Drone Defence \u2014 which made the electronic fence \u2014 said that airports were technologically complex landscapes and that officials were studying all the available options. He said the mishap at Gatwick would concentrate people\u2019s minds on the potential dangers.\nThe system developed by Fortem Technologies uses a sophisticated radar system to detect intruder drones, and then sends a drone hunter to pluck them out of the sky, dog-fighting with them, if necessary. The system is already being used to monitor two runways at Salt Lake City International Airport and others, he said.\nBut, Mr. Bean said, as airports focus on building tools to intercept drones that emit radio frequency signals, they are finding that drones have evolved far beyond that technology. That renders many of the current security systems obsolete.\nBritish laws make it illegal to fly a drone within a kilometer \u2014 about three-fifths of a mile \u2014 of airport boundaries. Violators are subject to five years in prison.\nAnd as of next Nov. 30, owners of drones weighing more than 250 grams, or a bit more than half a pound, will have to register them with the Civil Aviation Authority, and those who fly them will have to pass an online safety test. Not following these steps could result in fines of as much as $1,270.\nAirports have been shut down before over drone sightings \u2014 including Gatwick, which was closed after sightings in July 2017. Airports in Chengdu, China; Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; and Ottawa have also had to shut down.\nMany drones have internal GPS software that prevents pilots from flying them into restricted areas like airports. But Ulrike Franke, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations who specializes in drones, said the systems were imperfect and could be subverted by people who understood their workings.\nAnd they can do a lot of damage.\n\u201cThe danger is pretty much the same as with birds: A drone may get caught in an engine during takeoff and landing,\u201d Ms. Franke said. \u201cIt\u2019s plastic, metal and lithium batteries that can explode.\u201d\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated when certain drone owners must begin registering and passing a safety test. The date is Nov. 30, 2019, not this past Nov. 30.\nHow we handle corrections\nAdam Satariano and Ceylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from London, and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Another suspect arrested on Tuesday was thought to have extremist ties, Moroccan prosecutors told local news outlets without providing further details. The names of those arrested were not immediately released.\nThe authorities said that the bodies of the victims, Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway, were found on Monday by other tourists in an isolated area of the High Atlas Mountains, an area popular with hikers and six miles from the village of Imlil. Both women had been studying at the same school in Norway to become tour guides.\nPrime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen of Denmark said on Thursday that the killings might be \u201cpolitically motivated, and thereby an act of terror.\u201d He added that \u201cthere are still dark forces that want to fight our values\u201d and that \u201cwe must not give in.\u201d\n\u201cWhat should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. He vowed to do everything possible to solve the crime.\nA video posted on social media purported to show one of the victims screaming while a man cut her neck with a knife. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said it was working to authenticate the video.\nIn the statement, the intelligence service said it was an \u201cunusually gruesome\u201d case: \u201cThe video and preliminary investigation according to the Moroccan authorities indicate that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization Islamic State.\u201d\nNorway\u2019s National Criminal Investigation Service, the special unit of the Norwegian police known as Kripos, said it was trying to have the video removed from websites, according to local news reports.\nThe affiliation of the suspects was unclear, but the four had recorded a video a week before the killings, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, according to Morocco\u2019s general prosecutor.\nThe video, which was shared on Twitter, showed the men vowing fealty to the group\u2019s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and saying that they \u201ccannot remain seated, witnessing the destruction caused by Crusader planes,\u201d terminology typically used by the group to refer to Western airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.\nPrime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway called the killings \u201ca senseless attack,\u201d adding that the case \u201cemphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.\u201d She said that Norway would assist the Moroccan authorities in their investigation.\nThe deaths have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. But the country has battled Islamic extremism for years, and thousands of Moroccans have joined the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The last terrorist attack happened in Marrakesh in 2011, when a bomb attack in a cafe killed 17 people, including 11 Europeans.\nThe foreign ministries in Norway and Demark issued travel advisories on Thursday warning their citizens to exercise extreme caution when visiting Morocco.\nAbdellah Rami, a Moroccan expert on Islamist movements, said that if the terrorism link were to be verified, it would be the first terrorist attack outside Morocco\u2019s urban areas.\n\u201cThe ideological identity is clear, but the organization they\u2019re affiliated to isn\u2019t,\u201d he said on Thursday of the suspects. \u201cSo the question is, did they commit this independently or was it a sleeper cell?\u201d\nHe noted that the attack \u201ctargets very sensitive matters like tourism, which is an essential component of the Moroccan economy.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is hard for the authorities to protect these areas and easier for organizations like ISIS to start operating in these places.\u201d\nMs. Ueland\u2019s mother, Irene Ueland, was quoted in a regional newspaper as describing the killings as \u201cpure madness.\u201d\nMs. Jespersen wrote a post on Nov. 21 on Facebook about her coming trip: \u201cDear friends, I\u2019m going to Morocco in December. Any of you guys who\u2019s around by then or any mountain friends who knows something about Mount Toubkal?\u201d\nThe site where the bodies were found is often the starting point for treks to Mount Toubkal, North Africa\u2019s highest peak.\nMs. Jespersen\u2019s family told Danish news media that she had traveled to Morocco on Dec. 8 to celebrate Christmas and to practice climbing with her Norwegian friend. Since the age of 18, her relatives said, she had a habit of traveling for the holiday.\nOn their last phone call before the trip, Ms. Jespersen told her mother, Helle Jespersen, who lives in Grindsted, west of Copenhagen, that she was excited and busy with exams at the Norwegian school where she was studying to become a tour guide.\n\u201cShe was always happy and positive,\u201d he mother said in interviews with Danish news outlets. \u201cEverybody got along with her and she made everybody their best.\u201d She added, \u201cYou would have to prove it to her if she was to believe in evil.\u201d\nAccording to Moroccan news reports, investigators recovered surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims\u2019 tent and leaving the area after their deaths.\nMartin Selsoe Sorensen reported from Copenhagen, and Aida Alami from Paris.

They went breezing by, lightheartedly addressing large ideas while alluding to decades of R&B and hip-hop. Her music was often skeletal \u2014 a handful of looped instruments \u2014 but most of the songs sounded complete, not truncated.\nIt was a miniature tour de force, and enough to get Whack noticed by the Grammys (which, with typical befuddlement, nominated an earlier, more conventional track, \u201cMumbo Jumbo,\u201d for best music video). In its deceptively casual ambition and ruthless brevity, \u201cWhack World\u201d had a brilliant strategy for combat in the attention economy: keep things short and visual.\nBecause, really, who has time for music?\nListeners have work, or school, or both, and work in the internet era has grown infinitely expandable past 9 to 5. Because so much music now arrives via streaming, controlled on a screen, music also has to share attention with everything else on that screen: texts, social media, videos, alerts, news feeds, games, searches, maps, maybe one more check on that work email. Perhaps some single-minded listeners can set all those distractions aside, but they\u2019re a minority.\n[Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.]\nMusicians face countless distractions of their own. The internet shattered the old album cycle of studio seclusion (for audio recording, and then for audio plus video) followed by promotion and touring. That prospect seemed freeing at first, since music could appear when inspiration struck, in any grouping or length.\nAlong came the unintended consequences. Without the routine expectation of, say, a 12-song album every two or three years, the internet looms as a giant, insatiable maw, constantly demanding more content with less payback. YouTube and streaming have made each song a click rather than a purchase \u2014 and not even a click with autoplay, prefab playlists and algorithmic \u201cdiscovery\u201d (which actually pushes toward more of the same niche) guiding the way. In that endless stream, the idea that a song is a thought-out, carefully distilled utterance was bound to erode.\nAdd another factor: social media. The initial promise was increased connectivity, a way to reach and respond to fans quickly and candidly: no gatekeepers, no filters. But for most pop aspirants, the result has been the end of creative seclusion. There\u2019s pressure to keep offering new material, musical and nonmusical, making the promotional cycle as endless as the internet workday. Maybe it\u2019s a song snippet or a glimpse of a video shoot. Or maybe it\u2019s a Twitter feud, a media-ready screed on Facebook or a fashion experiment on Instagram.\nAs marketing, it\u2019s relatively low-budget \u2014 and democratizing \u2014 but the potential for distraction is boundless. Billie Eilish, a 17-year-old songwriter who has been releasing ominously compelling songs about desire and intimate betrayal since 2016, tabulates 24 million listeners monthly on Spotify and tours internationally as a headliner. But she will be just getting around to releasing her debut album in 2019. In the meantime, she gathers about two million likes each time she posts a pouty photo on Instagram. Musicians aren\u2019t exempt from the gamified, instant-gratification metrics that keep users on social media, and the narcissism that often goes with being a performer might make them even more susceptible.\nTechnology and distribution mechanisms \u2014 the guitar, the microphone, the LP, radio \u2014 have always shaped music. Now, social media and streaming are rewarding a rapidly changing skill set. It\u2019s a different kind of career that makes music just one part of a pool of cultural content: aural, visual, textual, entrepreneurial. That model grew out of hip-hop. But in the social media age, the career path is different. Cardi B was a stripper turned sassy social-media figure who made her public pivot into hip-hop on a reality-TV series. She has been rapidly and diligently improving her singing, rapping and writing, but at the same time, she has kept her snappy social-media presence in full force. Together they multiply her cultural leverage; the impact is more important than the means.\nPop celebrity has always demanded a certain amount of spectacle, from magazine photo sessions to video clips. But now, social media is pushing that spectacle to become continuous, intimate and hyperactive on multiple fronts. Performers gather shards of attention into a multimedia mosaic that\u2019s presented like a soap opera coupled with a surveillance log: evidence of authenticity that can turn forensic. Daniel Hernandez, the rapper known as 6ix9ine, flaunted a gun-toting tough-guy image in raps and on social media \u2014 he has nearly 16 million Instagram followers \u2014 but has ended up charged with real-world gang activities, with prosecutors citing his social-media postings.\nFor the 21st-century pop figure, songs are part of the mix, but so are romances and breakups, professional rivalries and reconciliations and countless rumors and memes that might be generated by the stars themselves, their fans or their trolls. Which in turn feed back into the next round of songs.\nAriana Grande\u2019s 2018 album, \u201cSweetener,\u201d exulted in a blissful, erotic romance, including a track, \u201cPete Davidson,\u201d named after her boyfriend. Soon after they broke up came a self-healing single, \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d that listed exes\u2019 names and promised that she was now in love with herself. Its video clip, with more than 200 million YouTube views, mocked social-media misinformation. It\u2019s a full-fledged, old-school pop song, complete with song-and-dance video extravaganza, but it\u2019s also the latest episode in her continuing personal saga.\nPerhaps, in a culture that\u2019s constantly staring at a small screen, music was bound to be pushed aside. Songs that become massive streaming hits often sound unfinished, a looped riff and a vocal with a few tweaks. They fit into playlists that go by unobtrusively as background music; they are the ticktock of a soundtrack to everyday life. But songs can also have a higher profile. They can astound us with timbres never heard before and rhythms that kick and shake; they can tell us things we weren\u2019t sure we knew.\nAnd there is an audience for them. As the perceived value of recorded music has dropped nearly to zero, people have been willing to pay more and more each year for live concerts \u2014 where the music is the main thing in the room, where distractions are minimized. According to figures from the concert-promotion magazine Pollstar, for the top 100 tours of 2018 alone, gross revenues worldwide were $5.6 billion and average ticket prices rose from $84.63 in 2017 to $93.65 this year. In North America, the leap was even greater, from $78.91 to $92.50. Music can still be a central, overwhelming experience.

One was led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Sierra Leone\u2019s Njala University, and the second by the University of California, Davis, and Sierra Leone\u2019s University of Makeni.\nEgyptian rousette fruit bats are known to harbor the virus elsewhere in Africa, \u201cso it\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019d find the virus in bats there\u201d in West Africa, said Jonathan S. Towner, an ecological diseases specialist who led the C.D.C. team.\nThe testing was done as part of a relatively new American-led effort to spot dangerous pathogens lurking in animals and take steps to prevent them from crossing over into humans and triggering lethal outbreaks.\nKnown as Predict, it is paid for by the United States Agency for International Development.\nDiscoveries like the one in Sierra Leone are \u201cexactly what Predict\u2019s \u2018one health\u2019 approach to disease surveillance and capacity building are designed to do,\u201d said Dr. Brian Bird, leader of the U.C. Davis team.\nA \u201cone health\u201d approach means uniting the work of medical doctors and veterinarians \u2014 and occasionally plant biologists \u2014 to search for threats to humans that lurk in other species.\nPredict projects also train local scientists to carry on the work after its teams move on.\nEgyptian fruit bats \u2014 also called \u201cflying foxes,\u201d because of their dog-like faces \u2014 are found as far south as South Africa and as far east as Pakistan and northern India. They are not migratory, but it is not known how far individuals or groups normally range.\nGenetic testing found multiple strains of the virus in each bat, suggesting it had circulated in West African colonies for many years.\nThere have been no known human Marburg outbreaks in West Africa, but the potential for one exists.\nFrom 2013 to 2016, West Africa endured the biggest Ebola outbreak in history, which killed more than 11,000 people. The first patient was thought to have been a child who often played in a bat-infested tree.\nThe virus was named for the German city where it was first detected in 1967, nine years before the discovery of Ebola. A mysterious disease that included hemorrhagic fevers struck workers at a vaccine factory who had handled a shipment of green monkeys from Uganda. The virus also infected people in Frankfurt and Belgrade; 31 people fell ill, and seven died.\nThe bats are about six inches long with wings two feet wide; they roost in caves or in the deep forest, and come out at night to eat fruit \u2014 a habit that leads fruit farmers to poison large numbers of them.\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\nThe bats shed the virus in their feces, urine and saliva. Scientists believe animals, including monkeys, may pick up Marburg virus by eating fruit that bats have gnawed.\nHumans may get it from being bitten when they capture bats to eat, from cuts during food preparation or from infectious bat guano. Most human outbreaks have begun in people who visited bat-infested caves or mines.\nThe largest known outbreak of Marburg virus, which began in Angola in 2004, sickened over 250 people and had a 90 percent fatality rate. Two of the strains found in Sierra Leone bats were similar to the Angolan ones.\nDonald G. McNeil Jr. is a science reporter covering epidemics and diseases of the world\u2019s poor.

He loved decorating trees, singing songs like \u201cSilent Night\u201d and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.\nBut in early December, the police shut down Mr. Gu\u2019s usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu, as part of what activists say is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated Bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain\u2019s outspoken pastor on charges of \u201cinciting subversion,\u201d punishable in serious cases by at least five years in prison.\nOn Christmas Eve, Mr. Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend\u2019s home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Mr. Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.\n\u201cWe will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,\u201d Mr. Gu said.\nAs millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.\nMr. Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party\u2019s dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party\u2019s control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.\nThe campaign comes as Mr. Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.\nRUSSIA\nMONGOLIA\nXINJIANG\nBeijing\nCHINA\nChengdu\nSICHUAN\nGuangzhou\nINDIA\nMYANMAR\n500 Miles\nRenee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the \u201cheart of the underground Christian resistance.\u201d The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party\u2019s grip on society.\n\u201cThe message,\u201d Ms. Xia said, \u201cis that Xi can\u2019t be messed with.\u201d\nThe crackdown escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshipers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closing of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.\nThe government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.\nMany in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China\u2019s fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China\u2019s authoritarian government and Mr. Xi\u2019s embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.\nBut the government\u2019s heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.\nOn Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain\u2019s former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.\nLi Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. \u201cWe have moved underground,\u201d he said.\nMembers have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church\u2019s former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.\nMr. Wang, in a prewritten message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.\n\u201cThe Communist regime\u2019s persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.\u201d\nMr. Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled \u201cThe God Who Bestows Peace.\u201d Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.\nAt Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.\nA children\u2019s choir sang \u201cSilent Night,\u201d and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.\nThe anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.\n\u201cIf you see the police, national security or community workers, greet them with gentleness,\u201d Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. \u201cIf they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.\u201d\nWhile he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Mr. Wen asked those in attendance to remember \u201cthose who are criminally detained.\u201d Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.\nSince Mr. Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches from 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.\nThis year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d plays in the background at malls.\nOfficials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.\n\u201cChina\u2019s Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.\nBut China\u2019s growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.\nOne notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.\nDespite Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to expand the officially atheist party\u2019s control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing.\nWhile official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshiping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.\nIndependent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.\nWhile sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.\nEarly Rain, which Mr. Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Mr. Wang called Mr. Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations around Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.\nMr. Gu, the rice seller, began attending services two years ago after finding videos of Mr. Wang\u2019s fiery sermons online. He felt Mr. Wang\u2019s concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Mr. Gu was baptized last year.\n\u201cI saw injustices in society,\u201d Mr. Gu said. \u201cI saw that the government\u2019s promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.\u201d\nWorried for his own safety, Mr. Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.\nMr. Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: \u201cThe path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.\u201d\nFollow Javier C.

For This Reporter, Too.\nWhen the investigative journalist Matt Apuzzo moved from Washington to Brussels, he noticed that distrust had a different focus. And he adjusted some of his own tech tools.\nHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Matt Apuzzo, an investigative correspondent in Brussels, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nWhat are the most important tech tools for you as an investigative journalist?\nAs with most people these days, my go-to device is my phone, which in my case is an iPhone X. I don\u2019t use it for anything particularly unique to journalism, except maybe document scanning. Sometimes, I might have only a minute to see a key document, and having it can mean the difference between breaking a story and not. For years I have used an app called TurboScan Pro, and I love it.\nTech is great, but there\u2019s no substitute for personal relationships. I prefer face-to-face conversations whenever possible, and I almost never record them. I use small, discreet notebooks like the Moleskine pocket journal. A lot of my interviews are over coffee, drinks or meals, and I want something as unobtrusive as possible at the table. I love the feel of the Rhodia pocket webnotebook, but let\u2019s be honest: I\u2019m not picky. Some of the best, most surprising nuggets of information have been scribbled on napkins or the backs of envelopes or tapped in text messages to myself.\nI try to transcribe long interviews immediately. I have been a longtime devotee of the web-based app Workflowy for taking notes, at the recommendation of my colleague Farhad Manjoo. It\u2019s particularly great for long-term projects and collaborations. I recently downloaded and am trying out the app Bear at the recommendation of another colleague, Kate Conger. My dream piece of note-taking software has a lightweight, fast interface that supports tagging and annotation of PDFs. I\u2019ve tried Evernote and OneNote but found both to be too bloated for my purposes. The quest continues.\nI use a MacBook Pro, which I like for its full-disk encryption. But it devours battery life. Maybe it\u2019s just my device, but it loses 50 percent of its charge while sleeping overnight, and Apple says there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. So I followed the lead of another colleague, Eric Lipton, and invested in a power pack that can recharge both my Mac and my phone. I picked a unit from ZDI because Wirecutter recommended it, and I\u2019m quite happy with it.\nWhen I travel, it all gets tossed into an Everyday Max Backpack, which opens and packs like a roll aboard but carries like a slim backpack and includes a separate laptop compartment. All the cables are kept in check with the Grid-It organization system.\nHow do you keep communications with sources secure?\nBefore moving to Europe this summer, I spent about a decade covering national security and intelligence in cities like Washington, so I\u2019m pretty security conscious. Before I left, a friend who works in intelligence offered a gentle reminder that most countries would probably consider me fair game for intelligence collection.\nSo I use a cheap Chromebook when traveling to places where curious eyes might be tempted to sneak a peek. I set it up with a burner account, and I never connect it to any personal or business accounts.\nAnd all those note-taking apps? If I\u2019m working on something particularly sensitive or talking to someone who is sticking his neck out by meeting with me, those notes often don\u2019t get saved digitally. When the story is done, the notebook gets tossed and that\u2019s the end of it.\nFor my phone, I appreciate Apple\u2019s encryption standards. I don\u2019t appreciate having to turn off all the location-based corporate surveillance on my iPhone, but nothing is perfect.\nFor text-based conversations, I use mostly Signal and WhatsApp. But as President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort reminded us all: End-to-end encryption is useless if you\u2019re backing up chats to the cloud. So I don\u2019t.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest difference you\u2019ve noticed in how Europeans use tech versus Americans?\nThe biggest difference seems to be one of trust. Speaking generally, Europeans seem far more suspicious of private companies and far more trusting of their governments. Americans don\u2019t trust the government with their data, but will click \u201cO.K.\u201d to allow companies to mine their personal lives and sell their information to any number of unsavory buyers. Again this is a generalization, but the idea that companies can secretly use your personal information to manipulate you seems much more unsettling to Europeans than the knowledge that the government is tracking subway rides and videotaping city streets.\nAnd tech-savvy countries like Estonia are innovating in ways that make government more efficient. When you see Estonia\u2019s \u201conly once\u201d policy \u2014 the promise that you\u2019ll never have to give the government a piece of information more than once \u2014 it\u2019s hard not to view the United States and all of its paper as slow and outdated. Age, sex, address, date of birth, employer, phone number: How many times have you scratched them on a piece of paper for a different bureaucrat in a different office in a different wing of the American bureaucracy?\nWhat are the most important tech tools now for you and your family in keeping touch with folks back home?\nThe move has been pretty seamless, techwise. I\u2019m on WhatsApp with my family and friends and Signal with my colleagues, just as before. I ported my Washington cell number to Tossable Digits, a service that forwards calls to my Brussels number and forwards text messages to my email address. It\u2019s nice to keep an American number handy.\nYou won\u2019t find me on Facebook. I pulled the plug and don\u2019t miss it at all.\nAnd I\u2019m almost three years clean on Twitter, which was a much harder break. But I noticed it was really hurting my attention span. Plus, it just felt like an endless version of the worst kind of cocktail party. Only with Nazis. So many Nazis. I\u2019m still there as @mattapuzzo, though, because a colleague told me that if I deleted the account it would be taken over by sex bots.\nAnd nobody wants that.\nMatt Apuzzo is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter based in Washington.

In a blaze of propaganda, the police accused him and other combative attorneys of disrupting trials, fanning discontent, and plotting to overthrow the Communist Party.\nBut while others detained in the crackdown were released with warnings, put on bail after making rehearsed confessions on television, or tried and sentenced, Mr. Wang remained held in secrecy. His trial was also swaddled in security to ward off protests.\n\u201cThis whole process has been illegal, so how could I expect an open and fair trial?\u201d Mr. Wang\u2019s wife, Li Wenzu, said in a telephone interview before the hearing. \u201cBut my demand is still that he be freed as not guilty, because that\u2019s what he is.\u201d\nThe police and guards kept Ms. Li from leaving her apartment in Beijing to attend the trial in Tianjin, a port city about 65 miles southeast from her home in the capital. During Mr. Wang\u2019s detention, the authorities rejected repeated attempts by her and a succession of attorneys to visit him or find out more about his status and health.\nThe mobile phone of Liu Weiguo, the lawyer who represented Mr. Wang at the trial was turned off on Wednesday evening, and it was unclear when the trial ended. But the Tianjin Second Intermediate People\u2019s Court that heard the case said on its website that a verdict would be announced at a later date. \u201cBecause state secrets were involved, the court decided under the law not to hold a public trial,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cThis will be a show trial, carefully censored and tightly controlled,\u201d said Terence Halliday, a research professor at the American Bar Foundation in Chicago who studies Chinese defense lawyers. \u201cThrough Wang Quanzhang\u2019s protracted disappearance, China\u2019s state security and public security have been sending a chilling message to activist lawyers \u2014 keep silent or this could be your fate too.\u201d\nStill, one detail slipped out from the secret proceedings that suggested Mr. Wang remained unbowed. While in the courtroom, he dismissed his lawyer, Mr. Liu, who was not chosen by his family, Ms. Li said, citing a message from Mr. Liu. That step may have forced an adjournment in the trial, but Ms. Li had no further details.\nMr. Wang\u2019s case, though, has been overshadowed this year by other controversies in China as Xi Jinping, the party leader and president, has sought to extinguish potential threats to party rule.\nHundreds of thousands of Muslims in Xinjiang, a northwest region, have been detained in indoctrination camps where they are forced to renounce their religious beliefs and pledge loyalty to the party. Several independent Protestant churches have been shut down, and an outspoken pastor of one was detained. Two Canadians have been detained and accused of threatening national security in what supporters say was reprisal for a Chinese telecommunications executive\u2019s arrest in Canada.\nThe detentions of lawyers and advocates in 2015 were a turning point on the way to more hard-line policies, said experts and friends of Mr. Wang. His prolonged detention came to symbolize the Communist Party\u2019s growing readiness to override promised legal protections if they got in the way of silencing perceived threats, they said.\n\u201cThe mass detention and surveillance campaign and other persecution in Xinjiang are the worst examples we know of at the moment, but they are connected to what is going on more widely in China,\u201d said Eva Pils, a professor of law at King\u2019s College London who studies China\u2019s human rights lawyers and knows Mr. Wang. \u201cHuman rights defenders are very openly characterized as enemies of the people, connected to other, outside enemies.\u201d\nIn the face of official pressure and rebuffs, Ms. Li and the families of other detained lawyers coalesced into a determined and creative resistance.\nThey have protested using red buckets, attempted walking to the detention center where Mr. Wang was held, and this month they shaved their heads to protest what they said was judges\u2019 failure to enforce Mr. Wang\u2019s rights under Chinese law. (The Mandarin Chinese word for hair (fa) sounds similar to the word for law.)\n\u201cIn Chinese, having no hair sounds like having no law,\u201d Ms. Li said. \u201cWe meant that we can do without our hair, but we can\u2019t do without law.\u201d\nThe prosecutors\u2019 allegations against Mr. Wang appeared to distill several themes that the government has used to attack China\u2019s human rights lawyers as a whole.\nThey accused him of \u201cstirring up trouble\u201d by calling together lawyers and supporters to demand that detainees be freed; of maligning China\u2019s legal system online while representing members of a banned spiritual movement, Falun Gong; and colluding with a foreign-funded group to \u201cpropagate methods and tricks for resisting the government,\u201d according to a 2017 prosecutors\u2019 document shared by Peter Dahlin, a Swedish rights advocate named in the allegations.\nMr. Dahlin, who was detained in Beijing for 23 days in 2016 and deported from China for his work helping rights activists, said he was sure the document was authentic and rejected the claim that Mr. Wang\u2019s activities amounted to \u201csubversion of state power.\u201d\nMr. Wang was born in Shandong Province, east China, and was drawn to activism even before he had graduated from law school. Like many other Chinese attorneys who take on contentious cases, his clients were mostly ordinary citizens in disputes with officials over land seizures, detentions and police abuses.\nEven more than most rights lawyers, he has a stubborn streak, his wife and friends said.\nHis unbending personality probably \u201ckept him going through years of abusive, incommunicado detention and given him the strength to refuse a forced confession,\u201d Michael Caster, a human rights advocate who formerly worked in Beijing with Mr. Wang, said by email. \u201cHe was never one to be intimidated by threats from judges or by the physical abuse of police.\u201d\nWhen asked about Mr. Wang and others detained in the 2015 crackdown, Chinese officials have said that they have been given all their legal rights. But legal experts have said that his long, secretive confinement and lack of access to his own lawyers flouted China\u2019s laws. In October, a United Nations Human Rights Council group condemned the secretive detention of Mr. Wang and two other Chinese advocates as a violation of international laws.\nChinese courts come under the guidance of the Communist Party and rarely, if ever, find defendants innocent in politically charged cases. Some of his supporters said Mr. Wang could be given a suspended prison sentence like other some lawyers who were detained in 2015.

That ship had enough space on it for everyone who had been aboard the raft. It could have brought them all to the safety of Europe, where they might have had a chance at being granted asylum.\nInstead, 20 people drowned and 47 more were captured by the Libyan Coast Guard, which brought the migrants back to Libya, where they suffered abuse \u2014 including rape and torture.\nThis confrontation at sea was not a simplistic case of Europe versus Africa, with human rights and rescue on one side and chaos and danger on the other. Rather it\u2019s a case of Europe versus Europe: of volunteers struggling to save lives being undercut by European Union policies that outsource border control responsibilities to the Libyan Coast Guard \u2014 with the aim of stemming arrivals on European shores.\nWhile funding, equipping and directing the Libyan Coast Guard, European governments have stymied the activities of nongovernmental organizations like Sea-Watch, criminalizing them or impounding their ships, or turning away from ports ships carrying survivors.\nMore than 14,000 people have died or gone missing while trying to cross the central Mediterranean since 2014. But unlike most of those deaths and drownings, the incident on Nov. 6, 2017, was extensively documented.\nSea-Watch\u2019s ship and rescue rafts were outfitted with nine cameras, documenting the entire scene in video and audio. The Libyans, too, filmed parts of the incident on their mobile phones.\nThe research groups Forensic Architecture and Forensic Oceanography of Goldsmiths, University of London, of which three of us \u2014 Mr. Heller, Mr. Pezzani and Mr. Weizman \u2014 are a part, combined these video sources with radio recordings, vessel tracking data, witness testimonies and newly obtained official sources to produce a minute-by-minute reconstruction of the facts. Opinion Video at The New York Times built on this work to create the above short documentary, gathering further testimonials by some of the survivors and rescuers who were there.\nThis investigation makes a few things clear: European governments are avoiding their legal and moral responsibilities to protect the human rights of people fleeing violence and economic desperation. More worrying, the Libyan Coast Guard partners that Europe is collaborating with are ready to blatantly violate those rights if it allows them to prevent migrants from crossing the sea.\nStopping Migrants, Whatever the Cost\nTo understand the cynicism of Europe\u2019s policies in the Mediterranean, one must understand the legal context. According to a 2012 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, migrants rescued by European civilian or military vessels must be taken to a safe port. Because of the chaotic political situation in Libya and well-documented human rights abuses in detention camps there, that means a European port, often in Italy or Malta.\nBut when the Libyan Coast Guard intercepts migrants, even outside Libyan territorial waters, as it did on Nov. 6, the Libyans take them back to detention camps in Libya, which is not subject to European Court of Human Rights jurisdiction.\nFor Italy \u2014 and Europe \u2014 this is an ideal situation. Europe is able to stop people from reaching its shores while washing its hands of any responsibility for their safety.\nThis policy can be traced back to February 2017, when Italy and the United Nations-supported Libyan Government of National Accord signed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding\u201d that provided a framework for collaboration on development, to fight against \u201cillegal immigration,\u201d human trafficking and the smuggling of contraband. This agreement defines clearly the aim, \u201cto stem the illegal migrants\u2019 flows,\u201d and committed Italy to provide \u201ctechnical and technological support to the Libyan institutions in charge of the fight against illegal immigration.\u201d\nLibyan Coast Guard members have been trained by the European Union, and the Italian government donated or repaired several patrol boats and supported the establishment of a Libyan search-and-rescue zone. Libyan authorities have since attempted \u2014 in defiance of maritime law \u2014 to make that zone off-limits to nongovernmental organizations\u2019 rescue vessels. Italian Navy ships, based in Tripoli, have coordinated Libyan Coast Guard efforts.\nBefore these arrangements, Libyan actors were able to intercept and return very few migrants leaving from Libyan shores. Now the Libyan Coast Guard is an efficient partner, having intercepted some 20,000 people in 2017 alone.\nThe Libyan Coast Guard is efficient when it comes to stopping migrants from reaching Europe. It\u2019s not as good, however, at saving their lives, as the events of Nov. 6 show.\nA Deadly Policy in Action\nThat morning the migrant raft had encountered worsening conditions after leaving Tripoli, Libya, over night. Someone onboard used a satellite phone to call the Italian Coast Guard for help.\nBecause the Italians were required by law to alert nearby vessels of the sinking raft, they alerted Sea-Watch to its approximate location. But they also requested the intervention of their Libyan counterparts.\nThe Libyan Coast Guard vessel that was sent to intervene on that morning, the Ras Jadir, was one of several that had been repaired by Italy and handed back to the Libyans in May of 2017. Eight of the 13 crew members onboard had received training from the European Union anti-smuggling naval program known as Operation Sophia.\nEven so, the Libyans brought the Ras Jadir next to the migrants\u2019 raft, rather than deploying a smaller rescue vessel, as professional rescuers do. This offered no hope of rescuing those who had already fallen overboard and only caused more chaos, during which at least five people died.\nThese deaths were not merely a result of a lack of professionalism. Some of the migrants who had been brought aboard the Ras Jadir were so afraid of their fate at the hands of the Libyans that they jumped back into the water to try to reach the European rescuers. As can be seen in the footage, members of the Libyan Coast Guard beat the remaining migrants.\nSea-Watch\u2019s crew was also attacked by the Libyan Coast Guard, who threatened them and threw hard objects at them to keep them away. This eruption of violence was the result of a clash between the goals of rescue and interception, with the migrants caught in the middle desperately struggling for their lives.\nApart from those who died during this chaos, more than 15 people had already drowned in the time spent waiting for any rescue vessel to appear.\nThere was, however, no shortage of potential rescuers in the area: A Portuguese surveillance plane had located the migrants\u2019 raft after its distress call. An Italian Navy helicopter and a French frigate were nearby and eventually offered some support during the rescue.\nIt\u2019s possible that this French ship, deployed as part of Operation Sophia, could have reached the sinking vessel earlier, in time to save more lives \u2014 despite our requests, this information has not been disclosed to us. But it remained at a distance throughout the incident and while offering some support, notably refrained from taking migrants onboard who would then have had to have been disembarked on European soil. It\u2019s an example of a hands-off approach that seeks to make Libyan intervention not only possible but also inevitable.\nA Legal Challenge\nOn the basis of the forensic reconstruction, the Global Legal Action Network and the Association for Juridical Studies on Immigration, with the support of Yale Law School students, have filed a case against Italy at the European Court of Human Rights representing 17 survivors of this incident.\nThose working on the suit, who include two of us \u2014 Mr. Mann and Ms. Moreno-Lax \u2014 argue that even though Italian or European personnel did not physically intercept the migrants and bring them back to Libya, Italy exercised effective control over the Libyan Coast Guard through mutual agreements, support and on-the-ground coordination. Italy has entrusted the Libyans with a task that Rome knows full well would be illegal if undertaken directly: preventing migrants from seeking protection in Europe by impeding their flight and sending them back to a country where extreme violence and exploitation await.\nWe hope this legal complaint will lead the European court to rule that countries cannot subcontract their legal and humanitarian obligations to dubious partners, and that if they do, they retain responsibility for the resulting violations. Such a precedent would force the entire European Union to make sure its cooperation with partners like Libya does not end up denying refugees the right to seek asylum.\nThis case is especially important right now. In Italy\u2019s elections in March, the far-right Lega party, which campaigned on radical anti-immigrant rhetoric, took nearly 20 percent of the vote. The party is now part of the governing coalition, of which its leader, Matteo Salvini, is the interior minister.\nHis government has doubled down on animosity toward migrants. In June, Italy took the drastic step of turning away a humanitarian vessel from the country\u2019s ports and has been systematically blocking rescued migrants from being disembarked since then, even when they had been assisted by the Italian Coast Guard.\nThe Italian crackdown helps explain why seafarers off the Libyan coast have refrained from assisting migrants in distress, leaving them to drift for days. Under the new Italian government, a new batch of patrol boats has been handed over to the Libyan Coast Guard, and the rate of migrants being intercepted and brought back to Libya has increased. All this has made the crossing even more dangerous than before.\nItaly has been seeking to enact a practice that blatantly violates the spirit of the Geneva Convention on refugees, which enshrines the right to seek asylum and prohibits sending people back to countries in which their lives are at risk. A judgment by the European Court sanctioning Italy for this practice would help prevent the outsourcing of border control and human rights violations that may prevent the world\u2019s most disempowered populations from seeking protection and dignity.\nThe European Court of Human Rights cannot stand alone as a guardian of fundamental rights. Yet an insistence on its part to uphold the law would both reflect and bolster the movements seeking solidarity with migrants across Europe.\nCharles Heller and Lorenzo Pezzani are co-founders of Forensic Oceanography, and Eyal Weizman is the director of Forensic Architecture, at Goldsmiths, University of London.

May, Early Advocate of Internet Privacy, Dies at 66\nTimothy C. May, a physicist, polemicist and cantankerous advocate of internet privacy who helped start a movement aimed at protecting the privacy of individuals online, died on Dec. 13 at his home in Corralitos, Calif. He was 66.\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff-Coroner\u2019s office confirmed his death but said that the cause had not yet been determined.\nAs the rabble-rousing leader of a group called the Cypherpunks, Mr. May, in his writings, foreshadowed and influenced many of the concerns about privacy and government control that have come to dominate the internet age.\nIn the one-page Crypto Anarchist Manifesto, which he wrote in 1988, Mr. May said, \u201cJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.\u201d\nMuch of Mr. May\u2019s writing, incorporating elements of advanced math, libertarian politics and even science fiction, was circulated by the Cypherpunks, a group he co-founded with John Gilmore and Eric Hughes in 1992. It inspired later online movements like WikiLeaks and cryptocurrency technologies like Bitcoin.\nIn recent years, Mr. May\u2019s legacy had been clouded by his frequent and unapologetically offensive statements in online forums. In 2003 he wrote that he would welcome a nuclear strike on Washington because it would kill \u201ca million criminal politicians and two million inner-city welfare mutants.\u201d\nHis friends said that his troublesome views were an outgrowth of the style that had made him so influential.\n\u201cHe would try to get people\u2019s attention by saying things in a deliberately confrontational way,\u201d said Mr. Gilmore, who later co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group.\nOnce he got someone\u2019s attention, Mr. May was interested in having an honest conversation, Mr. Gilmore said. \u201cHe actually cared about the truth and about coming to understand things,\u201d he said.\nTimothy Christopher May was born on Dec. 21, 1951, in Bethesda, Md. His father, Thomas, was in the Navy, and the family moved frequently, to California, Virginia and France. His mother, Hazel (Heden) May, was a homemaker.\nMr. May\u2019s sister, Kathleen Fox, said his unquenchable intellectual curiosity was always combined with a defiant streak. After being accepted into Mensa, the high I.Q. society, and attending its meetings, Mr. May told her that the members were a \u201cbunch of dummies\u201d and that they weren\u2019t worth his time.\nMr. May studied physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. On graduating he took a job at Intel, the world\u2019s largest maker of computer chips, which had been founded a few years earlier.\nOnly several years into the job, after the company\u2019s chips had been found to be malfunctioning, Mr. May discovered the source of the problem through a process involving radioactive alpha particles. His discovery earned him his own laboratory and an award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. But calculating that his Intel stock options could sustain him through retirement, he resigned at 34.\nMr. May set out to write a science fiction novel inspired by the evolving science of cryptography and the writings of libertarians like Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard. When he struggled to bring off the novel, he turned to writing on early online forums run by groups like the Extropians and his own Cypherpunks.\nAs the Cypherpunks\u2019 most frequent contributor, and at the group\u2019s in-person meetings in the Bay Area, Mr. May advocated using cryptography to spread government secrets, as WikiLeaks later did, and to evade surveillance of individuals, which he believed would become more pervasive with the spread of computers.\nThese ideas brought the Cypherpunks into conflict with the government, which wanted to limit the spread of cryptography. But people who successfully fought to integrate cryptography into the internet in its early days, to protect the privacy of individuals, hailed Mr. May\u2019s writing as an inspiration.\n\u201cHe was ahead of the game and understood what was going to be happening and what these obscure technologies were going to bring about,\u201d said Steven Levy, who wrote about Mr. May extensively in the 1990s for Wired magazine and in the book \u201cCrypto\u201d (2001).\nIn addition to Ms. Fox, Mr. May is survived by his brother, Michael.\nMr. May kept a careful distance from the real world, leading a reclusive life. He often wrote about arming himself and waiting for government agents to show up. After the Cypherpunks faded in the early 2000s, he began expressing racist sentiments to other online groups.\nDespite alienating many of his old allies, some of his ideas have recently come into vogue again with the rise of WikiLeaks and Bitcoin and the growing concerns about government surveillance.\nIn an interview in October with the website CoinDesk, Mr. May accused social media companies of helping to \u201cbuild the machinery of the Dossier Society,\u201d in which private citizens\u2019 personal information can be monitored and sold. He was also critical of the get-rich-quick mentality of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\u201cI cannot give a ringing endorsement to where we are,\u201d he told CoinDesk, \u201cor generate a puff-piece about the great things already done.\u201d\nSusan Beachy contributed reporting.\nSusan Beachy contributed reporting.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The sneaker offer appearing in your mailbox after you sign up to run a race.\nFor years, marketers and technology companies have crept further into the homes and habits of Americans, arguing all the while that there is a fair and voluntary exchange taking place. The more we know about you, the argument goes, the more we can show you products you actually want instead of ads that just annoy you. Consumers, they say, are happily trading very specific information about their lives in order to receive this kind of personalized advertising and marketing \u2014 relevant ads, as the industry calls them.\nJoseph Turow, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the topic for years and vigorously disagrees with that interpretation. Research by Professor Turow and his colleagues has found that most Americans give up data for relevant ads not because of convenience, but resignation. Rather than participating in a rational exchange, he argues, consumers are giving up their personal information with \u201ca feeling of futility.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are very uncomfortable with surveillance, but they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Professor Turow said about the research, which involved a telephone survey of about 1,500 people across the country this year and in 2015. \u201cIn the real world, not having a frequent shopper card at the supermarket means you\u2019re going to lose 15 to 20 percent on purchases. It\u2019s very difficult for people to give up Facebook if all their friends are on Facebook.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s that calculus people have, rather than, geez, this is a rational decision I\u2019m making because I know this is what I have to do.\u201d\nProfessor Turow is among the academics, privacy advocates and regulators who have long been critical of how companies extricate vast amounts of personal information from consumers in the digital world. In 2018, it became harder for the tech and media industries to ignore those voices, with more consumers and lawmakers discovering how extensive, secretive and unstoppable data collection can be.\nThis year has seen a string of revelations about how Facebook mishandled data from its users, even sharing their private messages with large corporations like Spotify and Netflix. Tech executives have regularly appeared before Congress and been grilled about their companies\u2019 practices. European lawmakers passed a sweeping privacy law in Europe, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R. That was followed by a California state law on privacy, which its advocates hoped would serve as a model for the nation.\nNew questions emerged around how Google allows outside companies to scan and share data from consumers\u2019 Gmail accounts. Companies were found to be using our smartphones to watch our every step. The rise of internet-connected devices in the home has turned everything from televisions to children\u2019s thermometers into tools for targeted advertising. And that\u2019s just a sampling.\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve got work to do to regain people\u2019s trust,\u201d Steve Satterfield, director of privacy and public policy at Facebook, said in a statement. \u201cProtecting people\u2019s information requires stronger teams, better technology, and clearer policies, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been focused for most of 2018.\u201d\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe topic didn\u2019t suddenly materialize this year \u2014 The Wall Street Journal broke major ground on digital surveillance with its award-winning series \u201cWhat They Know\u201d in 2010.\nBut at that time Facebook was not yet public and Google was a fraction of its current size. Digital tracking has since become far more pervasive and intertwined with peoples\u2019 daily lives \u2014 advertisements follow them from their computers to their phones and even their TVs \u2014 and often, it can feel inescapable. Recently, Facebook told Gizmodo that even if people opt out of location sharing with the social network, it can still determine their location and use it for targeted advertising.\n\u201cThere are so many aspects of how companies deal with the public that obfuscates what actually goes on and so many attempts to placate people using jargon,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who write privacy policies who admit \u2014 they admit \u2014 that they aren\u2019t written for the public.\u201d\nIn their survey this year, researchers led by Professor Turow found that most Americans did not understand privacy policies on websites. More than half did not know the correct answer to this true-or-false statement: \u201cIf a website has a privacy policy, that means the site won\u2019t share user information with other sites or companies without permission.\u201d (The statement is false.)\nThe researchers also found that most Americans did not know that companies can legally collect and keep personal data on 13-year-olds as if they are adults. Companies are able to do that because the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law, extends only to children who are 12 and under.\n\u201cI would argue that\u2019s because people can\u2019t imagine that the law would allow this kind of attitude,\u201d Professor Turow said. The researchers conducted national surveys in 2015 and this year, working with two polling companies to interview a representative sample of Americans on their landlines and cellphones.\nThe findings are particularly notable as tech companies and marketers argue that individuals should be responsible for understanding and navigating all of these policies and their privacy settings. Some people may delete Facebook, but what about Instagram and WhatsApp? Avoiding Google for search purposes is one thing. Then try avoiding Gmail, YouTube and Waze.\nAdvertisers are watching closely as Americans question these services. They are the ones, after all, paying to use all this data to send messages to the right consumers. There is a stark difference between targeting consumers who are eagerly sharing their information for so-called relevance and targeting those who have given up, and who may not even understand how, exactly, their data is being collected and interpreted.\nStill, little has been said publicly. While some ad agency executives have criticized Facebook in recent weeks, other executives have sought to neutralize those remarks. Last month, Rishad Tobaccowala, the chief growth officer of the advertising firm Publicis Groupe, questioned Facebook\u2019s moral compass in an interview with The New York Times. Shortly afterward, Facebook distributed more conciliatory comments from Arthur Sadoun, the chief executive of Publicis. Mr. Sadoun acknowledged the company\u2019s issues but added, \u201cWe believe that the management is taking the right decisions that are going in the right direction.\u201d\nA similar reaction emerged after the chief executive of the agency Initiative said in a LinkedIn post that he would advise his clients to halt advertising on Facebook based on its \u201cegregious behavior\u201d involving consumer data. Michael Roth, the chief executive of the Interpublic Group, which owns Initiative, quickly told The Wall Street Journal that the company would continue to \u201cwork closely with our media partners,\u201d including Facebook.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Americans see privacy as an important issue,\u201d Professor Turow said. \u201cThe question is: What do you do about it?\"", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The complaint accuses him of conspiring with members of the religious group Lev Tahor to kidnap the siblings and take them south of the border.\nMr. Rosner, 45, is the brother of one of the group\u2019s leaders, who was also involved in the kidnapping plan, according to the complaint.\nThe men were part of a group of at least six co-conspirators who worked to bring the children to Lev Tahor\u2019s community in Guatemala, the complaint said.\nOn Friday morning, the children were recovered in Mexico, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, and plans were underway to reunite them with their mother.\nLev Tahor, which translates to \u201cpure heart\u201d in Hebrew, is an offshoot of an anti-Zionist Hasidic sect. Members of the group practice a strict form of Orthodox Judaism. The group reportedly eschews technology and requires its female members to wear black robes from head to toe. Critics call the group a \u201ccult.\u201d\nThe group started in Jerusalem in the 1980s. The rabbi who formed the sect, Shlomo Helbrans, relocated them to a Brooklyn yeshiva in 1990.\nOver the years, children in Lev Tahor have often been subjected to \u201cphysical, sexual and emotional abuse,\u201d according to the complaint. Mr. Helbrans was himself arrested in New York in 1993 on charges that he kidnapped a teenager who was then studying with the rabbi in preparation for his bar mitzvah. The boy\u2019s parents accused Mr. Helbrans of brainwashing their son; Mr. Helbrans accused the parents of abusing their son.\nMr. Helbrans was found guilty of kidnapping and served two years in prison. He was released on parole in 1996 and was deported to Israel in 2000. The rabbi and his followers then established a Lev Tahor community in Quebec, Canada, in the early 2000s. After legal troubles there involving allegations of child abuse and child marriages, members of the group left Canada and eventually resettled in Guatemala.\nBefore the kidnapping, the children and their mother were part of the religious community in Guatemala, according to the complaint, when the mother, who is also Mr. Helbrans\u2019s daughter, decided to leave the group and move to Woodridge, N.Y., in October of this year.\nA new leader had taken charge of Lev Tahor, and the group had become more extreme, according to the complaint. The woman spoke out against changes in the group, the complaint said. Then she decided her children would no longer be safe if they stayed with Lev Tahor.\nAbout six weeks after the move, in the early hours of Dec. 8, Yante Teller, 14, and her 12-year-old brother, Chaim, got into a vehicle in front of their home in Woodridge and were driven away. The State Police asked the public\u2019s help in finding the children, saying they were believed to be headed to New York City.\nTheir ultimate destination was much farther. Mr. Rosner worked with several people across the United States, Mexico and Guatemala to try to return the siblings to the Lev Tahor community in Guatemala, the complaint said.\nThe children were taken to an airport outside Scranton, Pa., where surveillance footage showed them being ushered through airport security by a man whom the complaint does not identify. Days later, the children were in Mexico, the complaint said.\nIt remained unclear Thursday how the children were found in Mexico. The Department of Justice said it could not comment on their whereabouts. The State Police referred questions about the investigation to the F.B.I. An F.B.I. spokeswoman said the agency could not comment on nonemergency matters because of staffing plans related to the federal government shutdown.\nAround the time of the kidnapping, Mr. Rosner sent seven wire transfers to a man in Mexico, according to the complaint. He also organized multiple conference calls with co-conspirators in the kidnapping and spoke with them about hotels in Mexico, flights, bus tickets, credit cards and food, the complaint said.\nHe was detained pending trial as of Thursday afternoon, the Justice Department said.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It reconfirms the impression that Le Carr\u00e9 belongs to the select company of such spy and detective story writers as Arthur Conan Doyle and Graham Greene in England and Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald in America. There are those who read crime and espionage books for the plot and those who read them for the atmosphere; the former talk of \"ingenious puzzles\" and take pride in \"pure ratiocination\"; the latter think themselves more literary, worry about style and characterization, and tend to praise their favorite writers as \"real novelists.\" Le Carr\u00e9's books -- like those of the six authors just mentioned -- offer plenty for both kinds of readers.\n\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" is fluently written; it is full of vivid character sketches of secret agents and bureaucrats from all levels of British society , and the dialogue catches their voices well. The social and physical details of English life and the day to day activities of the intelligence service at home and abroad are convincing. Unlike many writers Le Carr\u00e9 is at his best showing men hard at work; he is fascinated by the office politics of the agency since the war. He even has a go at such \"novelistic\" effects as interlocking themes of sexual and political betrayal. Yet the plot is as tangled and suspenseful as any action fan could require, and the inductive skill of the diffident, intellectual hero should bring joy to the hearts of the purists. The scale and complexity of this novel are much greater than in any of Le Carr\u00e9's previous books. It marks a happy return to the spy genre for Le Carr\u00e9 ; his last book, \"The Na\u00d4ve and Sentimental Lover\" (1971), was a pretentious romantic story about a businessman, a writer and the woman they share -- an inept psychosexual portrait of the bourgeois and the bohemian soul.\nLe Carr\u00e9's career has been erratic from the start. Unlike most genre writers, he has never simply cranked out books according to a formula. His first two novels -- a modest spy story, \"Call for the Dead,\" in 1961 and a rather poor detective story, \"A Murder of Quality,\" in 1962 -- gave little sense that Le Carr\u00e9 would ever amount to very much. But his third book -- \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" in 1963 -- was manifestly the work of a strong and original popular novelist and was greeted with enthusiasm by such British worthies as C. P. Snow, J. B. Priestley and Graham Greene (who called it \"the best spy story I have ever read\"). The book became one of the great international best sellers of the 1960's and was the first thriller to dominate the American best seller lists for an entire year. Le Carr\u00e9 was established as an accomplished, intelligent genre writer as far from Ian Fleming as Ross Macdonald is from Mickey Spillane. His next book, \"The Looking Glass War\" in 1965, also sold well but it was distinctly less exciting, more of an atmospheric short story than a novel, for all its length. \"A Small Town in Germany\" in 1968 sold less well but is a most impressive popular novel; yet after it Le Carr\u00e9 abandoned the genre to write \"The Na\u00d4ve and Sentimental Lover,\" a book that failed with both critics and public.\n\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" is a full recovery, which in many ways consolidates Le Carr\u00e9's career. Its hero is a character whom Le Carr\u00e9 has used in almost every book, sometimes as the hero, sometimes in a minor role. Now he is more carefully developed than ever before.\nGeorge Smiley is a pudgy, middle-aged secret agent who seems \"breathtakingly ordinary.\" He's a quiet, bespectacled Oxford man with an interest in 17th-century German literature, an embarrassed or abstracted air, considerable physical awkwardness, and ill-fitting though expensive clothes. He is married to a glamorous, intelligent, aristocratic wife who (as at the start of every novel) has run off with one of her many lovers.\nSmiley is thus an anti-James Bond, an unheroic, frequently cuckolded secret agent who looks like a shy and miserable clerk in an old London bank. In fact, of course, Smiley is the finest secret agent in the world; his pathetic demeanor conceals a brilliant mind and stout heart. Smiley is one of the last English gentlemen -- not a strutting parody of the clubman, like Bond, or a foppish and conniving political type, but an honorable, decent fellow who hasn't much hope or comfort in the postwar world. He is the sorry witness of national decline, epitomized by the service: \"The inspired amateurism of a handful of highly qualified, underpaid men had given way to the efficiency, bureaucracy and intrigue of a large Government department.\"\nThe dramatic and sociological possibilities of such a hero are considerable, and in his new novel Le Carr\u00e9 certainly makes the most of them; but in his first two books he could barely see them: the novels stumble along quite artlessly, the prose is undistinguished. Instead of using Smiley as a means of criticizing the Establishment in its conduct of the secret service -- as he does in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" -- he first made Smiley a docile employe, then took him entirely out of the service and, somewhat hesitantly, put him up against the snobbery of an English public school.\nIn \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" Le Carr\u00e9 created a new hero, Alec Leamas, as a means of expressing an angry revaluation of the profession of espionage and the conventions of its fiction. Smiley appears only once, as a prissy little man, a part of the Establishment, fixing things up after Leamas has gone to jail. Leamas, by contrast, is an aggressive field agent, not a desk man; he is very strong, \"built like a swimmer,\" quick to anger, cynical, \"not quite a gentleman\" -- a virile, middle-aged angry young man who suggests more of James Bond's cold physical competence than Smiley's bumbling intellection.\nIn the end, after multiple twists and turns of the plot have revealed that Leamas's boss is as filthy as his East German enemies, Leamas declaims the ostensibly anti-romantic message of the book: \"What do you think spies are: priests, saints, martyrs? They're a squalid procession of vain fools, traitors too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives.\" The British use spies \"so that the great moronic mass you admire can sleep soundly in their beds at night. They need [them] for the safety of ordinary crummy people like you and me.\"\nThere's clearly more than a little adolescent corn in this -- an easy romanticism of the sordid, a self-serving protestation that really honest people (like Leamas) who truly care about individual lives and the harmony of ends and means are simply not fit for this filthy world. There's a strong dose of moral snobbery and self-pity in Leamas's final self-sacrifice for love. But it is of just such vigorous clich\u00c8s that strong popular fiction is made. Leamas's aggression and physical activity seem to have brought Le Carr\u00e9 to life: the prose is quick, the dialogue right on pitch, the plot complex but highly charged, the background on life in England and Germany and on the methods and routines of the intelligence service is detailed and convincing. When le Carr\u00e9 had used Smiley as his hero, he had not been able to release the operatic energy of this book at its best (and worst).\n\"The Looking Glass War\" continued and deepened the critique of the intelligence service Establishment, but Le Carr\u00e9 was trapped within the point of view of a young, weak and na\u00d4ve hero quite unlike Leamas; the only active character in the book is a doomed, outmoded field agent -- a Danzig Pole desperate to be accepted as a real English gentleman. Le Carr\u00e9 goes into impressive and loving detail about the deluded old men of an inefficient sub-department of intelligence. Smiley appears in this book as an ominous representative of a rival agency, a member of the evil but realistic modern espionage Establishment, effective but devoid of honor and idealism.\n\"A Small Town in Germany\" was much more successful because it set a brutal, lower-class interrogator (who does resemble Leamas in many ways) against a cross-section of the Establishment (the British Embassy in Bonn) and had him chasing a seemingly insignificant fellow who has a touch of Smiley's pathos and turns out to have more brains, morals and political ideals than the bosses. The portrait of the city and of the Embassy and its employes is the best sustained description Le Carr\u00e9 achieved before his new book. The use of historical details and the sense of the German political climate during Britain's bid for entry to the Common Market are ambitions and well done. The plot is strong but relatively simple, a straight line: find the defector, expose hypocrisy, all in a few days.\nIn \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" Smiley comes to stand for moral and intellectual authority. He is the best man, responding to the call of duty: to spy against his former colleagues. Le Carr\u00e9 has learned a lot since he first created Smiley; he now can handle complementary heroes and intertwining plots. The story of Jim Prideaux, a strong field agent like Leamas who was shot in the back in suspicious circumstances abroad, counterpoints Smiley's research activities with melodramatic foreign adventures. In yet a further reclamation of old territory, Le Carr\u00e9 also sets the subplot at a public school, which is much more vividly portrayed than that in his second novel. His characterization too has become much richer: we meet Cabinet ministers, Whitehall officials, aides, journalists, old office hands; and there is an extremely dextrous off-stage portrait of Smiley's faithless wife. Le Carr\u00e9 has never presented so much detail about the intelligence Establishment, and he moves easily from past to present, from adventure to research and induction, and keeps one guessing right to the end which of the five top men is the double agent. Smiley has become humanity at its decent English best; the glamour of the Empire has faded, but he quietly carries on.\nLe Carr\u00e9's originality and distinction as a popular novelist lie in his use of the conventions of the spy novel for purposes of social criticism. In his introduction to The London Sunday Times Insight Team's study of \"The Philby Conspiracy\" (1968), Le Carr\u00e9 remarked that the career of the double agent Kim Philby -- who is a protype of the double agent in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" -- illustrates the \"capacity of the British ruling class for reluctant betrayal and polite self-preservation.\" The British secret services are \"microcosms of the British condition, of our social attitudes and vanities.\"\nIt is the late Victorian fantasy of \"the inarticulate supremacy of the English gentleman\" that is expressed in the traditional British spy novel. The genre grew with the British Empire; Stevensonian boy's novels of adventure in exotic places came to express a grandiose political and racial delusion from Kipling's \"Kim\" (1901) and John Buchan's \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" (1915), through W. Somerset Maugham's ostensibly cool and antiheroic \"Ashenden: or, The British Agent\" (1928) and Eric Ambler's \"A Coffin for Dimitrios\" (1939), right down to the camp, compensatory fantasies of dying Empire in Ian Fleming's James Bond series (1953-1965) and the hardboiled killers of Len Deighton's \"The Ipcress File\" (1962) or Frederick Forsyth's \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1971).\nIn none of these books do the authors worry about ends and means and class inequities. Since \"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\" Le Carr\u00e9 always does. He employs the techniques and conventions of these spy novels and is obviously concerned with the management of suspenseful effects -- there are plenty of pursuits and disguises and escapes in his books -- but he also draws upon the great tradition of English social realism, especially that part which in many ways begins with Dickens's \"Bleak House\" in 1853. In that novel Dickens uses a detective to help resolve the action: Inspector Bucket of the London Police brings the questing heroine to the symbolic center of England -- a dark graveyard in a London slum from which a smallpox epidemic and a network of deadlocked legal and sexual claims have spread out like ripples in a filthy well until they touch all of British society.\nThis symbolic and melodramatic kind of social criticism was continued in Henry James's \"The Princess Casamassima\" (1886) and Joseph Conrad's \"The Secret Agent\" (1907), in both of which the political spectre of anarchism was introduced. By the 1930's and 1940's Graham Greene could draw on this tradition to write chiaroscuro thrillers in which sordid crimes and rotten ideologies are portrayed as emblems of man's fallen condition; \"The Confidential Agent\" (1939) and \"The Ministry of Fear\" (1943) employed both the conventions of the spy novel and the critical possibilities of the Dickensian mode in order to express Roman Catholic theology. In much the same way, Norman Mailer in \"Barbary Shore\" (1951) mixed these traditions to present an ideological debate about socialism.\nSince 1960 the newspapers have been full of major spy stories: the U-2 overflights, the Philby conspiracy, the dangers of the Profumo affair, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban missile crisis, the Kennedy assassination, the C.I.A.'s activities in Indochina and Latin America, the rise of domestic surveillance and agents provocateurs, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, the resignation of Willy Brandt. Le Carr\u00e9's novels perfectly express the moral and political disillusion such revelations evoke in citizens of democratic countries who have long prided themselves on their \"open societies.\"\nAt one point in \"A Small Town in Germany\" a character repeats the old saw that a diplomat is a gentleman who lies for his country. Le Carr\u00e9's novels show us that such gentlemen are actually unprincipled fools and knaves quite given over to lying to their countrymen, their professional colleagues, their wives and themselves. The professions of diplomacy and espionage have very nearly become the same; the distinctions between the creation and execution of foreign policy are quite dangerously blurred. The \"great game,\" as Kipling called the maintenance of the British Empire by espionage in \"Kim,\" is no longer the sport of \"inspired amateurs\" or a \"secret elite\" who insure the beneficent rule of the all-wise British Lion. The lion is mangy, the Empire has crumbled, the agents have all gone to seed or become brutes and traitors available to the highest bidder or dangerously prone to political and ideological delusions.\nHowever, are not Le Carr\u00e9's novels, even at their best, falsely comforting? For all their angry social criticism, they always offer us the pleasures of imagining the world as it was portrayed in the good old-fashioned English novel of class and character, manners and morals: the surface details of the physical and social world are clearly seen; people's looks and voices are immediately categorized and brightly reproduced; the plots are complex, suspenseful, full of historical details, but they are always triumphantly concluded, all mysteries and ambiguities neatly resolved. The psychology is straightforward; motives tend to be unmixed; the tangles of sex and family life are simplified.\nLe Carr\u00e9's novels appear to dispel the romantic illusion of a strong, noble British Daddy who knows best: but is not George Smiley essentially a somewhat reduced and saddened but good old British Daddy all the same? Leamas dies a violent death, Smiley lives to rejoin his wife and spy another day; but in both cases they perpetuate national stereotypes. Quite inadvertently Le Carr\u00e9's novels reinforce the sodden liberalism they claim to condemn. They are nostalgic and given to self-pity; they offer two-dimensional models of human experience, melodramatic or sentimental answers to political dilemmas, and the simplistic and self-comforting suggestion that good men (and readers) should give up politics for lost and--like the victimized boy Candide -- go and cultivate their gardens. Le Carr\u00e9's books repeatedly express a horrified, morally outraged but essentially naive retreat from the full imagination of politics and society. His novels thus bear only superficial resemblance to such complex and ironic spy novels as Kurt Vonnegut's \"Mother Night\" (1961), Anthony Burgess's \"A Tremor of Intent\" (1967) and -- on the grand scale -- Thomas Pynchon's \"V.\" (1963) and \"Gravity's Rainbow\" (1973). In those books human experience is intrinsically problematical, often absurd; in Le Carr\u00e9's books everything works out. When Le Carr\u00e9 tried for depth in his last novel, he failed; modernism and the ironies of the literary novels of the 1960's are beyond him; but when, as in this new book, he shows the surface of experience in that good old-fashioned way, he is thoroughly entertaining.\nRichard Locke is an editor of The New York Times Book Review.\nReturn to the Books Home Page\n|\n|\nHome | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace\nQuick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel\nHelp/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

There was baked ham, green beans and cherry pie for lunch. There was music \u2014 oldies and Christmas carols mostly. One club member, 84-year-old Herman Atwood, danced to \u201cMy Girl,\u201d twisting and twirling in his Sears Roebuck sweater vest as if he was at a wedding.\nSears may be struggling to survive after filing for bankruptcy in October, its rundown and empty stores symbolizing a has-been company that failed to adapt. But across the country, legions of former Sears workers like Mr. Atwood, a retired truck driver, gather regularly to reminisce about their long careers in retailing. The brands like Kenmore and DieHard that lasted for decades. The limitless creativity of shoplifters. The impossible task of selecting the women\u2019s shoe inventory.\nFor an older generation of Sears retirees, their former employer remains a central part of their lives, a throwback in an industry now known for high turnover, low wages and costly health care. Today, there are dozens of Sears alumni groups, from Bangor, Me., to Sioux Falls, S.D., forming one of the largest and most active retiree networks in the nation.\n\u201cIt feels like family,\u201d Mattie Hughey said as she sat with three friends she met packing catalog orders in the Sears warehouse in Atlanta 30 years ago.\nLong before it went bankrupt, before it was taken over by the hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert, and before Amazon pioneered internet shopping, Sears was the nation\u2019s largest retailer, with about 350,000 employees near its peak.\nIn its heyday, a period stretching from the end of World War II to the 1970s, Sears offered many of its workers a clear path to the middle class. The company paid well, shared profits and provided retirement benefits that have helped many former employees live in relative comfort.\nMadison Price, 87, comes every year to the holiday luncheon to see old friends and soak in the music. He grew up working on a farm in Georgia, helping grow cotton and corn. His father split the proceeds from their crops with the man who owned the farm. Mr. Price didn\u2019t finish high school and often missed school because he was needed on the farm.\nAfter returning from the Korean War, Mr. Price got a job as a janitor in a store in Atlanta in 1958. When he retired after 34 years, Mr. Price sold the Sears stock the company had granted him over the years and took his pension in a lump sum.\nHe reinvested the money only in things that he uses: shares in Georgia\u2019s power utilities and municipal bonds of DeKalb County and the Atlanta airport. Today, Mr. Price said he drew enough in dividends and interest from his investment portfolio, along with Social Security, to live comfortably. He paid for his son\u2019s college tuition, and his wife, Earnestine, has been able to take trips with her friends.\n\u201cI am blessed,\u201d Mr. Price said.\nMany of the retirees at the luncheon said they viewed their time at Sears as being part of something bigger than just working at a successful retailer. They worked for a force in American culture and business. Sears sold everything: feed for chickens, Whirlpool washing machines, as well as the nightgowns, watches and erector sets in the Christmas \u201cwish book.\u201d\n\u201cOne man came by looking for a wagon for his horse,\u201d said Jerril Parker, who worked in security at Sears in the Atlanta area for 45 years.\nSears also had an outsize physical presence. In Atlanta, the company occupied one of the largest buildings in the region \u2014 a store, warehouse and regional office covering over two million square feet. The red brick warehouse on Ponce De Leon Avenue was a precursor to the e-commerce fulfillment centers that shipped thousands of items ordered through the catalog.\nMr. Parker recalled hiding in a refrigerator box with small holes cut into the side so he could conduct surveillance on employees unloading merchandise.\nOne day, Mr. Parker said, his security staff caught a young seasonal worker trying to steal seven plaid skirts for his sister and her cheerleading squad by wearing them under his pants. \u201cHe just kept getting bigger and bigger through the day,\u201d Mr. Parker said.\nSears workers became experts in their fields \u2014 heating systems, kitchen appliances, cosmetics. And they were proud of what they sold. Elder Penny, who started at Sears after serving as a Navy supply officer in World War II, was a regional buyer of women\u2019s shoes. Mr. Penny, 94, still has the same Kenmore refrigerator he bought at Sears in 1974.\n\u201cI think I will wear out before it does,\u201d he said.\nThere was also a feeling of camaraderie and support. Decades ago, the Sears headquarters in Illinois were referred to as \u201cparent\u201d \u2014 a telling symbol of the way employees viewed their employer.\nExperienced workers took new recruits under their wing. When a manager relocated to a new store, other employees there helped him look for a new home.\nBill Rudolph, 66, came to the lunch with his friend Dorothy Davis, who he met when he was a manager in a Sears in the Atlanta area. He picked up Ms. Davis, 89, at her home and gave her a ride because she has stopped driving.\nMr. Rudolph, who started at Sears when he was 18, said Ms. Davis and other women looked out for him during his early years at the company. Mr. Rudolph went on to become a director of operations nationally before retiring in March after 47 years.\n\u201cIt was a place where people cared for each other,\u201d said Mr. Rudolph, who was overcome with emotion recalling the help he received from the older women.\nSears today is nothing like the company many retirees remember. The retailer stopped profit-sharing in the 1970s and more recently hired employees no longer receive pensions. Under its chairman, Mr. Lampert, the company has been selling off many of its most valuable stores and laying off thousands of workers.\nOn Friday, Mr. Lampert, through his hedge fund, ESL Investments, made a $4.4 billion bid to acquire many of the company\u2019s remaining assets, including its retail stores. Mr. Lampert said the proposal would keep 50,000 workers employed.\nRetirees warned long ago that Mr. Lampert\u2019s involvement with Sears would end badly. When his hedge fund acquired the company in 2005 by merging it with Kmart, a group of former workers hired a plane to fly over the headquarters in Illinois pulling a banner that read, \u201cSears Unfair to Retirees.\u201d\nThe group, National Association of Retired Sears Employees, has been keeping a close eye on their former employer under Mr. Lampert. They hold regular conference calls, where members detail the conditions of local Sears stores.\n\u201cI was in an auto center having four tires put on the other day,\u201d reported Jim McCurtain, a retiree from Tampa, on last month\u2019s conference call. \u201cThey did a great job.\u201d\nAnother retiree on the call reported that her friend successfully had the ice maker in her refrigerator cleaned out by a Sears repairman, whom she noted was \u201cvery precise, very courteous.\u201d\nThe retirees\u2019 pensions are expected to survive the bankruptcy largely intact thanks to a backstop from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But if Sears goes into a liquidation, which many analysts and investors say is likely, then the retirees would lose most of their life insurance benefits.\nIn the current incarnation of Sears, recruiting new members to the alumni groups has been difficult. Two decades ago, there were 250 clubs, now there are only about 45. More recent retirees, who did not receive pensions or profit-sharing, do not share the same allegiance as older generations.\n\u201cSears was a great company,\u201d said Ron Olbrysh, who retired from the Sears legal department in the 1990s and is now chairman of the national retiree association \u201cBut I am glad we got out when we did.\u201d\nAge is another challenge. The Atlanta club regularly updates its 160 members with a \u201cbereavement report\u201d listing local retirees who have died.\nAs the luncheon in Decatur finished, Lynn Walker Capland lingered in the church hall, helping clean off the tables and talking with friends. Ms. Capland, 66, is not only a former employee, she is what she calls a \u201cbyproduct of Sears.\u201d Her mother and father met while working at the Christmas pickup window in the Atlanta store.\nMs. Walker left the company before reaching retirement age because she said she wasn\u2019t suited for her final job in the collections department. But she still takes a day off from current work at an accounting firm to attend the luncheon every year.\n\u201cNo one makes time for these types of things anymore. Everyone is so busy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis way of life is almost gone.\u201d\nMichael Corkery is a business reporter who covers the retail industry and its impact on consumers, workers and the economy.

Alive\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In one of their final acts in the House majority, Republicans released a letter on Friday urging their Senate counterparts to pick up their politically charged inquiry into the handling of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigations of President Trump\u2019s campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and called again for the appointment of a special counsel to study the matter.\nDetailing some of their findings, the chairmen of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees said it appeared to them that the F.B.I. had treated the Trump and Clinton cases differently, cutting Mrs. Clinton and her associates crucial breaks while assigning agents who privately exchanged reams of messages bashing Mr. Trump to investigate his campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\n\u201cIt is not the discovery of bias that is so destructive to fairness, it is the existence of it,\u201d the chairmen, Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia and Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, wrote of the officials.\nThey also used the letter to resurface Republicans\u2019 contested charge that the F.B.I. abused sensitive surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign associate believed to be compromised by Russia.\nComing on a Friday evening before the New Year\u2019s holiday, the letter was an anemic end to a high-profile congressional investigation that has deeply divided Capitol Hill and delivered Mr. Trump a steady stream of talking points to attack the special counsel who inherited the Russia inquiry and others investigating him.\nIt amounted to an admission that Republican investigators from the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees had not completed the work they began in October 2017, and the letter did not appear to disclose any major previously unknown facts.\nHouse Democrats insisted throughout the investigation that Republicans\u2019 efforts were not carried out in good faith, accusing them of using Congress\u2019s oversight powers to relitigate the Clinton case and target those investigating Mr. Trump. When they take control of the committees next week, Democrats plan to reorient their investigative focus toward the president himself and his policies.\nIn a sign of how central investigations will be to the Democratic House, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the presumptive speaker, said on Friday that she had hired Douglas N. Letter, a former high-level Justice Department official with decades of experience, to serve as the House\u2019s top lawyer.\nMr. Goodlatte and Mr. Gowdy rejected assertions that their investigation had intentionally targeted the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. They said their goal was to restore confidence in institutions damaged in 2016.\n\u201cQuite the opposite, whatever product is produced by the special counsel must be trusted by Americans, and that requires asking tough but fair questions about investigative techniques both employed and not employed,\u201d they wrote. Both men are retiring in the coming days.\nBut after a slow start, the investigation came to encompass a bevy of politically charged topics and allowed Republicans to parade through Capitol Hill top F.B.I. and Justice Department officials involved in investigations.\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders in the House sit on the committees and used the investigation as a bludgeon on behalf of the president and to declare the Mueller investigation woefully biased against him. When the Justice Department balked at producing sensitive documents about the Trump inquiry, several Republicans threatened to impeach Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general then overseeing the investigation.\nThe letter from Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Gowdy was addressed to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader; Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general; and Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.\nMr. Horowitz is looking at many of the same issues the committee did and already released a 500-page report on the F.B.I.\u2019s conduct this year focused on the Clinton email case. It painted an unflattering picture of top bureau officials \u2014 including describing James B. Comey, the former director, as insubordinate and detailing texts by two senior officials bashing Mr. Trump \u2014 but did not challenge the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton should not be prosecuted.\nMr. Horowitz is expected to release a second report sometime next year on the period focused on the opening of the investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia and the bureau\u2019s surveillance of the former Trump adviser, Carter Page.\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who will take over next week as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has said he plans to continue some of the investigative work done by House Republicans.\nRepublicans on the committees plan to release transcripts of each witness interview they conducted, including sessions with Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director; Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official targeted by Mr. Trump over his contacts with the author of a salacious dossier alleging coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia; and other top F.B.I. officials.

Silicon Valley Fears Losing Its Edge\nThe Commerce Department is considering national security restrictions on artificial intelligence. Some worry they could stunt the industry in the U.S.\nSupported by\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A common belief among tech industry insiders is that Silicon Valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by Americans.\nNow a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of American companies in the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.\nIn November, the Commerce Department released a list of technologies, including artificial intelligence, that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security.\nTechnology experts worry that blocking the export of A.I. to other countries, or tying it up in red tape, will help A.I. industries flourish in those nations \u2014 China, in particular \u2014 and compete with American companies.\n\u201cThe number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very, very, very small, and the chance of making an error is quite large,\u201d said Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco. \u201cIf this goes wrong, it could do real damage to the A.I. community.\u201d\nThe export controls are being considered as the United States and China engage in a trade war. The Trump administration has been critical of the way China negotiates deals with American companies, often requiring the transfer of technology to Chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country. And federal officials are making an aggressive argument that China has stolen American technology through hacking and industrial espionage.\nTech companies, academics and policymakers are calling on the Commerce Department to take a light hand with A.I. export rules ahead of a Jan. 10 deadline for public comment. Their argument has three main points: Restrictions could harm companies in the United States and help international competitors. They could stifle technology improvements. And they may not make much of a difference.\nIn August, Congress passed the Export Controls Act of 2018, which added export restrictions to \u201cemerging and foundational technologies.\u201d In mid-November, the Commerce Department, tasked with overseeing the restrictions, published a list of technologies for consideration, including several categories of A.I. like computer vision, speech recognition and natural language understanding.\nThe restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries. Though it does not specify which ones, the Commerce Department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past. Those include China, Russia and Iran.\nThe Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions. After taking public comments, the department will draft a formal plan. It could result in anything from new licensing rules for A.I. exports to outright bans.\nArtificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the World Wide Web was 25 years ago.\nIt is easy to forget that before the mid-1990s, the tech industry in the United States was in a slump and the consumer electronics giants of Japan looked unbeatable. That changed as Silicon Valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and e-commerce. Today, the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook dominate tech all over the world.\nBut American dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed. China is investing billions in A.I. for both commercial and military use. And the expertise that has flooded to Silicon Valley over the years is starting to stay home, partly because of immigration restrictions. Centers for A.I. research are popping up all over the world, from Toronto to Cambridge, England, and Beijing.\nEnforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulators.\nA.I. is something policymakers call a dual-use technology. It has innocuous commercial applications, like helping to steer your car or ask your phone a question. It also has important military uses, like helping a weaponized drone find its targets.\nDefense planners believe A.I. represents the next notable change in military weapons, akin to the tactical targeting of so-called smart bombs a generation ago or nuclear weapons before that. A.I. can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videos.\nBut \u201ctrying to draw a line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult,\u201d said R. David Edelman, a technology policy researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt may be impossible.\u201d\nIt is difficult to put a \u201cmade in America\u201d label on artificial intelligence. Research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the world.\nCompanies rarely hold on to the details of their A.I. work, as if it were a secret recipe. Instead, they share what they learn, in hopes that other researchers can build on it. One company\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working on.\nA lot of the computer code for A.I. is published on sites like Arxiv.org, a repository of academic and corporate research. So, many policy experts believe that if the United States restricts the export of A.I. products and services, it will have little effect on the progress of A.I. in China and other countries.\n\u201cThe core of these technologies is international and freely available,\u201d said Mr. Edelman, who was a special assistant for economic and technology policy under President Barack Obama. \u201cNo country \u2014 the U.S. or China \u2014 has a monopoly on that.\u201d\nFederal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control. That means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental A.I. research. But it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information, said Greg Jaeger, a lawyer at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who deals with export controls.\nThe Commerce Department could also restrict the export of cloud-computing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence. The export restrictions memo mentions both.\nAmazon and Microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in China through local partners, and Google has long hoped to do the same thing. Amazon, Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\nOverly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the United States could also push researchers and companies into other countries.\n\u201cIt might be easier for people to just do this stuff in Europe,\u201d said Jason Waite, a lawyer with the firm Alston & Bird who specializes in international trade.\nFollow Cade Metz on Twitter: @CadeMetz\nAdvertisement", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\nDemocrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.\nThe events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u2014 poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u2014 who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nWith the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.\n\u201cCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a subject to walk away from.\u201d\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u201cWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u201d\n\u201cHe could not give a good answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\nMr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u201ca good Catholic\u201d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.\n[Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts. Read more fact checks from the president's cabinet meeting on Wednesday.]\nIn her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.\nMr. Trump\u2019s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.\nThe president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u2019s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.\nIn a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u201cI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u2019s get it done!\u201d\nBut the path to such a deal is murky at best.\nBefore he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.\n\u201cNo, not $2.5 billion, no \u2014 we\u2019re asking for $5.6\u201d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.\nHis rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.\nThe larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.\nBut inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.\nWednesday\u2019s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u2014 and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.\nBut it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.\nMr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u2019s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cDemocrats in the room either don\u2019t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u201d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was incredibly disheartening that they don\u2019t want to know the facts when making policy.\u201d\nYet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.\n\u201cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\u201d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u201ca sieve\u201d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.\n\u201cWalls work,\u201d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u201caround his compound\u201d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)\nMr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.\nOutside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u2019s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nIncoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u2019s effect. \u201cThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u201d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.\nShe noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u201cI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u201d she said.\nPeter Baker and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The shootings occurred about six miles apart, he said.\nLee Merritt, a Philadelphia-based lawyer representing Jazmine\u2019s family, said on Saturday he believed the shooting had the markings of a hate crime, in part because of the \u201crandomness and unprovoked nature\u201d of the attack.\nUnited States Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Houston, said the racial dynamics of the case were apparent. \u201cDo not be afraid to call this what it seems to be: a hate crime,\u201d she told the crowd, demanding an investigation by the Justice Department.\nAfter Jazmine\u2019s killing, the public mobilized to help the family. Mr. Merritt and Shaun King, a prominent racial justice activist and a columnist at The Intercept, have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the gunman\u2019s arrest. DeAndre Hopkins, a wide receiver for the Houston Texans, pledged to donate his paycheck from this weekend\u2019s playoff game, which amounts to $29,000, to help pay for Jazmine\u2019s funeral.\nAt the rally on Saturday, supporters clutched banners and artwork dedicated to Jazmine, who was in second grade at a Houston-area school.\n\u201cNo peace, no justice,\u201d the crowd chanted. Many parents said the shooting put them in fear of their own lives and those of their children.\nThe site of the rally, a Walmart parking lot, was about a half-mile from where the attack took place, said Lt. Eric Batton of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The store provided the police with the first clue about the gunman\u2019s identity: images of his pickup truck captured by video surveillance.\nBut aside from a sketch of the gunman, his identity remains unknown. At the rally, Sheriff Gonzalez urged the crowd to keep reporting possible leads to police. \u201cWe\u2019re always just one phone call away from being able to break this case,\u201d he said.\nKim Green, a 44-year-old mother of two boys, said she drove more than 50 miles with her 12-year-old son, Khayman Clarkson, to attend the rally.\nShe clutched a banner reading \u201cJustice\u201d and \u201cJazmine\u201d and a drawing of a princess she planned to give the family.\n\u201cI have two black boys living in the middle of all these senseless killings,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely worried about my own children.

He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.\nDemocrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.\nThe events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats \u2014 poised to assume control of the House on Thursday \u2014 who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nWith the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.\n\u201cCould be a long time, or it could be quickly,\u201d Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a subject to walk away from.\u201d\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: \u201cWe are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?\u201d\n\u201cHe could not give a good answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said.\nMr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was \u201ca good Catholic\u201d and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.\n[Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts. Read more fact checks from the president's cabinet meeting on Wednesday.]\nIn her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.\nMr. Trump\u2019s rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.\nThe president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump\u2019s team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.\nIn a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: \u201cI remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let\u2019s get it done!\u201d\nBut the path to such a deal is murky at best.\nBefore he met congressional leaders on Wednesday, Mr. Trump publicly rejected a compromise that Mr. Pence floated privately with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, the vice president had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.\n\u201cNo, not $2.5 billion, no \u2014 we\u2019re asking for $5.6\u201d billion, Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting, hours before the Situation Room briefing.\nHis rejection of the figure seemed to confirm the concerns of Democratic leaders who had questioned whether they could trust senior White House officials to broker any compromise that could then be rejected by a president who has often shifted his position at the last moment, especially when it comes to immigration.\nThe larger figure referred to the amount Mr. Trump has demanded for the wall, which the House endorsed in a vote last month, but which failed to garner even majority support in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to prevail.\nBut inside the Situation Room later on Wednesday, the proposal resurfaced and Mr. Trump appeared open to it, according to one of the officials present, as Mr. Pence and Mr. McCarthy pressed Democrats to meet in the middle. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said $1.3 billion was their highest bid.\nWednesday\u2019s gathering in the Situation Room, a secure chamber in the basement of the White House where military operations are tracked and other sensitive discussions unfold, was a conscious effort by Mr. Trump and his aides to infuse a sense of national-security crisis into the immigration discussion. It was the president\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders since a combative session last month when he said he would insist that any government spending bill include money for a border wall \u2014 and would proudly own the consequences if that meant a shutdown.\nBut it quickly turned tense as Mr. Trump argued for his wall and called on Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, who appeared via teleconference from the border in San Diego to stress the need for it, according to two of the officials who were at the meeting.\nMr. Schumer interjected, calling on Ms. Pelosi, who disputed Ms. Nielsen\u2019s statistics, two of the officials said. Ms. Pelosi then laid out the legislative proposals she planned to bring up on Thursday, detailing how the spending measures had all received broad bipartisan support either in committees or on the floor in the Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe back and forth drew an angry response from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\u201cDemocrats in the room either don\u2019t care that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border or just prefer ignorance,\u201d Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was incredibly disheartening that they don\u2019t want to know the facts when making policy.\u201d\nYet hours before the meeting began, what was billed as a somber security briefing had already taken on the sharp tone of a political showdown, as Mr. Trump charged that Democrats were sacrificing border security for a partisan advantage in the 2020 elections.\n\u201cThe United States needs a physical barrier,\u201d the president said during the cabinet meeting, comparing the southern border to \u201ca sieve\u201d that allows criminals and drugs to enter the country and facilitates human trafficking.\n\u201cWalls work,\u201d he added, claiming inaccurately that former President Barack Obama has one \u201caround his compound\u201d in Washington. (Parts of Mr. Obama\u2019s home in the northwest section of the city are bordered by a low brick retaining wall, and others have iron or chain-link fencing.)\nMr. Trump repeated his false claims about the border wall, including that Mexico was already paying for it, as he promised during his campaign, and that much of its construction had already been completed.\nOutside the White House, the search for a way out is getting more urgent. Some lawmakers have grown anxious about the shutdown\u2019s impact on their constituents, including federal workers who are not receiving pay while their agencies are denied funding.\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, wrote an opinion article in The Washington Post suggesting three ways out: Grant the president the $1.6 billion for border security that he requested, without wall funding, plus an additional $1 billion for security at ports of entry; approve a bipartisan bill linking wall funding with protection for young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children; or resurrect the 2013 comprehensive immigration overhaul that included huge increases in border security measures, sweeping changes to immigration law and a pathway to citizenship for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nIncoming lawmakers vented new concerns about the shutdown\u2019s effect. \u201cThis morning I requested that my pay be withheld until the shutdown is over,\u201d Representative-elect Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey, said Wednesday on Twitter, where she posted a letter to the chief administrative officer of the House making her request official.\nShe noted that thousands of federal workers in her state were not receiving paychecks. \u201cI came here to govern, not engage in partisan politics at the expense of hardworking Americans,\u201d she said.\nPeter Baker and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Experts Say That Makes Little Sense\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico, in one of his central justifications for building a border wall.\nBut his own government\u2019s assessments conclude that Mr. Trump has seriously overstated the threat. And counterterrorism officials and experts said there had never been a case of a known terrorist sneaking into the country through open areas of the southwest border.\nDespite the administration\u2019s focus on security threats at the border, a White House strategy document sent to Congress last month outlining steps needed to monitor and intercept terrorists included no reference to the need for construction of barriers, fences or walls. Separately, an intelligence analysis concluded that cyberattacks are the top threat to the United States \u2014 not terrorists at the border.\n\u201cThere is no wave of terrorist operatives waiting to cross overland into the United States,\u201d Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d\nIn a rare prime-time address to the nation, broadcast at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Trump was expected to describe a national security crisis brewing at the Mexican border. It was his opportunity to directly defend his demands for $5.7 billion for a border wall \u2014 funding that congressional Democrats have refused to provide, fueling the 18-day government shutdown.\nMany Latin American countries have border law enforcement gaps \u2014 limited law enforcement capabilities and established smuggling routes \u2014 that extremists could exploit to harm the United States, according to the State Department\u2019s latest Country Reports on Terrorism.\nBut, the report concluded, that has not happened.\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities offer opportunities to foreign terrorist groups, but there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region,\u201d the report said.\nThe latest ranking of urgent national security vulnerabilities, compiled annually by American intelligence agencies, puts the terrorist threat from the southwest border low on the list and then mentions it in a discussion of how \u201cworldwide production of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is at record levels.\u201d\nOver the last several days, White House and Department of Homeland Security officials have relentlessly pushed the case that the situation at the border is both a national security crisis and a humanitarian one.\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Sunday that \u201cnearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally,\u201d and added that the \u201cmost vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.\u201d\nA day later, Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, called those comments \u201can unfortunate misstatement.\u201d\nAt the same time, in a memo sent to journalists late Monday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, cited \u201cmore than 3,000 \u2018special-interest aliens\u2019 \u2014 individuals with suspicious travel patterns\u201d who posed a potential national security risk.\n\u201cThe threat is real,\u201d she wrote in a series of tweets on Monday afternoon. \u201cThe number of terror-watchlisted encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive and details about these cases are extremely sensitive.\u201d\nFormer national security officials and analysts have pushed back \u2014 especially on the notion that terrorism suspects or their sympathizers use the southwest border as a door to the United States.\n\u201cThat 4,000 number was bull,\u201d said W. Ralph Basham, who served as commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection from 2006 to 2009, during the Bush administration.\n\u201cThe idea that you have that many terrorists flooding across the border when you have all of these dedicated agents focused on stopping that kind of activity is ridiculous,\u201d Mr. Basham said.\nA senior American counterterrorism official said on Tuesday night that an annual average of three known or suspected terrorists \u2014 all of whom were on watch lists \u2014 had tried to enter the United States at a legal border crossing or entry point over the last several years, and had been denied.\nA 22-page National Strategy to Combat Terrorism Travel, overseen by the staff of the National Security Council and under Mr. Trump\u2019s signature, cited a broad commitment to making it \u201cmore difficult for terrorists to cross U.S. borders.\u201d\nSent to Congress on Dec. 21, the day before the government shutdown began, the document urged data sharing and improved coordination with foreign partners to identify terrorists before they travel. It did not urge the construction of a border wall.\nThe only explicit reference to \u201cborder security\u201d in the document, which was obtained on Tuesday by The New York Times, is a listing of executive orders that Mr. Trump has already signed. It also included strategies to \u201cinterdict\u201d potential terrorists with plans to \u201cmaintain the equipment and technology\u201d necessary to stop bad actors and share real-time information between law enforcement agencies.\nThe 2018 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ranked cyberattacks against utilities, communications systems and markets as the top threat to the United States. Published annually by American intelligence agencies, the ranking has not changed much over the past five years.\nBut the government shutdown has furloughed nearly half of the work force of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is advertised as the first line of defense against network attacks. Mr. Trump has also dismantled the office of the White House cybersecurity coordinator, the job that was supposed to sew together offense and defense against the daily barrage of cyberattacks.\nAfter cyberattacks, the top threats to the United States include the rise of smaller, more deadly nuclear and biological weapons; terrorist attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda; and Russian-style influence campaigns and threats to the United States\u2019 space assets.\nCounterterrorism officials have long discounted the threat of Islamic State or Qaeda terrorists entering through the southwest border. In some cases, the opposite has happened, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University\u2019s program on extremism, citing homegrown American extremists who crossed into Mexico to avoid being detected on no-fly lists.\nOfficials included the case of Jason Ludke of Milwaukee, who pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to provide material support to the Islamic State. He and a co-conspirator were headed to the border in Texas, with plans to join the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq, when they were arrested.\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mr. Ludke had planned to work under the Islamic State\u2019s direction and control and recorded a video of himself pledging his allegiance to the terrorist group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mr. Ludke told an undercover F.B.I. agent that he had training in jujitsu and computers, which he believed would benefit the Islamic State.\nEven as Mr. Trump has lobbied for the wall, he has also pressed the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security to immediately tighten security on the border.\nOn Dec. 27, homeland security officials asked for assistance that the Pentagon later estimated would require 3,000 additional military personnel to be sent to the border, according to memos exchanged by the two departments over the last two weeks. The force could include a combination of National Guard troops, active-duty military personnel and volunteers, but that was not made clear in the documents, officials said. It remains an issue of hot debate inside the Pentagon.\nThe Homeland Security Department also requested 146 mobile surveillance vehicles to be sent to four border states, along with enough personnel and material to install 150 additional miles of barbed concertina wire. The homeland security memo also again asked Defense Department officials to provide additional aviation support to monitor and control the flow of immigrants.\nThe Pentagon has not yet approved the request. It included guidelines for Ms. Nielsen and other homeland security officials to \u201ctake the lead\u201d on strategic communications intended to highlight the Pentagon\u2019s role. It also made clear the troops would carry no weapons.\nThomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

True, Mr. Trump has not been able to run roughshod over Congress or ignore the constraints of the federal courts. But he has been able to inflict extensive damage on our political institutions and public culture. He has used his power to aggravate, rather than calm, the fault lines that have divided our country.\nHis \u201cwall\u201d government shutdown is the latest example of his misuse of executive power. To end this essentially pointless standoff of his own making, he is exploring the use of national emergency powers to build a wall Congress and a majority of the public don\u2019t want.\nThe Trump administration has provided a new example of an old concept: the \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d That term, famously used by the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1973 to describe the excesses and abuses of the Nixon White House, fell out of use almost as soon as President Richard Nixon fell from grace. The reckoning of Watergate and the first-ever resignation of a president seemed to show that the executive branch was not as uncontrollable as it had once seemed.\nCongress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.\nThe National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president\u2019s power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.\nDespite these reforms, four decades later, the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?\nThe most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.\nSince the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one\u2019s own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.\nRepublicans have done much in the same vein, in moments of divided and united government alike. Republicans have also gone a step further to protect the party\u2019s electoral interests through the use of, for instance, strict voter-ID laws.\nAggressive presidents also depend on a partisan media to do their work without too much pushback. President Trump has demonstrated how this could be turned into a powerful tool for the White House. Mr. Trump has routinely repeated stories seen on the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning program and leaned on conservative cable hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs for advice as well. Indeed, the line between the Trump White House and conservative media outlets has become blurred beyond recognition. The former CNBC host Larry Kudlow now serves as head of the National Economic Council, while the former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Heather Nauert has been nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Bill Shine, a former executive at Fox News, now runs the White House Communications Office.\nThe imperial presidency is, in many ways, propped up by media partisans who insist that the naked emperor has glorious new clothes.\nMr. Trump has revealed that the president can act \u201cimperially\u201d because norms matter as much as rules and procedure. The reformers of the 1970s missed the ways in which reforms simply cannot restrain a president who doesn\u2019t care about institutions. The most important source of presidential restraint has been the character of the person in office.\nFor all his flaws, Mr. Nixon was unwilling to tear down the government to save himself. Mr. Trump has revealed that when a president is willing to cross what seemed to be clear lines, no one is there to hold him back.\nWith Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the Mueller investigation seemingly coming to a conclusion as well, Mr. Trump will likely be held to account, in one form or another. But it\u2019s important to remember that the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d will outlive any one president unless more is done to institute real checks and balances on the office itself.\nCongress has the most effective means of putting new limits on the White House through oversight. Many of the tools that Congress needs are right in front of it \u2014 holding serious hearings about the material in a Mueller report or making sure that legislation like the National Emergency Act is enforced \u2014 but it must use them.\nIf Mr. Trump invokes emergency power to build a wall, Congress needs to respond by passing legislation that will take back some of the power it granted in 1976.\nMost important, reforming presidential power will fall on the shoulders of voters. In the end, the most effective check on presidential power is to elect presidents who will exercise their authority with some restraint and respect our democratic institutions. That is the choice voters will have in 2020.\nKevin M. Kruse and Julian E.

Rosenstein, a lifelong Republican with a tough-on-crime record, was eager to put his stamp on the Justice Department when he was sworn in as the deputy attorney general in the early months of the Trump administration.\nInstead, he was abruptly thrust into a political maelstrom after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director only two weeks later. Mr. Rosenstein appointed a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s election interference and spent the next year and a half defending that inquiry from both Mr. Trump\u2019s unwavering attacks and attempted political intrusion by his congressional allies.\nNow Mr. Rosenstein plans to step down as the United States\u2019 No. 2 law enforcement official after Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, William P. Barr, is confirmed, three administration officials said on Wednesday. Senators could vote to confirm him as early as next month.\nMr. Barr will represent a new chapter for the Justice Department and for the Russia investigation, which is nearing its final stages and is expected to be finished in the coming weeks or months, according to senior law enforcement officials. They cautioned that like any investigation, it could be prolonged if the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III, were to cover uncover new evidence central to his mandate.\nMr. Barr, who met with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of his confirmation hearing next week, holds a dim view of aspects of the investigation but affirmed that he would allow it to conclude, said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\u201cHe says Bob Mueller is a great guy \u2014 ethical, professional,\u201d Mr. Graham said of Mr. Barr in a brief interview. \u201cHe believes that he is not on a witch hunt, trusts him to be fair to the president and the country, and has no reason to believe he is not going to do that.\u201d\nThe timing of Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s anticipated departure was unconnected to the Mueller investigation, a Trump administration official said. Mr. Rosenstein privately told Mr. Barr weeks ago that a term of roughly two years seemed like the right length, according to Mr. Graham.\nAfter Jeff Sessions\u2019s time as attorney general was done, Mr. Rosenstein was supportive of the decision to replace him with Mr. Barr, according to a person who has discussed the issue with Mr. Rosenstein. He and Mr. Barr worked together at the Justice Department during the George Bush administration.\nWhile most deputy attorneys general labor in obscurity, Mr. Rosenstein became a target of criticism from the president and his allies while liberals cheered his efforts to shield the Russia investigation from Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol. He was given standing ovations at many of his speeches last year and was feted on late-night television. Strangers would ask him for his autograph and for photographs with him at airports and in other public places.\nBut his record on the Russia investigation was more complicated. In the tumultuous days after the president fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, Mr. Rosenstein was shaken and angry, concerned that the White House had used him to justify the firing, associates have said.\nIn meetings with senior law enforcement officials, he suggested secretly taping his conversations with Mr. Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office, according to people familiar with the discussions and a memo written by Andrew McCabe, then the deputy F.B.I. director.\nMr. Rosenstein ultimately sought to stem the chaos by appointing Mr. Mueller as special counsel, but he consulted almost no one, according to three department officials who were not authorized to discuss the appointment.\nLater, his work to protect the Mueller investigation from Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional allies, whom Democrats accused of trying to subvert sensitive investigations, also drew criticism. To mollify the lawmakers, Mr. Rosenstein made scores of documents related to those inquiries available, moves that ran counter to law enforcement\u2019s reticence to share information about investigations.\nSenior law enforcement officials noted that under Mr. Rosenstein, the department won one of its most critical battles with conservative lawmakers who had sought the declassification of a wiretap application at the heart of the Russia inquiry. Despite congressional Republicans\u2019 urging, the White House declined to release the document.\n\u201cRod was in a truly unusual position and was largely a steady hand,\u201d said Megan L. Brown, a lawyer at the firm Wiley Rein who worked at the Justice Department with Mr. Rosenstein under President George W. Bush.\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard Law School, Mr. Rosenstein had worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years before becoming deputy attorney general. Early on, he was a trial lawyer in Washington and later was the United States attorney for Maryland under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.\nHe ascended to his post eager to help Mr. Sessions crack down on violent crime and drug trafficking and became known for the long hours he kept while running the day-to-day work of the Justice Department, sometimes sending emails at 3 a.m., according to two lawyers who worked closely with him.\nInside the department, law enforcement officials said Mr. Rosenstein helped usher in the sort of tough-on-crime policies that he supported during his 12 years as the top federal prosecutor in Maryland. He also paid special attention to the nation\u2019s federal prosecutors, some of whom said they felt neglected during past administrations.\nMr. Rosenstein has been at the forefront of Trump administration efforts to crack down on Chinese spying while also tightening rules and cracking down on department employees who provide information to the news media to inform the public.\nHe had an uneven relationship with Mr. Trump almost from the start. Though the president blamed Mr. Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, for the appointment of a special counsel, Mr. Trump also attacked Mr. Rosenstein repeatedly, calling him \u201cconflicted\u201d in one instance because Mr. Rosenstein had recommended Mr. Comey\u2019s firing but installed Mr. Mueller.\nThe relationship was tested in September after The New York Times revealed Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s questioning in May 2017 of Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness to be president and offers to secretly record conversations with him. Mr. Rosenstein has denied that account.\nRattled and unsure how the president would react, Mr. Rosenstein considered quitting and even had aides draft a news release about his resignation. But senior White House advisers urged him to stay on, and, over time, he and the president, who meet or speak by telephone frequently, found common ground.\nIt almost certainly helps that he is no longer the top law enforcement official overseeing the Mueller investigation. After the holidays last month, Mr. Rosenstein and his family visited Mr. Trump at the White House to meet the president and have a photograph taken with him.\nHis uneasy standing with Mr. Trump is not lost on him. At a conference last month where the president was to appear later, Mr. Rosenstein joked: \u201cYou let the president know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.\u201d\nReporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos, Adam Goldman, Michael S.

Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.\nYou write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that\u2019s the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn\u2019t include the two to three hours I use WeChat\u2019s web version.\nI\u2019m not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people\u2019s lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.\nSo as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I\u2019ll always be on top of what\u2019s going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren\u2019t so busy.\nBy now, some readers must be screaming, \u201cHow about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?\u201d Sadly, it\u2019s just the way of life in China. I\u2019m not trying to make light of the issue. I\u2019ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance.\nI\u2019ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven\u2019t had much success.\nI also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don\u2019t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs.\nBut Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That\u2019s where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.\nHow do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?\nThe first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.\nBecause of WeChat\u2019s prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there\u2019s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become \u201cfriends.\u201d I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it\u2019s a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.\nMany businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don\u2019t know how they manage so many contacts.\nGenerally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mantra. Many people in China\u2019s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.\nWhy are mobile wallets so popular in China?\nWhen I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn\u2019t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming.\nThen came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.\nMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I\u2019ve been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven\u2019t found an occasion to use it. Everybody \u2014 hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands \u2014 takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment.\nWhat are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?\nThe hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it\u2019s \u201ca quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u2018Carpool Karaoke.\u2019\u201d\nTo be honest, I\u2019m too old for the app \u2014 Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings \u2014 and have not spent much time on it. But I\u2019ve seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users\u2019 viewing history.\nThe short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin\u2019s rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d of China. It\u2019s where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.\nOutside of work, what tech product are you into right now?\nI\u2019m a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I don\u2019t use many other electronics. I didn\u2019t own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and it\u2019s the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.\nMy biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese government\u2019s demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Food Inspections\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration has stopped routine food safety inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and many other foods at high risk of contamination because of the federal government\u2019s shutdown, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the agency\u2019s commissioner, said on Wednesday.\nF.D.A. inspectors normally examine operations at about 160 domestic manufacturing and food processing plants each week. Nearly one-third of them are considered to be at high risk of causing food-borne illnesses. Food-borne diseases in the United States send about 128,000 people to the hospital each year, and kill 3,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDomestic meat and poultry are still being inspected by staff at the Agriculture Department, but they are going without pay. The F.D.A. oversees about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s food supply, as well as most overseas imports.\nIn a series of tweets, Dr. Gottlieb said he was taking steps to restore food safety surveillance inspections and to cover more of the high-risk sites as the shutdown continued. He said he hoped to bring back about 150 inspectors who had been furloughed during the shutdown, perhaps as early as next week.\nDr. Gottlieb said he was still trying to figure out how that could be achieved. \u201cThese are people who are now furloughed and can collect unemployment insurance or take a second job,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we pull them in and tell them they have to work, they can\u2019t collect. I have to make sure I\u2019m not imposing an undue hardship.\u201d\nFood safety advocates said they were worried that outbreaks would not be prevented without inspections, or would not be caught at the earliest warning signs.\n\u201cThese are inspections where they catch issues before people get sick,\u201d said Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. \u201cThe announcement that they are going to try to start up high-risk inspections is a positive step. But, we\u2019ve had outbreaks from foods that are not high risk \u2014 from flour, from packaged foods. So I think that the fact that two-thirds of establishments are not going to be inspected is still a problem.\u201d\nThe F.D.A. inspects food companies for bugs, rodents, mishandled food, improper preparation and other hazards.\nDr. Gottlieb said that inspections of overseas products have continued, despite the furloughs. He also said that the agency has maintained surveillance of some domestic producers who have had a history of problems or pose risks for other reasons.\nSoon after the shutdown began, the F.D.A. gave inspectors access to a central expense account so they could continue traveling while avoiding large personal credit card bills without knowing when the government would reimburse them.\nThe agency, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, is not dependent on federal funding for all of its activities. It receives much of its support from user fees imposed on the pharmaceutical, medical device, generic drug and other industries it regulates.\nAlthough about 41 percent of the staff is now furloughed because the agency had not received its federal appropriations before the shutdown, those in jobs supported by user fees have remained at work. But even those departments have taken a hit, as the F.D.A. has had to shift priorities for some duties.\nIn the pharmaceutical section, for example, some officials who generally consider pending drug applications are now working on post-market surveillance, checking for adverse events, like unexpected side effects of drugs or other problems.\n\u201cWe have a deep concern about those employees who were furloughed, their inability to fulfill their public health functions, and the tremendous personal impact that it has on them,\u201d said Ladd Wiley, executive director of the Alliance for a Stronger F.D.A., a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cWe are also grateful to the roughly 10,000 employees who are retained and working.\u201d\nBut, Mr. Wiley added, his organization also was concerned about nonemergency functions that the F.D.A. has had to put aside. Among the important work being delayed right now, he noted, are manufacturing inspections, technical assistance and advice to the produce industry \u2014 especially guidance for preventing contamination \u2014 and activity related to food additives.\n\u201cThere is a whole list of things that are not getting done,\u201d he said.\nSome public health experts were worried about the impact of the shutdown on inspection of fish. Andrew Rosenberg, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he was concerned about contaminated shellfish ending up on store shelves during the shutdown.\nIn particular, he said, consumers should watch out for clams, mussels, oysters and other bivalves that may come from contaminated water. \u201cIt can be very nasty stuff,\u201d said Dr. Rosenberg, a former official with the seafood inspection program run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cIt can be anything from E. coli to Vibrio. It is important for people to look for an inspection certificate.\u201d\nHe noted that the NOAA website says the inspectors are working without pay; so are meat and poultry inspectors, according to the Department of Agriculture. Michael Halpern, deputy director of the science and democracy center, thinks that\u2019s a problem not just for the workers but for consumers if the furloughed inspectors turn to temporary jobs to support themselves, creating a shortage.\n\u201cWe have food outbreaks even during normal times, and if the agency is stretched even thinner, it can\u2019t cover much ground,\u201d he said.\nOne of the most prominent food-borne illness outbreaks recently involved romaine lettuce. In an odd bit of timing, the C.D.C. issued a statement on Wednesday noting that the latest spate of problems from contaminated romaine began in October, sickening 62 people in 16 states and the District of Columbia.\nThe C.D.C. and the F.D.A. traced some of the contamination back to Adam Brothers Farming in Santa Barbara County, Calif., citing E. coli traced to an agricultural reservoir there. The F.D.A. issued a separate statement saying that it would continue to investigate the source, even though the C.D.C. has declared the outbreak to be over.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Last year, it became the subject of the second season of Slate\u2019s \u201cSlow Burn\u201d podcast, and the events were also considered for an installment of Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d series. (The creator reconsidered.) On Thursday night, however, a two-hour special on ABC takes a closer look at the scandal, including hours of phone calls Linda Tripp secretly recorded between herself and Lewinsky, who was then a White House intern. The special also features surveillance material and recordings gathered by the special counsel, and excerpts from Barbara Walters\u2019s 1999 interview with Lewinsky. The \u201cTruth and Lies\u201d series has delved into true crimes like the Menendez brothers murders and the Jonestown massacre.\nTHE GOOD PLACE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. Since the show\u2019s midseason finale last month, the only high jinks we\u2019ve gotten to see from the \u201cGood Place\u201d gang came during the Golden Globes, when Jameela Jamil, who plays Tahani on the show, was hilariously misnamed \u201cKamilah Al-Jamil,\u201d her one-upping onscreen sister, in a title card on the E! red-carpet preshow. But on Thursday fans will finally get to see the group reunited in what appears to be the honest-to-goodness Good Place.\nWhat\u2019s Streaming\nLODGE 49 on Hulu. Sunday night\u2019s Golden Globe Awards celebrated what the Hollywood Foreign Press Association deemed the best of film and television, but many shows that hit the small screen in 2018 may have been overlooked. One such series, which The New York Times named one of the best on TV last year, was AMC\u2019s \u201cLodge 49,\u201d which follows the misadventures of a down-and-out surfer, Dud (Wyatt Russell), who, moneyless, jobless and unapologetically aimless, somehow winds up finding purpose in a fraternal lodge that is home to eccentric Californians like himself. The Times critic James Poniewozik named the show a Critic\u2019s Pick, and said, \u201cFalling into \u2018Lodge 49\u2019 is like hanging out at an oddball dive bar that you ignored the instinct to keep walking past.\u201d The first season is available to stream on Hulu, and is available on Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play and Vudu.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Huawei has denied that it spies for Beijing.\nBut American counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors have investigated the company on national security grounds for years. And in August, a judge in New York issued a warrant for Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest on charges of bank fraud. According to Canadian officials, the United States has accused Ms. Meng of tricking banks into carrying out transactions involving Huawei-controlled entities that violated American sanctions on Iran.\nCanada, where Ms. Meng was arrested on Dec. 1 while changing planes, has found itself caught in the middle of a clash between the countries with the world\u2019s biggest economies.\nLess than a week after the Canadian government announced Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, China detained two Canadian citizens, accusing them of undermining Chinese national security. The Chinese authorities have not elaborated on their reasons for holding the men: Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman. But the detentions were viewed by many as an effort to seek leverage in negotiations over Ms. Meng\u2019s fate.\nThe standoff escalated after a third Canadian was held in China, on accusations of working without a valid visa. In late December, a Chinese court also ordered the retrial of a Canadian man on a drug-smuggling charge. Prosecutors argued that his original 15-year prison sentence had been too light.\nMs. Meng has been released on bail by a Canadian court, and is living under surveillance in one of her homes in Vancouver, British Columbia. Canadian legal authorities will decide whether she should be extradited to the United States; Beijing has called for her immediate release.\n\u201cIt seems that, to some people, only Canadian citizens shall be treated in a humanitarian manner and their freedom deemed valuable, while Chinese people do not deserve that,\u201d Mr. Lu wrote in his op-ed.\nThe ambassador also said that people in the West had applied double standards in their treatment of Huawei itself. Canadians, he wrote, have \u201cconveniently ignored\u201d revelations about global surveillance activities by the United States and its allies.\n\u201cSomething is considered as \u2018safeguarding national security\u2019 when it is done by Western countries,\u201d Mr. Lu wrote. \u201cBut it is termed \u2018conducting espionage\u2019 when done by China.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The agency officially concluded\nlast month, in its 1999 Report to Congress on Self-Regulation and\nPrivacy, that voluntary industry practices were working just fine and that \"no legislative action is necessary at this time.\"\nThis summation came despite comments from one FTC commissioner, Sheila F. Anthony, who said in a written statement to a Senate subcommittee in July that she was dismayed by the results of studies that show a gap as large as\n89 percent between the number of sites that gather personal information and those that post substantive privacy policies. Self-regulation \"is not enough if the privacy practices themselves are toothless,\" wrote\nMs. Anthony, who dissented in part from last month's report.\nMore recently, a telephone industry posse, led by U S West, persuaded a federal appeals court in Denver to reverse some recent FCC rules that had been specifically designed to protect private customer data.\nAccording to the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, William E. Kennard, who said the agency would appeal the decision, those rules were the result of a request by Congress to provide \"meaningful protection\nfor consumers' privacy rights.\"\nThe FCC rules had required phone companies to get explicit permission from their customers -- a method known as \"opt in\" -- before using or sharing customers' records, calling patterns and other personal information\nto market new services to them.\n\"You call your doctor, your clergyman, your therapist,\" Kennard said. \"You order products. And when you pick up that telephone, most consumers have no earthly idea that call might be used by someone to market\nanother service to them. When you pick up that telephone, you should have ownership of that information. It's the way we live our lives and it's private to us.\"\nBut in a 2-1 ruling published on Aug. 18, which has obvious implications for the data-hungry Internet economy, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that rules protecting consumers from having information like the numbers\nthey call and the services they subscribe to used without their permission interfered with the phone companies' First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\"Although we may feel uncomfortable knowing that our personal information is circulating in the world,\" the ruling said, \"we live in an open society where information may pass freely.\"\nOne wonders how many circuit court judges would be willing to have the form and substance of their phone bills \"pass freely\" among the employees of U S West or its partners.\nThe court's decision does not allow U S West and others to sell proprietary customer data to outsiders, but it does give the telephone companies permission to scrutinize this highly personal data -- data gathered only\nas a byproduct of subscribing to their services -- without the subscribers' explicit permission. Not incidentally, it gives the companies an enormous edge over others selling competing services.\nKennard said he was disappointed that the court came down on the side of the business interests of telephone companies. \"If that's the way privacy laws will be interpreted,\" he said, \"then I think consumers\nwill have a lot to worry about.\"\nOddly enough, the ruling -- which, if it stands, would seem to hamper any future attempts to limit the ability of companies to disclose consumers' personal information -- got very little play in the national news media.\nCertainly, the victorious companies -- U S West, Vodaphone Airtouch, Sprint, SBC Communications, MCI Worldcom, Bell South and Frontier -- did little to call attention to the ruling.\nAnd who can blame them? Consumers do not like it when companies do not protect their privacy, as Amazon.com found out this week when it started publishing lists of its products purchased by specific companies, nonprofit groups\nand government agencies. But refusing to flaunt data mining and refusing to practice it are two different matters. \"The technology generates a lot of information that's very valuable, and everybody wants to get\ntheir hands on it,\" says David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington.\nSobel does not buy the \"corporate First Amendment\" argument that he said won the day for U S West et al. \"We do, in fact, have existing federal laws that restrict companies from disclosing personal information,\nlike video rentals,\" he said. \"It's not a violation of free speech rights to forbid people to divulge inside information. Why should it be a violation to pass laws restricting the use of private data?\"\nAnd Kennard said he saw a broader issue around the collection of detailed consumer data in every transaction from the supermarket scanner to the credit-card number on the Internet. \"As a society, we have to come up with\na way of protecting that information for benefit of consumers,\" he said. \"It doesn't necessarily mean that government has to do it, but government is certainly a logical place for it to be done if industry\nisn't going to step up to the plate.\"\nMs. Anthony, the FTC commissioner, has also become a believer in a government role. In her statement to the Senate subcommittee, she wrote that \"industry progress has been far too slow\" since the FTC encouraged voluntary\nfair information practices in 1996. \"I believe that the time is ripe for federal legislation to establish at least baseline minimum standards upon which meaningful self-regulation can flourish.\"\nAnd despite their protests, that may be the only \"no\" that industry will understand.\nClick here for a list of links to other Digital Commerce columns.\nRelated Sites\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Nearly 80,000 people died in the United States.\nThe number of deaths from flu this season has not yet been determined. But Dr. Fry said the flu was widespread in 30 states, especially in the Southeast, and is moving northward. Levels are also high in New York City and New Jersey.\nAnd the number of hospitalizations so far this season \u201cis a reminder that flu can cause severe illness,\u201d Dr. Fry added.\nDespite the warnings, many people still do not realize how dangerous the flu can be. The death last month of Bre Payton, 26, a writer for a conservative online newsmagazine and a guest commentator on the Fox News Channel, came as a shock to many. She died after becoming ill with the flu and developing encephalitis, a brain inflammation.\nThe very young, the very old, pregnant women and people with underlying health problems have the highest risk of becoming seriously ill and needing hospitalization for the flu, according to the C.D.C. In healthy people, the sickness usually lasts three to five days, but the cough can linger.\n[What parents need to know about this flu season]\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not too late to get vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Fry said.\nThe vaccine needs about two weeks to take effect, she said, but is still worth getting because the flu season is expected to drag on longer than that. The effectiveness of this year\u2019s vaccine is not known yet, but in past years, Dr. Fry said, vaccination against the same type of flu that is now circulating \u2014 known as H1N1 \u2014 was about 50 percent to 60 percent effective at reducing the likelihood of a person needing to visit the doctor with symptoms.\nAntiviral drugs, available by prescription only, can shorten the illness slightly and lessen its severity, but they work best if taken as early as possible after symptoms appear. In a statement, the C.D.C. said, \u201cPeople who are very sick or who are at high risk of serious flu complications and get flu symptoms should see a health care provider quickly for possible treatment with a flu antiviral drug.\u201d\nAlthough influenza has already caused deaths this season, the figure has not been released because there is not enough information yet to make a reliable estimate, said Carrie Reed, who led the applied research and modeling team that produced the estimates.\nNor is it possible to determine how this flu season compares with others based on these numbers, as this is the first time that the C.D.C. has provided flu estimates while the season is still underway. In the past, the totals were released after the flu season had ended.\nDr. Fry said her team had decided to gather and report the numbers early because they realized that people found the data useful. From now on, updated totals will be published every Friday in the C.D.C.\u2019s weekly FluView report.\nEven though flu viruses contain only eight genes, compared with about 20,000 in humans, they manage to wreak a great deal of havoc. During the last flu season, from 2017 to 2018, about 48.8 million people caught the illness, 22.7 million saw a doctor, 959,000 were hospitalized and 79,400 died. The number of cases last season was the highest since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, when 60 million people got sick.\nDr. Fry said it was not possible to use the current estimates to project what the total number of cases might be this season.\n\u201cWe are very actively pursuing methods to forecast what could be happening in the short term and when the season might peak,\u201d Dr. Fry said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know for several more weeks whether it\u2019s peaked.\u201d\nThe estimates are based on data collected from a surveillance network that counts flu-related hospitalizations in parts of 13 states scattered around the country, covering about 27 million people, or 8.5 percent of the nation\u2019s population.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

From the crossing between San Ysidro in San Diego and El Chaparral in Tijuana, one can see earlier, less foreboding iterations of the wall, like the one signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.\nDay 42\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nDay 42\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZ.\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nIn the years since, the wall has been added to, adjusted and amplified \u2014 a living testament of sorts to the enduring and often political nature of wall-building along the border.\nOn the immigration issue, Tijuana has long been a hot spot of political and media attention, a sort of stand-in for the border writ large, however mistaken the idea.\nAnd it was no different on a recent visit.\nThanks to the arrival in the city of thousands of migrants, traveling in caravans for safe passage from Central America, and because of the hectoring focus of President Trump, Tijuana has attracted the bulk of attention.\nIt has become the flash point and symbol for all that is happening along the border: the supposed chaos, the real desperation and the political crisis that has both bound and distanced the governments of the United States and Mexico.\nAnd so it was on a recent Friday that dozens of journalists, lawyers and aid workers gathered in the concrete plaza just outside the Tijuana crossing, waiting for the latest chapter in the border crisis to unfold.\nIn an awkwardly coordinated effort, the American and Mexican governments had announced that they would start a \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program.\nThe policy was aimed at forcing asylum seekers to the United States to return to Mexico while they awaited a decision on their application.\nThe decision was sudden, and for migrants, devastating.\nHaving endured the trek north, through routes brimming with thieves and smugglers, the migrants found that the road to asylum in the United States would end, for now, in Mexico.\nThe United States applauded what it called a binational effort.\nMexican officials insisted, however, that the plan was forced on them and that they had no say in the matter, but that they would take the asylum seekers back in the spirit of humanitarianism.\nThose gathered to respond to the ramifications of the deal \u2014 reporters to cover it, along with lawyers and activists to offer counsel and assistance \u2014 filled the plaza in tribal clusters and waited for a returnee to pass back through the gates, which would be a repudiation of decades of asylum practices in the United States.\nInstead, the only thing that passed through the crowd was rumor.\nSomeone heard that the first returnee was due at any moment. Within seconds, a line of journalists staged themselves in front of the exit. A family approached, carrying suitcases and small bags. They paused to look at the phalanx of journalists, then passed without a word. They were not the returnees.\nAs the crowd waited for someone to come back, white vans were lined up in a parking lot, preparing to take another set of migrants across to apply for asylum.\nVolunteer aid workers stood pressed against the white metal bars, whispering goodbyes and shedding tears.\nThey grew hostile as journalists took pictures, with a few of the volunteers shouting at the photographers to stop. These were asylum seekers under threat, the volunteers said, and they could be endangered if their image surfaced in the media.\nWhen that request didn\u2019t work, the volunteers began sticking their hands in front of cameras to block them. A few tugged at camera straps. A Mexican journalist took issue with an American activist.\n\u201cI have a right to do this,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI\u2019m following the law, in my country. When I\u2019m in your country, I\u2019ll follow the law there. But don\u2019t tell me how to act in my country.\u201d\nHis aggressor recoiled, and then claimed the high ground. She told the crowd she was prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the migrants, who seemed to have no problem at all with the journalists taking pictures and asking questions.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a black eye if I have to,\u201d she announced, although the threat she seemed to be describing wasn\u2019t immediately apparent. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to, but it\u2019s worth it to protect these people.\u201d\nThe standoff continued for a few more minutes, until the vans had loaded everyone up and driven away.\nThe knot of journalists and activists loosened, and eventually, with no sign of any returnees, everyone left.\nFour days later, the first returnee, a bleary-eyed Honduran man worn from his multiday ordeal, would pass back into Mexico. Upon entry, he was whisked away by Mexican officials before he could be interviewed.\nIf theatricality has become a reality along the border here, one could argue that Mr. Trump is its full-time producer.\nThe language of crisis and chaos, however unfounded, has prompted a wave of coverage, especially in the United States.\nIn Mexico, forcing migrants to wait months to cross and apply for asylum has left thousands in a state of man-made crisis.\nSome leave. Others find work in Mexico and wait for better days, or cross illegally elsewhere. A few have attempted to rush the wall, only to be beaten back with tear gas.\nThose images can lend credence to the border-as-chaos plotline \u2014 that the United States is under threat and that only walls and deterrence can protect it. That anyone, if given the chance, would gladly sneak across to make a new life in the United States.\nBut where the border comes to its western end, where the wall dives into the Pacific Ocean and its barnacled stanchions split the crashing surf, another image prevails.\nOn the United States side, the beach is abandoned, undeveloped, barren. In the distance, San Diego is barely discernible in the evening haze.\nThe entire beachfront on the Mexico side pulses with life. The portraits of misery and desperation give way to a Friday on the beach in Tijuana.\nA child runs in circles on the damp sand, screaming with delight as a small dog chases close behind. A group of hippies dance in a drum circle. Young couples saunter down to the water\u2019s edge to snap selfies in front of the wall.\nMusic rains down from the short bluffs overhead, as restaurants and bars begin to fill.

The Trump administration opted for the most severe approach.\n\u201cThe cases are on their surface about wilderness, but I think sitting in the courtroom and watching the trial really laid bare the fact that it\u2019s not just about wilderness,\u201d said Parker Deighan, one of the volunteers awaiting trial on a misdemeanor charge in the case. \u201cIt is about targeting humanitarian aid and targeting care for folks who cross the border.\u201d\nIn convicting the activists, a federal judge said their actions had eroded \u201cthe national decision to maintain the refuge in its pristine nature.\u201d And \u201cpristine\u201d is a word that could be easily applied to much of the border area. Tracts of ridged desert populated by barrel cactus and giant saguaros that hug the skyline are untouched reservation land for 75 miles of the border.\nAnd yet a wall could be coming. This despite the fact that one already exists.\nThe government\u2019s action against the activists, whatever the legal merit, raises broader questions along the border, in particular here, where Arizona abuts its Mexican counterpart, Sonora.\nAmong them: Who exactly owns the land and gets to say what can or cannot be done to it? Who can make permanent man\u2019s touch on the wilderness, and who suffers for it?\nA short drive from Cabeza Prieta lie lands held by the people of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, which the tribe has occupied for centuries. Here, the trammeling of the land has been authored exclusively by the American government in its campaign to seal off the dry edges of the United States.\n\u201cIt is sort of a contradiction what they are doing here,\u201d Verlon Jose, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation vice chairman, said on a recent tour through a section of the nearly three million acres granted to the tribe. \u201cNo one wants this wall, and they are saying they are going to build it anyways.\u201d\nThe tribe has occupied the land for thousands of years, since before there were countries to separate with borders. Its land once stretched from central Arizona all the way down to Hermosillo, Mexico, but geopolitics forced a retreat.\nToday, the tribe is fighting to preserve what\u2019s left. Mr. Jose and others are in a pitched battle to halt the construction of any more walls on their land, which is a wilderness in all but name, replete with saguaro forests, untamed brush and tracts of desert arroyo and washes that flood every spring.\nThe wall that exists now is a welded chain of X-barriers that form a straight line across the southern edge of Tohono O\u2019odham land. To the side, a dirt road has been scratched out of the plains.\nThis was, to many on the reservation, already a sore point.\nMore than 2,000 members of the tribe are registered in Mexico. Graveyards sit across the fencing in place now, accessible through a few unmanned border gates exclusively for tribe members.\nA new wall would upend nature entirely \u2014 from the unspoiled views across a landscape indifferent to borders to the animal life whose free passage between sides would end.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our backyard,\u201d said Mr. Jose. \u201cThere\u2019s not just the physical effect of a wall. It\u2019s psychological and emotional as well.\u201d\nBOQUILLAS DEL CARMEN, Mexico \u2014 The land here is indifferent to division, heeding no borders as nature claims both sides in its staggering sweep.\nThe limestone cliffs soaring 1,500 feet over the banks of the Rio Grande are mirror images of one another on either side of the Texas and Mexico divide.

The boats that ferried tourists across the river had stopped. Two restaurants that opened to serve a nascent industry were shuttered, for the moment.\n\u201cThe shutdown came in our peak season,\u201d said Veronica Ureste, 32, a lifelong resident of Boquillas del Carmen, who sells artisanal products to tourists. She was standing in her kitchen as driving rain pelted her roof and intensified a general feeling of gloom. \u201cWe work during this tourist season to survive for the whole year.\u201d\nSurvival has been a relatively constant state of being for the people of Boquillas, which is nestled along a low bluff and is five hours from the nearest big town by alternating patches of paved and dirt road.\nUntil tourism came along following the reopening of the river crossing in recent years, people were abandoning their homes to find opportunities elsewhere.\nAcross the now-impassable river, Big Bend National Park, which sweeps over the southern edge of Texas to the banks of the Rio Grande, felt similarly forlorn amid a monthlong, partial government shutdown.\nTraffic had slowed there, too. Cars seldom pass. Campgrounds sit empty. On the most popular trails, tourists who made plans months earlier trudged through the natural habitat, equally frustrated and thrilled by the solitude.\nPhyllis and John Brewster were up early, hiking the Santa Elena Canyon in the sunless morning chill with a handful of other visitors. Mrs. Brewster glanced toward Mexico, and at the sheer rock wall that marked its start.\nNot much happening on that side, from what she could see.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a natural boundary,\u201d said Mrs. Brewster, 76, a retired elementary schoolteacher from Grosse Pointe, Mich., as she made her way up a walkway etched into the cliffs. \u201cWhat the heck do you need a wall for?\u201d\nMr. Brewster, a retired veterinarian and lifelong Republican, stood quietly, staring out over the flood plain and the narrow river at its center.\n\u201cThe migrants ought to know about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to cross the river.\u201c\nMr. Brewster wasn\u2019t an obvious opponent of the current administration\u2019s border policy. He voted for Donald J. Trump in 2016, a revelation that surprised even his wife. At the time, he said, couldn\u2019t bring himself to go with a Democrat.\nNow, more than two years on, the scandals, the nativist language and the vitriol are just too much for him. He said he hated that none of his fellow Republicans seem willing to do anything about it. And he hates what he sees as the demonization of migrants trying to reach the United States.\nAnd now, here he was, in a nearly empty and unattended national park, bereft of personnel to police the border. Even the weather seemed intransigent \u2014 a dense fog refused to lift, practically plugging the canyon shut.\nThe Brewsters did missionary work in Central America. They knew people there, he said. Good people.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty to close down a country,\u201d he said, shaking his head slowly. \u201cThese people are escaping serious problems for a better life. All of our ancestors were immigrants at one point. To do this is a sinful act.\u201d\nPIEDRAS NEGRAS, Mexico \u2014 Stripped to their underwear, the small group of boys stood shivering on one of the bridge\u2019s footings, pausing in the bitter cold to reconsider their crossing.\nThey were nearly halfway across the Rio Grande, headed for Eagle Pass, Tex. Their clothes lay in a soggy pile to one side of them, discarded to reduce the drag on their remaining swim to the other side, where United States Customs and Border Protection agents lined the banks of the river waiting for them.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 14,\nPiedras Negras\nCOAHUILA\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nDay 14,\nPiedras Negras\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nCOAHUILA\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nBorder patrol airboats circled nearby, passing beneath the bridge as the boys \u2014 most of them teenagers from Honduras \u2014 pondered whether to return to the frigid water.\nOn the Mexican side, people lined the riverfront esplanade to watch, quieted by the spectacle of despair. Locals pressed up against the hand railings to get a better look. So did migrants, who were not crossing with the boys but wished them well.\n\u201cThis is how you apply for asylum now,\u201d said Oscar Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a 21-year-old Honduran, bracing against the cold as he watched his countrymen\u2019s trip across the river. He was not going with them. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it across any other way.\u201d\nOnly one of the boys managed to reach the American side, in a final, frantic paddle. As soon as he reached the bank, he was gathered up by uniformed agents and whisked away in a S.U.V.\nThe other swimmers gave up, boarded the airboats and were brought back to the banks of Mexico, where they had started and where ambulances now waited.\nBefore a new border wall became the focal point of a bitter national debate in the United States, and the cause of what is now a monthlong partial government shutdown, most asylum seekers simply crossed the international footbridge that connects Eagle Pass with Piedras Negras. Migrants were allowed to enter, apply for asylum \u2014 and then wait for a decision.\nToday, border agents operate a checkpoint installed in the center of the bridge, which allows them to turn migrants back before they can enter United States territory.\nThis leaves migrants with few options.\nThey can go home, which few do, having come so far already. Or they can look for other ways across, often illegal ones.\nMexico is unsafe almost everywhere it touches the United States, and Piedras Negras, a city of about 165,000 people, is no exception, despite notching some recent improvements in security.\nOne asylum-seeking family from El Salvador was recently kidnapped here after it was turned away by United States agents, according to statements given to the American Civil Liberties Union. The family was forced to negotiate bribes to Mexican authorities before their release could be secured.\nIt then took lawyers from the A.C.L.U. accompanying the family members for a second attempt at asylum before they were successful and processed at the port of entry in El Paso, hundreds of miles away.\nMost asylum seekers do not have the luxury of legal assistance, subjected to the vagaries of a system unevenly, crudely and sometime cruelly applied. And as the Trump administration turns up the pressure, their desperation has only intensified .\nBut not their resolve.\nThe desperation differs from crossing point to crossing point, our journey along the border has found.\nIn some places, it's overcrowded migrant shelters. At others, its squalid encampments on bridges. Here in Piedras Negras, it\u2019s children screwing up the courage to plunge into the cold water and the swift currents.\nAnd yet the migrants continue arriving at the border every day, some from as far away as Cameroon, traversing half the globe to find a new life in the United States.\nBut this part of Mexico is a good reminder that not all border stories run from south to north.\nIn the town of M\u00fazquiz, a few dozen miles from the border at Piedras Negras, the members of the Kickapoo tribe reside on a reservation granted to them by the Mexican government more than 150 years ago. Fleeing the brutality of American soldiers and marauders of the Old West, the tribes members crossed south into Mexico for safety, where they stayed and preserved their traditions.\n\u201cThe border protected us,\u201d said Andres Aniko, the spiritual leader of the Kickapoo in the Mexican state of Coahuila. \u201cIt stopped the white man from coming over here.\u201d\nThe Kickapoo enjoy dual citizenship, and are allowed to cross the border without visas, though many are content to remain in Mexico.\n\u201cWe found peace here,\u201d Mr. Aniko said from the tribe\u2019s reservation, which is largely off limits to outsiders. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons we have been able to preserve our traditions. We were isolated here.\u201d\nNUEVO LAREDO, Mexico \u2013 Thirteen thousand trucks a day. A million dollars a minute.\nThat, on average, is the value of the cargo that crosses the border between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo on the United States-Mexico border.\nHere, between the two Laredos, the border is booming. Trucks loaded with everything from car parts to packaged food hum across a bridge that has been especially designated for commerce, making it the largest land port in the Americas.\n\u201cWe are the heart of Nafta,\u201d says Edgardo Pedraza, the head of the Customs Brokers Association in Nuevo Laredo, who insists on being called Gary. \u201cI think of the two sides as one Laredo.\u201d\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nDay 8,\nNuevo Laredo\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 8,\nNuevo Laredo\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nGary himself has dual nationality, and is married to an American citizen.

Children cross from Mexico to the United States to attend school. Workers cross, too, as do shoppers, who return with outlet mall bags at all hours of the day.\nThe two cities share a baseball team, and a history dating back a century and a half. Spanish is spoken on both sides, forging a cultural bond distinct to border towns.\nNeither side wants the wall. The river, for most, is border enough.\nBut even here, there is a stark difference in the freedom of movement of goods versus people.\nEvery day, hundreds of Mexicans, many with wives and children still living in the United States, are deported and dropped off in Nuevo Laredo.\n\u201cWe have grown so much with the United States in terms of trade, commerce and technology,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Carmona Flores, the head of the Tamaulipas Institute for Migrants, a state agency tasked with managing the return to Mexico of tens of thousands of migrants. \u201cBut we have never really been able to achieve this with the flow of people.\u201d\nMr. Carmona had just finished a welcome session for deported migrants, a class of largely men haggard from spending a varying number of weeks in detention on the American side.\nMr. Carmona spoke to them as a coach might to the players of a losing team. He told them they were special \u2013 not just anyone could make the passage north as they had done. They worked harder than most, clocking in 14-hour days in the United States, and Mexico needed them.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t work like you guys,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPeople may look at your tattoos, earrings or the way you walk and wonder what you\u2019re all about,\u201d he added, miming a tough-guy walk that elicited a round of laughter from the men.\n\u201cThe truth is, you guys are going to replace us, you work harder than we do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need you. We need you to lift this country up.\u201d\nA few faces crumpled, the men caught off guard by the kind words. One man began to weep. Afterward, Mr. Carmona sent them off to grab a meal before their bus trips back home.\n\u201cMost of them, when they return, it\u2019s their dignity that\u2019s suffered the most,\u201d he later explained. \u201cOur job is to lift them up and tell them how important they are, to respect the sacrifices they made.\u201d\nTo help them acclimate, Mr. Carmona called in a pair of executives from a trucking company to register anyone interested in a job. With a nationwide shortfall of more than 200,000 drivers, the company promised good wages, at least by Mexican standards.\nJust past the American customs checkpoint on the Texas side, a torpid groan fills the air as tractor-trailers ease past in quick succession, destined for states across America.\nDrivers queue on the raised surface of a traffic island, waiting for their rigs to clear the booth and for the start of their shifts.\n\u201cWe need the U.S. and the U.S. needs us, too,\u201d Jonathan Gamboa, a 29-year-old driver from Mexico, said one recent morning.\nMr. Gamboa accepts his place in the order of things: He has a visa that lets him transit through the United States, but not live there. He could make a good living driving on the American side, but that was it.\n\u201cEvery day the merchandise crosses and I cross with it,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cAnd I\u2019m O.K. with that.

Patches of mesquite, blackbrush and huisache crowd the horizon.\nLike the border itself, which lies some 80 miles away, it is an unwelcoming place for migrants.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nEND\nTijuana\nTEXAS\nDay 5,\nFalfurrias\nMEXICO\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nSTART\nBrownsville\nCALIF.\nNEW\nMEXICO\nARIZONA\nEND\nTEXAS\nTijuana\nDay 5,\nFalfurrias\nMEXICO\nSTART\nBrownsville\nPACIFIC\nOCEAN\nMore than 700 have perished in transit through Brooks County over the last 15 years, claimed by heat and dehydration while trying to find their way along the parched tracts of ranchland. The real number is surely higher. The local sheriff, Benny Martinez, thinks only one in five is ever found.\nMigrants disperse here after crossing into the United States, avoiding a border patrol checkpoint. They trek through the dried-out terrain, seeking shade under the boughs of live oaks. Hunters occasionally stumble across hats, empty water jugs and leathered remains banked against trees.\nIn spite of the risk, migrants continue to make the journey through the wilds of Brooks County year after year, carried along by hope. And every year, dozens die. No one believes his or her journey will end like this. They can't. Here, the dead do not teach the living.\nFor years, the remains were conveyed to the county cemetery in Falfurrias, then interred in the open space along its peripheries, often in plots too small or poorly located to sell.\nNo one is quite sure how many were buried; until 2013, the county kept no records.\nBut Eddie Canales, the founder of the South Texas Human Rights Center, has forced the remains into the open, hoping to rescue them from anonymity.\nSince 2013, anthropologists have been coming with their students to exhume the bodies and extract DNA samples. With no maps or records, they dig narrow trenches guided by the memories of local gravediggers. The samples are then cross-referenced with missing person databases.\nOf the more than 150 remains unearthed in this cemetery, 30 have been identified.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the families of the missing,\u201d said Kate Spradley, a forensic anthropologist from Texas State University overseeing the effort.\nDr. Spradley stood nearby as a team of students brushed the dirt away from a set of remains buried several feet deep. A worn trash bag, blistered by age, held the bleached bones stacked neatly inside.\nAbove that, packed into the soil, she spotted the faint traces of calcified bone poking through the grit. Another body. That made 16 exhumed in just under a week.\nThe bodies tell their own stories, Dr. Spradley explained. One man carried photocopied money in his pockets to throw off robbers. Others are buried with stuffed animals. Some are buried clothed; others as skeletons, having died long before they were found.\nEach new discovery brings conflicting emotions, a sense of satisfaction tempered by sorrow. She wonders if they will ever find all of the remains.\n\u201cYou look around and you just think, \u2018There\u2019s an open space, there\u2019s an open space,\u2019\u201d she said, scanning the verdant grounds, where fresh cut flowers lay against polished headstones. \u201cAnd there could be a migrant buried anywhere there.\u201d\nShe paused for a moment. The sound of shovels striking dirt filled the cemetery.\n\u201cI always think, you know, what if one of my family members went to another country and never came back,\u201d she said. \u201cWould anyone pick up the phone to help me? And if they picked up the phone, would they care enough to help me?\u201d\nFew did care here until 2013, when 130 bodies were found -- the largest number the county has ever recorded. It wasn\u2019t that 130 died that year, only that, whether because drought cleared out more brush or out of plain dumb chance, they found that many remains.\nThat was when Mr. Canales decided to come out of retirement to found the human rights center, after a career as a union organizer. A 70-year-old Texan with an easy laugh, he applied the same principles to human rights as he did to union organizing.\n\u201cDeveloping a connection, basically,\u201d he said, as he drove the public roads that demarcate thousands of acres of ranch land. \u201cAnd then, you know, I mean, I'm still the same pushy guy.\u201d\nMr. Canales was on his way to replenish water stations that he maintains for migrants passing through. A little more work for him might mean a little less for the gravediggers. The large blue bins sit along the roadside every half-mile or so, and carry up to six gallons of fresh water. He\u2019s planted a flag near most, to help migrants spot them from the brush.\nOccasionally, people steal the barrels or puncture them to deter migrants. Canales brushes this off. \u201cYou gotta be able to laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to do this work.\u201d\nIn the borderlands, of course, not everything is dark and serious. People live their lives as they do anywhere. Whatever the broader political debate, to most, this place is just home. And for some, it feels as though politicians who know little about the area are just trying to gain political points.\n\u201cThere\u2019s certainly no crisis or state of emergency here,\u201d said Phillip G\u00f3mez.\nMr. G\u00f3mez was seated at the Jalisco Restaurant along the edge of the highway into town. The television was on over the bar, playing the highlights of President Trump\u2019s speech in McAllen, Tex., about an hour and a half drive away.\nBut no one was paying attention to that. The D.J. was gearing up for karaoke night. Regulars began filing in, introducing themselves to diners as if they owned the place.\nMr. G\u00f3mez, a 64-year-old technician for DirecTV, sported a white handlebar mustache, plaid shirt and cowboy hat with a pair of sunglasses perched on top. He remained seated while he sang a slightly off-tune rendition of \u201cThe Chair\u201d by George Strait.\nAfterward, he didn\u2019t much care to talk politics, though he allowed that everyone else seemed to want to talk about the border whether they lived there or not.\nThen he talked about the border.\nHe agrees with Mr. Trump, he said, and though he feels bad for migrants fleeing violence, that\u2019s no reason to let everyone just come into the U.S.\n\u201cWhy do people have walls in their backyard?\u201d he asked, passing off the microphone for the second time that night, after a second George Strait song. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t want people in there. There\u2019s no difference. Explain the difference to me.\u201d\nMr. G\u00f3mez, who speaks Spanish and whose great-grandparents immigrated from Mexico, doesn\u2019t feel as if the system can bear much more.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for helping people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut too many people are going to bring down our system.\u201d\nBROWNSVILLE \u2014 There are no signs, markers or commemorations.

The border now bisected his life, with his wife and three children still in North Carolina.\nHe would cross again, he knew that much. Legally, if possible. If not, given the current impasse over the border and migration, a wall would not stop him.\n\u201cWe are going to cross one way or another,\u201d he said, offering an incongruous smile. \u201cI mean, we Mexicans have been doing that forever.\u201d\nJust over the bridge, in Brownsville, Tex., Narce G\u00f3mez sat behind the counter of a hierber\u00eda, a store offering tarot card readings, statuettes of saints, herbal remedies and candles.\nHer clientele is largely Mexican-American, a population whose predecessors carried their cultures with them across the border generations before.\nAnd perhaps that was the problem.

A 2017 national security strategy document called China a \u201crevisionist\u201d power attempting to reorder international politics to suit its interests. It\u2019s difficult to think otherwise given Beijing\u2019s military buildup, its attempts to undermine American influence and power, its retaliations against American allies such as Canada, and its economic actions.\nHow to respond is more controversial. After years of unsuccessful talks and handshake deals with Beijing, the United States should change course and begin cutting some of its economic ties with China. Such a separation would stop intellectual property theft, cut off an important source of support to the People\u2019s Liberation Army and hold companies that are involved in Chinese human rights abuses accountable.\nThis will be no easy task. Some industries will have problems finding new suppliers or buyers, and there are entrenched constituencies that support doing business with China. They argue that any pullback could threaten economic growth. But even if American exports to China fell by half, it would be the equivalent of less than one-half of 1 percent of gross domestic product. The cost of reducing Chinese imports is harder to assess, but there are multiple countries that can substitute for China-based production, none of them strategic rivals and trade predators.\nThe United States economy and its national security have been harmed by China\u2019s rampant theft of intellectual property and the requirement that American companies that want to do business in the country hand over their technology. These actions threaten America\u2019s comparative advantage in innovation and its military edge.\nEven uncoerced foreign investment in technology can strengthen the Chinese military-industrial complex, especially since the Communist Party has moved, since President Xi Jinping took office in 2012, to a defense industrial policy that translates in English to \u201ccivil-military fusion.\u201d In practice, many Chinese and foreign \u201ccivilian\u201d companies serve as de facto suppliers for the Chinese Army and its technological-industrial base. Residents and visitors are subject to constant visual surveillance, and a nascent \u201csocial credit program\u201d in which disobedience to party dictates is reflected in credit scores, which could affect everything from home purchases to job opportunities. These forms of social control often use technology developed by Western companies.\nThe United States should make major adjustments to its economic relationship with China. Comprehensive tariffs, which harm American consumers and workers unnecessarily, are not the right reaction. But neither are admonishments to \u201cjust let the market work.\u201d\nThe scale of China\u2019s industrial-policy distortions, technology thievery and efforts to modernize its army are too significant for such superficial responses. The American government must intervene in the market when it comes to China, although that intervention should be limited to areas that are genuinely vital to national security, prosperity and democratic values.\nFor example, the United States government should impose sanctions on the Chinese beneficiaries of intellectual property theft and coercion, in cooperation with our allies. This was the legitimate target of the United States trade representative\u2019s original inquiry in August 2017 under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, but the policy steps chosen \u2014 tariffs \u2014 focus on the trade deficit instead of loss of intellectual property.\nRather than across-the-board tariffs, Chinese companies receiving stolen or coerced intellectual property should not be allowed to do business with firms in America or, with our allies\u2019 cooperation, in Europe and Japan. The United States should also intervene to halt foreign investment in any technology that assists the Chinese Army or contributes to internal repression and limit the access to global markets of any Chinese company that is tied to human rights abuses and army modernization.\nTaking these actions would require an enormous amount of intelligence collection by American security agencies as well as crucial information from American companies. The latter is difficult to obtain: Out of fear of Chinese retribution, the foreign business community will cooperate only if there is a clear, bipartisan and long-term commitment by the American government.\nWhile the United States must act unilaterally if necessary, the cooperation of allies such as Japan, Germany and Britain would make these steps more effective. Such countries have their own interests in China. Imposing sanctions in the name of national security on the European Union and China, as the Trump administration has threatened, would unwisely give them common cause.\nPrevious efforts to assert America\u2019s influence against China, such as the discarded Trans-Pacific Partnership, did not push back effectively on Chinese economic aggression. Working with allies to directly address China\u2019s malfeasance would.\nAll this means putting China at the top of American international economic priorities and keeping it there for years, without overstating or overreacting to trade disputes with our allies.\nThe administration has demonstrated some good instincts on China, but it must not be distracted by the next round of Beijing\u2019s false economic promises. Protecting innovation from Chinese attack makes the United States stronger. Hindering the Chinese security apparatus makes external aggression and internal repression more costly for Beijing.\nChina is our only major trade partner that is also a strategic rival, and we should treat it differently from friendly countries with whom we have disputes. If Washington wants the global free market to work, it must intervene to blunt Beijing\u2019s belligerence.\nDerek Scissors (@DerekScissors1) is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, where Daniel Blumenthal (@DAlexBlumenthal) is the director of Asian studies.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The Answer May Soon Come Out\n[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\nThe first time Vienna Rye noticed her cellphone acting up was at a 2014 protest march against the police killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown. The device shut down abruptly as she was filming, even though the battery was fully charged.\nShe and other activists who had similar experiences at subsequent Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 cellphones suddenly switching off or losing reception, messaging apps going haywire \u2014 began to suspect the police were monitoring their telephones with Stingrays, devices that mimic cell towers and intercept communications.\nMs. Vienna and two other activists filed a public records request for information about police surveillance of the Millions March, a local group affiliated with the Movement for Black Lives. The Police Department rejected the request with a blanket statement that it \u201ccould neither confirm nor deny\u201d whether the records existed, relying on what is known as the \u201cGlomar response,\u201d which is usually invoked only by defense or intelligence agencies in cases of national security. The activists sued the department with the help of the New York Civil Liberties Union.\nOn Monday, a state judge ruled the police had to acknowledge whether or not they had used devices to monitor or interfere with the protesters\u2019 cellphones, rejecting the Police Department\u2019s argument that releasing the information would compromise its counterterrorism and criminal investigations.\nJustice Arlene Bluth of State Supreme Court said that if the police are using the cell-site simulator technology on protesters then it is violating the law and \u201ccannot hide exposure of that fact through a Glomar response.\u201d\nThe Glomar response, she wrote, \u201ccontradicts the purpose of disclosure\u201d under the state Freedom of Information Law.\nThe department had successfully used the same legal tactic in 2017 to block two open-records requests for documents about its secret surveillance of people in Muslim neighborhoods. The state\u2019s highest court sided with the Police Department in that case, but said the Glomar response can be used only in a narrow category of cases involving counterterrorism investigations.\nThree years ago, the police acknowledged after a separate open-records lawsuit that it had used Stingray technology more than a thousand times between 2008 and 2015 to locate suspects in a wide range of crimes, from murder to calling 911 too many times.\nFor the past four decades, the Police Department\u2019s ability to spy on political organizations and protesters has been curtailed under a court settlement known as the Handschu Agreement, which is overseen by a federal judge. That settlement put limits on the investigation of political organizations, creating an oversight panel and requiring that the police have \u201cspecific information\u201d that a crime was in the works before investigating.\nBut the department has violated the Handschu guidelines at times while investigating left-wing political activists.\nIn court filings, the Police Department argued that disclosure of the department\u2019s methods of monitoring cellphones would compromise counterterrorism operations and place New Yorkers at risk. In a sworn affidavit, John J. Miller, the city\u2019s deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said that releasing information about cellphone surveillance technology would help terrorists carry out an attack and \u201csuccessfully evade detection.\u201d\nThe department released a written statement on Monday stating that it would review the decision. It has 30 days to appeal.\n\u201cThe N.Y.P.D. uses the Glomar response exceedingly sparingly and only after careful consideration of the interests involved, including transparency, the need to protect the integrity of criminal investigations and public safety,\u201d the statement read.\nBobby Hodgson, a staff attorney at the civil liberties union who argued the case, said in an interview that Justice Bluth\u2019s ruling was a firm rejection of the Police Department\u2019s legal tactic.\n\u201cThis is the N.Y.P.D.\u2019s attempt to massively expand the scope of Glomar and the cases to which it applies,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to deny public access to basic information about how the department monitors protesters.\u201d\nThe department\u2019s sophisticated arsenal of surveillance technology extends beyond cellphone surveillance devices to license plate readers, facial recognition software and drones. Officials have kept the department\u2019s capabilities largely shrouded in secrecy, civil liberties advocates said.\nSome city lawmakers have begun to push back. This year, Councilwoman Vanessa Gibson, a Bronx Democrat, said she plans to reintroduce a bill that would force the police to disclose their surveillance tools. A similar bill failed in 2017 after the Police Department and Mayor Bill de Blasio came out strongly against it.\nChristopher Dunn, the associate director of the civil liberties union, said the department\u2019s handling of the Black Lives Matter request demonstrated the need for outside oversight.\n\u201cThis ruling shows that the N.Y.P.D. cannot be trusted when it comes to disclosing technology that it\u2019s going to use against the public,\u201d Mr. Dunn said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why there has to be legislative reform.\u201d\nFollow Ali Winston on Twitter: @awinston", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

So why did she?\nThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nSheikh Hasina has done marvels for Bangladesh over nearly 10 consecutive years as prime minister. Per-capita income in what was one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world has grown by nearly 150 percent, and the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty has dropped from 19 percent to about 9 percent. All the greater the pity that her achievements have been offset by a precipitous slide toward authoritarianism and an election in which Mrs. Hasina\u2019s party won 288 of the 300 contested seats in Parliament, a preposterous 96 percent rate of victory.\nIn the weeks and months before the Dec. 30 vote, local and international human rights organizations chronicled a relentless campaign of intimidation, ranging from violence and arrests of opposition candidates and protesters to surveillance and a draconian digital security law that includes prison terms for posting \u201caggressive or frightening\u201d content. At least 17 people died in campaign violence. A Human Rights Watch report described \u201ca climate of fear extending from prominent voices in society to ordinary citizens,\u201d without any interference by an intimidated judiciary or election commission.\nIn an interview with The Times in December, the prime minister appeared to share the delusion of autocrats everywhere that human rights concerns were peripheral to a developing country\u2019s economic growth. \u201cIf I can provide food, jobs and health care, that is human rights,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat the opposition is saying, or civil society or your NGO\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t bother with that. I know my country, and I know how to develop my country.\u201d\nNo one would question that Mrs. Hasina, who is 71, knows her country. Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was the first president of Bangladesh. She was abroad when he was assassinated in 1975, and she returned in 1981 to take over the leadership of the Awami League, which she has held ever since. Her party and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, led by another powerful woman, Khaleda Zia, took turns in power until the last election, in 2014, which the opposition party boycotted to protest changes to electoral procedures, giving Mrs. Hasina an uncontested new term. Mrs. Zia was jailed for corruption last year, and Mrs. Hasina is back for another term at the head of what has effectively become a one-party state, ready to further tighten control.\nBut why? Why produce nonsensical election results when polls indicated that Mrs. Hasina would likely have won a fair election handily? Mrs. Hasina\u2019s every achievement will now be tainted by her authoritarian methods and repressive measures; her critics, driven into exile or underground, will become only more strident, and her foreign supporters more wary.\nThe State Department, noting that the United States is Bangladesh\u2019s largest foreign investor and largest single-country market, expressed concern about \u201ccredible reports of harassment, intimidation and violence\u201d during the campaign and urged the election commission to work with all sides to address them. The European Union similarly called on Bangladesh to investigate the violence and \u201csignificant obstacles\u201d that had \u201ctainted\u201d the campaign and the vote.\nGiven Mrs. Hasina\u2019s political and personal trajectory, she is unlikely to be moved by such admonitions. But it is incumbent on countries doing business with Bangladesh and cheering its rise from poverty to remind her and her allies at every turn that human rights are not an imposition of an alien culture, but a critical element of development and progress.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Litt, principal associate deputy attorney general, told a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Clinton administration instead is pursuing an \"intensive dialogue\" between industry and law enforcement to try and find a cooperative solution to the debate that has pitted the FBI and the National Security Agency against the high-tech industry and a long list of special interest groups concerned about free speech and privacy issues.\n\"We are all looking at this point not to impose mandatory legislation and will work cooperatively with industry to find whatever solutions are available,\" Litt said.\nAsked by Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, if he was representing the FBI position as well, Litt said, \"Yes, sir.\"\nIt was the first definitive indication that the White House has reined in, at least temporarily, a strong lobbying effort by the FBI's director, Louis B. Freeh, for legislation to establish a system requiring that the \"spare keys\" to all scrambled communications be filed with a third party so law enforcement, with the proper court authorization, can gain immediate access to encrypted data. Separately, the White House had backed a voluntary key recovery plan.\nBut Litt did emphasize repeatedly in his testimony that the shift represents the administration's and FBI's position \"at this time.\" That would likely change quickly if pro-encryption forces move forward with legislation in the House to ban any type of key recovery mandate.\nSenator John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on the Constitution, said \"consistency has not been the hallmark of the administration in terms of this and that's fine.\"\nThe Encryption Debate:\nIs It About Privacy or Security?\n\"But while we're in this negotiating posture I would hope that they would maintain an openness to a variety of approaches because I'm certainly not going to agree to any approach until I can be assured both the free speech and privacy issues are protected.\"\nBarry Smith, an FBI supervisory agent who played a role in getting a mandatory key recovery bill passed by the House Intelligence Committee last year, said \"the objective of law enforcement is to have technical solutions to our concerns.\"\n\"If we can sit down with industry and reach a technical solution to law enforcement's public safety issues on a voluntary basis, we are happy to do that,\" he said.\nFreeh has insisted that without the technical ability to quickly recover encrypted communications, law enforcers in the digital age will be unable to catch or prosecute terrorists, drug dealers and child predators who are increasingly using uncrackable codes to hide their crimes.\nBut opponents of key recovery argue that requiring Americans to file spare keys to their encrypted messages is an unconstitutional violation of privacy and free speech rights. They compare it to having to keep a spare key to your house on file at the local police station, or to government installing surveillance cameras in homes with the promise that they won't turn them on unless it is necessary to investigate a crime.\n\"If you ever want to talk about the proverbial fishing expedition, this is it,\" said Richard Epstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and one of five witnesses from a new coalition fighting encryption controls, Americans for Computer Privacy.\nThe alliance announced two weeks ago that it will launch a multimillion dollar campaign to educate the public about the need for unregulated strong encryption. The same day it launched its campaign, Vice President Al Gore wrote to Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, to say the administration wanted to pursue a cooperative dialogue with industry rather than legislation.\nRelated Articles\nGore Letter Seems to Soften Stance on Encryption\n(March 5, 1998)\nEncryption Issue Threatens Silicon Valley Rapport With Clinton White House\n(February 27, 1998)\nLitt reiterated that call at the hearing.\n\"The Administration is not wedded to key recovery, or any single technological approach,\" he said. \"We are flexible, provided that the resulting solutions and arrangements preserve the nation's ability to protect the public safety and defend our national security.\"\nWayne Madsen with the Electronic Privacy Information Center said he was skeptical that the talk of a cooperative dialogue represented any real shift by the administration in the encryption debate.\n\"My feeling is it's still the same old policy wrapped up in different wrapping paper,\" Madsen said.\nRelated Sites\nFollowing are links to the external Web sites mentioned in this article.

It requires mandatory 15-year sentences for people convicted of possessing firearms if they have earlier been found guilty of three violent felonies or serious drug charges.\nFiguring out what qualifies as one of those earlier offenses is not always easy. Tuesday\u2019s decision considered a part of the law that defined violent felonies to include offenses involving the use or threat of physical force. The question in the case was whether minimal force, as in a purse snatching, is enough.\nIn analyzing whether given crimes qualify as violent felonies under the federal law, the Supreme Court does not look to what the defendant actually did. Rather, it considers whether the crime \u2014 in this case, robbery under Florida law \u2014 covers conduct that does not qualify as a violent felony.\nThe case involved Denard Stokeling, who pleaded guilty to possessing a gun after burglarizing the Tongue & Cheek restaurant in Miami Beach, where he worked. After he was identified based on surveillance video and witness statements, police found a gun in his backpack. He was prosecuted on federal gun charges.\nMr. Stokeling had three earlier convictions, and prosecutors invoked the sentencing law to argue he should serve a much longer prison term than the one the gun charge would ordinarily have warranted.\nMr. Stokeling objected, saying that one of his convictions, for robbery in Florida state court arising from a snatched necklace, did not amount to a violent felony. That meant, he said, that he should face only a maximum sentence of 10 years rather than a minimum sentence of 15 years.\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, said Mr. Stokeling\u2019s robbery conviction counted as a violent felony for purposes of the federal law. The Florida law required proof the victim resisted, he wrote, and that was enough.\n\u201cThe force necessary to overcome a victim\u2019s physical resistance is inherently \u2018violent,\u2019\u201d Justice Thomas wrote.\n\u201cThis is true because robbery that must overpower a victim\u2019s will \u2014 even a feeble or weak-willed victim \u2014 necessarily involves a physical confrontation and struggle,\u201d Justice Thomas wrote. \u201cThe altercation need not cause pain or injury or even be prolonged; it is the physical contest between the criminal and the victim that is itself \u2018capable of causing physical pain or injury.\u2019 \u201d\nThe quoted phrase came from a 2010 decision, Johnson v. United States, that concluded that convictions under Florida\u2019s battery statute did not qualify as violent felonies for purposes of the federal sentencing law.\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer, who generally votes with the court\u2019s liberal wing in closely divided cases, joined the majority opinion on Tuesday, as did Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying the majority opinion could not be reconciled with the 2010 decision or the reality of how little force is required to be convicted of robbery under the Florida law.\n\u201cA pickpocket who attempts to pull free after the victim catches his arm\u201d qualifies, she wrote. \u201cA thief who grabs a bag from a victim\u2019s shoulder also commits Florida robbery, so long as the victim instinctively holds on to the bag\u2019s strap for a moment.\u201d\nJustice Sotomayor added that locking up such offenders for long periods does not advance public safety. \u201cUnder Florida law, \u2018robbers\u2019 can be glorified pickpockets, shoplifters and purse snatchers,\u201d she wrote.\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the dissent in the case, Stokeling v. United States, No. 17-5554, as did Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.\nHad the court ruled for Mr. Stokeling, Justice Thomas wrote, convictions under at least 31 state robbery laws would have become ineligible to serve as qualifying offenses under the federal sentencing law.\nJustice Sotomayor questioned the accuracy of that statement and said earlier decisions from the court had already substantially narrowed the scope of the sentencing law. \u201cThe majority, fearful for the camel, errs in blaming the most recent straw,\u201d she wrote.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\nIn New York, prosecutors operate within a draconian system that gives them free rein to leave defendants in the dark about aspects of their cases for months or even years.\nIn cases big and small, state law authorizes prosecutors to withhold key evidence from defense lawyers and their clients until the eve or sometimes the day of trial. Prosecutors in New York do not have a legal obligation to turn over in a timely fashion all police reports, witness names, DNA evidence, surveillance footage or anything else from their investigative files.\nThough a 1963 Supreme Court decision found that prosecutors have a constitutional duty to turn over anything significant that may exonerate a defendant, that ruling has not been consistently enforced because prosecutors who flout the rule are rarely punished.\nAdvocates for defendants say this entrenched legal structure in New York puts a \u201cblindfold\u201d over the eyes of defense lawyers and their clients. And it runs up against Americans\u2019 basic understanding of how fairness is meant to work in the legal system.\nBy preventing access to even the simplest information about a pending case, prosecutors thumb their noses at the presumption of innocence that is owed to every person accused of a crime. They also run the risk of forcing the accused to make an impossible choice: Plead guilty with little to no information about their case or go to trial and risk an even harsher punishment.\nNew York\u2019s law means that cases take longer to resolve, leading to backlogs; that defense lawyers are unable to advise their clients about the charges against them, let alone guide them through an often life-altering process; and that wrongful convictions can occur, in both extreme and not-so-extreme cases.\nMost states, including the law-and-order bastion Texas as well as North Carolina and New Jersey, have changed their laws and procedures to allow open and early disclosure of evidence in criminal prosecutions, which has led to fairer outcomes and deterred prosecutorial abuse.\nNow New York has a chance to join the mainstream on this issue.\nBy repealing the outmoded statute that allows for 11th-hour evidence disclosure and passing legislation that would make access to this information automatic at or near the beginning of a criminal case, New York lawmakers could level the playing field for defendants and bring the state closer to its progressive ideals.\nProsecutors defend New York\u2019s current system not on its merits but with fearmongering, arguing that reforms will leave witnesses and victims at risk. Disclosing the identity of a person with direct knowledge of an incident under investigation, the thinking goes, would hamper the state\u2019s ability to protect him or her and to fight crime.\nBut there are sensible ways of dealing with witness safety concerns. The Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office, which has for decades made its evidence files readily available, shows that reform is possible. Likewise, the states that have left the old model behind have seen no need to go back to it.\nIt\u2019s time for New York lawmakers to bring the rest of the state in line with this essential notion of justice.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful.\u201d\nThere are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 16, 2019\nThis is misleading.\nWhile governments around the world have built or planned to build 77 walls, about seven such barriers are not expected to materialize anytime soon, said Elisabeth Vallet, a researcher at the University of Quebec in Montreal who keeps a tally of such construction.\nSeventy walls is closer to the truth, she said.\nEurope has built about 1,000 kilometers, or just over 620 miles, of walls since 2015, Ms. Vallet said.\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the source of the numbers the president cited in his tweet. Some observers on social media speculated that he had been watching a report on Fox Business that examined the issue the night before.\nDefining \u2018wall\u2019\nWhat Mr. Trump may think of as a \u201cbig, beautiful wall,\u201d whether made of concrete or steel slats, would not fit the definition in Europe. Most of the walls he referred to on the Continent are, in fact, different styles of fences with masonry foundations.\nAnd not all of them were designed with migration in mind.\nCountries like Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Slovenia have built walls since 2015 to quell the flow of migrants arriving mainly from the Middle East via the Balkan Route.\nBut Ukraine and the Baltic States that share borders with Russia have started raising barriers to mark their territories in response to perceived threats of invasion from their larger neighbor.\n\u201cAlmost a third of the walls in the world are designed to keep the neighbor out,\u201d Ms. Vallet said.\n\u2018Fortress Europe\u2019\nMuch like the desert terrain along the United States border with Mexico, the perilous seas, not walls, have been the main obstacle for people trying to get to Europe.\nThe Continent has gone beyond building walls to impede the arrival of undocumented migrants. Frontex, the European Union\u2019s border agency, and national governments raised a security apparatus that is often referred to as Fortress Europe.\nIt includes naval patrols and surveillance on the Mediterranean, where most migrants try to cross into Europe. European governments work with countries like Libya, Morocco and Turkey to try to deter migrants from attempting deadly sea crossings.\nLast year, an estimated 150,000 illegal crossings were detected on the external borders of the European Union, according to Frontex. (The same person may attempt the crossing and be counted in different locations.) This was 25 percent less than in 2017, and the lowest level in five years.\nStill, far-right politicians like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary have promoted the specter of an impending migration crisis, accompanied by xenophobic rhetoric, to justify funds for border protection.\n[Read more about whether Europe is still facing a migration crisis.]\nSuccess is relative\n\u201cThe boosting and militarization of border security has led to a higher death toll for forcibly displaced persons,\u201d according to a report released in May by the Transnational Institute, a research and advocacy institute.\nIn another report on border walls, researchers at the institute looked at maritime barriers in the Mediterranean and considered them as significant or more significant than land barriers on the European continent.\nWalls have worked for politicians who used them as a means to mobilize supporters, but not to deal with the problem of migration, Nick Buxton, a researcher with the institute, said by phone.\n\u201cYou can build more and more walls until you\u2019re a completely walled society, but all you\u2019re doing is making it more and more dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will find ways to cross walls.\u201d\nThe fence around the entrance of the tunnel providing the only land access to Britain from Continental Europe has failed to deter illegal crossings. Last year, about 500 migrants, 10 times as many as in 2017, attempted to cross the perilous waters of the English Channel from France. More than half completed the journey.\nReports of smugglers operating around most of these points of access suggest to researchers that walls alone cannot solve the problem.\n\u201cEvery time you have a border fence and no public policy that is dealing with the root problem, it is as if you were inviting organized crime to the table,\u201d Ms. Vallet said.\nMs. Vallet said she could not think of historical examples of walls that work.\nShe noted that both the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line in France \u2014 each built at great expense \u2014 ultimately failed to stop invaders.\nPalko Karasz is a digital editor, based in London.

It is about defending the world order.\nMs. von der Leyen is the German defense minister.\nBERLIN \u2014 In April, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will celebrate its 70th birthday. Founded in the earliest years of the Cold War, it is just as relevant today, when many feel that the international order is shaken again. In fact, if NATO did not exist, those in favor of a free world would have to invent it.\nWhile NATO\u2019s key purpose remains to guarantee the security of its members, it has never been a purely military alliance. It is a political alliance as well, based on the common aspirations of its members who, as the NATO Treaty says, \u201care determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of its peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.\u201d\nThese principles are under assault today. Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, the terrorism of the Islamic State spreading from the Middle East to the capitals of Europe, authoritarian regimes developing nuclear weapons \u2014 as different as these challenges are, they have one thread in common: They emanate from actors who oppose the international order. They try to undermine or even change the rules that have governed the age of democracy and prosperity since World War II.\nThe democracies of NATO need to stand together to overcome these challenges. Collectively, we are stronger than even the mightiest of us would be on her own. Accordingly, since 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine, NATO has adapted to the situation at hand \u2014 as it has done many times in its history. Among 29 sovereign states with different political cultures and points of view, such adaptations will always be complicated, and sometimes even messy. But NATO\u2019s ability to change its priorities and its strategies ensures that the alliance will stand the test of time.\nThe results are tangible. For one thing, all European members of NATO have increased their military spending. The German defense budget, for example, today has increased by 36 percent compared to when I took office in late 2013. We still have more to do to fairly share the burden within the alliance, and we are prepared to do more. But we also keep in mind that burden-sharing is not only about cash, but also about capabilities and contributions. Germany is thus, as the second-largest troop contributor to NATO, proud to lead NATO\u2019s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force.\nNATO has also increased its presence in Eastern Europe, plays an active role in training Iraqi security forces and contributing surveillance to the fight against the Islamic State, continues to support the Afghan government, and develops its partnerships with like-minded nations such as Australia and Japan, in addition to much more.\nIn fulfilling its three core tasks \u2014 collective defense, crisis management and partnerships \u2014 NATO is an irreplaceable building block for an international order that favors freedom and peace.\nMost of all, NATO is not a trans-Atlantic organization in name only. It represents a special, even emotional bond between the American and the European continents. For a German, images of the fall of the Berlin Wall are inextricably linked with the alliance, and my country is particularly grateful for the security and the opportunities NATO has been providing for decades. So yes, in addition to the practical benefits of bases, structures and troops, NATO has a value in and of itself.\nMaybe the most basic benefit of NATO is that it provides reliability in an unreliable world. Our unshakable commitment to Article 5, the NATO treaty\u2019s collective defense provision, ensures that our common security is truly indivisible. We will help our weakest ally just as we have helped our strongest by invoking Article 5 \u2014 for the first and only time in NATO\u2019s history \u2014 after Sept. 11, 2001.\nSo it is a good thing that the European Union is now undertaking significant steps to enhance its military prowess. If members of the European Union succeed in harmonizing their defense planning and military procurement, and in intertwining their armed forces, then all of this will add to NATO\u2019s strength.\nAnd a stronger NATO will serve the security interests of all members. Most of all, it will send a clear signal to those opposing the rules-based international order: We trans-Atlantic allies are ready and willing to defend our soil, our people and our freedom.\nUrsula von der Leyen is the federal minister of defense of Germany.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It is the point farthest from a sea or ocean on the planet. Located in China just east of the border with Kazakhstan, the pole gets you a good distance from harbors and coastlines \u2014 at least 1,550 miles in any direction \u2014 into an expanse of white steppe and blue-beige mountain that is among the least populated places on earth. Here, among some of the last surviving pastoral nomads in Central Asia, nestled between two branches of the Tian Shan range on the edge of Kazakhstan, the largest infrastructure project in the history of the world is growing.\nAbout 80 miles from the Pole of Inaccessibility, just across the border in Kazakhstan, is a village called Khorgos. It has spent most of its existence on the obscure periphery of international affairs, and its official population is just 908. But over the last few years, it has become an important node of the global economy. It is part of an initiative known informally as the new Silk Road, a China-led effort to build a vast cephalopodic network of highways, railroads and overseas shipping routes, supported by hundreds of new plants, pipelines and company towns in dozens of countries. Ultimately, the Belt and Road Initiative, or B.R.I., as the project is more formally known, will link China\u2019s coastal factories and rising consumer class with Central, Southeast and South Asia; with the Gulf States and the Middle East; with Africa; and with Russia and all of Europe, all by way of a lattice of land and sea routes whose collective ambition boggles the mind.\nKhorgos is a flagship project of this work in progress, an international shipping hub and free-trade zone that its promoters say is poised to become the next Dubai. Thanks to its location at the junction of the world\u2019s soon-to-be-largest national economy and its largest landlocked country, Khorgos has become an unlikely harbinger of the interconnected planet: a zone fully enclosed by the logic of globalization, where goods flow freely across sovereign borders, following corridors designed to locate every human being on the planet within a totalizing network of producers and consumers, buyers and sellers.\n[Read about China\u2019s $1 trillion plan to shake up the economic order.]\nSuch victories of the global and industrial over the local, isolated and rural are heralded as the inevitable future \u2014 if there is to be a future \u2014 of our species. What would that future look like? Whom would it benefit? What would it cost? To find out, last July I caught a sleeper train from Almaty, Kazakhstan\u2019s largest city, to the Chinese border, where I woke up in a train yard surrounded by desert.\nKhorgos is one of a cluster of villages encircling a former trading post of the ancient world called Zharkent. From Zharkent, I hoped to arrange a ride to the border. Frescoes of camel caravans flanked the entrance gate on Silk Road Avenue. In a central square stood a rainbow-colored mosque with the sweeping eaves of a Chinese pagoda and an inscription in Uighur enjoining visitors not to forget their past. Next to the mosque was the warren of chopped-up shipping containers that serves as Zharkent\u2019s central market. Taxi drivers hung unhopefully around the watermelon stands.\nAmong the drivers was a farmer named Nunur, who had come to Kazakhstan from China in 1962, when he was a young boy and Kazakhstan was a Soviet Socialist Republic. That year, more than 60,000 Chinese Uighurs and Kazakhs escaped to the Soviet Union, crossing with Soviet passports they received from the consulate in Xinjiang and with the apparent cooperation of Chinese border guards. Nunur remembered his parents walking him over red hills at night toward the checkpoint at Khorgos. \u201cThey opened the border and let us go into Soviet territory,\u201d he recalled. There were rumors that his relatives who stayed behind were imprisoned or killed. (Nunur, fearing trouble from the authorities, asked that I use only his first name.) His parents, who had raised wheat in China, found work on a collective farm. His mother became a cook while his father learned to drive tractors and Nunur to repair them. He became an expert mechanic. \u201cI\u2019m a master without a diploma,\u201d he said.\nI asked Nunur to drive me to a place near the border where we could take in the booming hub of Khorgos at a glance. On the way, we passed his cornfields, apportioned to him after the breakup of the collective farm. Even as Kazakhstan modernized following its 1991 independence, growing rich by regional standards from the sale of oil and outfitting a new capital city with glossy architectural marvels, the eastern border with China remained sparsely developed, its economy dominated by livestock and grain production. Nunur said his village still had no indoor plumbing, and as we left his fields we passed some of the ruins of centralized planning the Soviets left behind: a former winery, a shuttered milk plant.\nChina\u2019s plans are significantly more ambitious, and they reach far beyond eastern Kazakhstan. The \u201cbelt\u201d of the B.R.I. refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt, a tangle of rail and highway routes currently vining their way untidily across the continent from eastern China to Scandinavia. The \u201croad\u201d is the Maritime Silk Road, a shipping lane that will connect Quanzhou to Venice, with prospective stops along the way in Malaysia, Ethiopia and Egypt. To date, at least 68 countries, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the planet\u2019s total population, have signed on to bilateral projects partly funded by China\u2019s policy banks and other state-owned enterprises. Chinese firms are building or investing in new highways and coal-fired power plants in Pakistan, ports in Greece and Sri Lanka, gas and oil pipelines in Central Asia, an industrial city in Oman and a $6 billion railway project in Laos, which in 2017 had a G.D.P. of less than $17 billion. China\u2019s port holdings stretch from Myanmar to Israel and from Mauritius to Belgium. It has spent an estimated $200 billion on B.R.I. projects so far, mostly in Asia, and has implied it will spend a total of $1 trillion on hundreds of projects around the world in the coming years, dwarfing the Marshall Plan by roughly an order of magnitude. When the investments from all the participating countries are combined, the estimated cost rises to $8 trillion.\nThe B.R.I. is so big and multifarious that describing it can feel like trying to narrate the weather conditions of the entire planet. Some individual components span hundreds of miles and are themselves dauntingly complex and international, like the $68 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or the stalled and scandal-mired Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Corridor. Taken as a whole, the B.R.I. is unfathomable. But I had heard that, at Khorgos, a pioneering outpost, I could get closer than anywhere else to appreciating the scope of its aspirations.\nNunur drove me through his village to an overlook within view of a border sentry post, a few miles from the spot where he crossed into Kazakhstan almost six decades before. We parked near a small rock-crushing plant above a valley of bright green cornfields. Beyond the fields, through a blue haze, I could see this improbable new crossroads of the global economy.\nThe Chinese side of the border was easiest to spot. Since 2014, an instant city of 100,000 people, also called Khorgos (sometimes spelled Horgos), has appeared; its dark high-rises glittered in the sun. The Kazakh side of the border was less impressive from afar, but I knew it now hosted a first-of-its-kind free-trade zone, opened on territory shared with China. Behind a copse of cypress trees, I could also make out the gantry cranes of the new dry port \u2014 an inland shipping-and-logistics hub for freight trains \u2014 that began operating in 2015 and could soon be the largest port of its kind in the world. Adjacent to the dry port was a nascent railroad company town, and other plots nearby were cleared for factories and warehouses to be staffed by some of the future residents of the city of 100,000 that, if all goes as planned, will soon rise to match the one across the border.\n[ The Times\u2019s special report on how China became a superpower.]\nThe manager of the plant wandered over. He asked whether we wanted to get through the checkpoint, beyond which was the last village in Kazakhstan and, beyond that, China.\nWe got back in the car and pulled up to two guards who stood at the gate, rifles slung over their shoulders. They looked young and bored. The manager shouted the name of one of them, who walked shyly up to the passenger-side window. It seemed as if everyone in town knew everyone else.\n\u201cGive me some sunflower seeds,\u201d the manager said. The guard pulled a bag from his pocket and poured seeds into the manager\u2019s cupped hand until it overflowed. The manager explained that we wanted to see China. The guard shrugged and raised the boom gate.\nTwo miles beyond the checkpoint, across a valley of farmland, a tangerine ridge signaled the start of China\u2019s largest territory, Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. The border was somewhere in the valley beneath us. If we kept going, we would arrive at the Chinese sentry post we could just make out at the top of a train of switchbacks. We didn\u2019t test it, however. In recent years, the Chinese government has erected the most advanced police state in the world in Xinjiang, targeting the region\u2019s Turkic Muslims, especially its Uighur ethnic group, who make up about half the region\u2019s population. As part of what Chinese Communist Party literature describes as \u201cde-extremification\u201d efforts to combat terrorism, authorities have created an exclusion zone of state surveillance, arbitrary mass internment, brainwashing and torture that covers an area more than four times the size of Germany and includes a population almost as big as Australia\u2019s. According to the United States State Department, between 800,000 and two million people, or up to 15 percent of Xinjiang\u2019s Muslim population, have been incarcerated in a growing network of more than 1,000 concentration camps.\nYou couldn\u2019t see any of that from our perch at the border. Everything looked peaceful. To our left, a shepherd\u2019s path ascended into white-capped mountains where herdsmen grazed sheep and cattle in summer, far above the fields of corn and sunflowers. To our right, beyond the ridge, the high-modernist future of international commerce was springing up out of the ground. You could squint and imagine you were looking at a time-lapse photo of the entire history of collective human activity, from the first wandering goat-herder all the way to the present.\nChina has never released any official map of Belt and Road routes nor any list of approved projects, and it provides no exact count of participating nations or even guidelines on what it means to be a participant. But this fuzziness may be one of its defining advantages. Rather than a list of megaprojects and bilateral deals, some of which might stumble or fail, the B.R.I. can be understood as a vaguely visible hand guiding all the interlocking developments in infrastructure, energy and trade where China plays any kind of role.\nIt is also a framework through which China\u2019s leaders can present virtually any component of its foreign policy, from a soda-ash plant in Turkey to China\u2019s first foreign military base, in Djibouti, as part of a nonthreatening vision of what party representatives like to call \u201cwin win\u201d global development. In recent years, China has floated several expansions of President Xi Jinping\u2019s initial Belt and Road vision that make its scope seem all but limitless: the \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d into the frontiers of the virtual, the \u201cPacific Silk Road\u201d to South America, and the Arctic-crossing \u201cSilk Road on Ice.\u201d Xi himself has meanwhile extolled the merits of globalization at Davos and worked to brand his \u201cproject of the century\u201d as a natural extension of the spontaneous trade routes that once laced across the Eurasian continent.\nCritics have described the B.R.I. as a new kind of colonialism or even part of a strategy of \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy,\u201d seducing cash-poor countries with infrastructure projects that are unlikely to generate enough revenue to cover the interest on the loans that funded them. That is the unhappy situation at the China-funded Port of Hambantota in Sri Lanka, which the China Harbor Engineering Company took over after Sri Lanka fell behind on debt service. The Center for Global Development lists eight countries that face high risk of \u201cdebt distress\u201d from B.R.I. projects that they can\u2019t afford.\n[Read about China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America.]\nKazakhstan is poised to play a literally central role in China\u2019s plan. The B.R.I. was first announced in Astana, at a 2013 ceremony attended by Xi and Kazakhstan\u2019s longtime president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. At the same event, Xi and Nazarbayev also celebrated the opening of a joint gas pipeline and signed $30 billion worth of trade and investment agreements. Although in the past Kazakhstan\u2019s economy has tended to orbit Russia\u2019s, in 2007 China edged out Russia as Kazakhstan\u2019s top importer, and some critics fear that the B.R.I. is leading the country deeper into economic vassalage. \u201cSome people think that China is too big,\u201d Nygmet Ibadildin, an assistant professor of international relations at Kimep University, in Almaty, told me. \u201cKazakh people want a win-win with the B.R.I., but in these situations China wins more often.\u201d\nEven in a country with few meaningful democratic rights, there are risks to courting foreign investment. In 2016, a proposed law that would have permitted parcels of farmland to be leased to Chinese companies sparked nationwide protests, leading Nazarbayev to table the measure.\nThe human rights crisis in Xinjiang has not helped China\u2019s standing in Kazakhstan, either, although the Kazakh government has been careful not to make any public statements that might alienate an important economic partner. While diplomats may be negotiating on behalf of ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang behind closed doors \u2014 in January, the Kazakh foreign ministry announced that China would allow 2,000 ethnic Kazakhs to give up their citizenship and cross the border into Kazakhstan \u2014 the government is not letting the presence of a prison state across the border interfere with its collaboration with China.\nThat may be largely thanks to the immediate economic concerns of both states, not to mention a shared penchant for autocracy, but it may also owe something to the unprecedented nature of the B.R.I. In many participating countries, the project\u2019s very novelty seems to lend itself to gauzy optimism. In September, the Chinese state-run media group People\u2019s Daily commemorated the fifth anniversary of the B.R.I. with a music video modeled after Coca-Cola\u2019s famous 1971 \u201cI\u2019d Like to Buy the World a Coke\u201d TV spot. The new video featured altered lyrics like \u201cI\u2019d like to build the world a road/And furnish it with love,\u201d sung by smiling representatives of dozens of participant nations, decked out in ruquns, hijabs and dashikis. Rather than defining the initiative in any concrete way, the video slyly co-opts Coke\u2019s ability to serve as empty cipher, meaning anything to anyone. Whatever it is, the B.R.I. is \u201cwhat the world needs today/It\u2019s the real thing.\u201d\nKhorgos Gateway rises out of the flat desert basin, a pale yellow moon base of cranes and storage silos into which, every so often, a freight train slowly rolls. A trio of rail-mounted gantry cranes loomed 50 feet overhead as I arrived on a damp, overcast morning. Khorgos Gateway may be the most advanced port in Central Asia, but it retains some of eastern Kazakhstan\u2019s rustic atmosphere. When I walked into the lobby of the dry port\u2019s main offices, a security guard was handing out apples he had picked in his garden.\nThe chief executive of Khorgos Gateway, Zhaslan Khamzin, welcomed me into a tidy office overlooking the freight yard. \u201cThe future lies here,\u201d he said proudly. Khorgos was blessed by its position in the middle of Eurasia. \u201cLook at a map, and you\u2019ll see China on one side, Europe on the other, Russia to the north and the Caucasus and Iran to the east. Why am I pointing this out? Precisely because 90 percent of cargo traffic to these countries is currently made by sea.\u201d\nSince the dry port\u2019s inaugural train passed through in 2015, Khamzin said, companies who manufacture goods in China have begun to recognize the advantages of a modernized overland trade route across Asia. The dry port has transferred John Deere combines to Azerbaijan, he claimed, and Hewlett-Packard parts to Western Europe. He added that it may be much cheaper to ship containers by sea, but it can take more than three times as long, and air transit is the most expensive by far. By contrast, a container passing through Khorgos can travel from a Chinese point of origin to Europe in about 14 days, faster than the sea and cheaper than the air. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a central distribution point,\u201d he concluded. If all goes well, according to company forecasts, in a few years Khorgos Gateway will be the largest dry port in the world.\nOut in the shipping yard, wild dogs sniffed at stacked containers. It started to rain. A train had just pulled into port, and workers in yellow slickers were jogging out to meet it. Friendship between nations notwithstanding, Chinese border authorities are tight-lipped about freight schedules. The port sometimes learns about an impending arrival only an hour before it appears on the horizon, whereupon a swift ballet of machine and human movement begins. A siren blared as a gantry crane began to creep toward me through the mist. The three 41-ton cranes straddled six rail lines \u2014 three are the wide-gauge rails that stretch across the post-Soviet world from Helsinki to Ulaanbaatar; three are the standard gauge used in both China and Europe \u2014 and from my perspective they appeared to tower impossibly over the mountains around us. From a dangling control booth, a crane operator lowered containers onto their beds with dull-eyed expertise.\n[What the world\u2019s emptiest international airport says about China.]\nThe national railway company of Kazakhstan owns 51 percent of Khorgos Gateway. The remaining 49 percent is split between two Chinese state-owned companies. Khamzin viewed China\u2019s participation not as economic imperialism but as proof of the port\u2019s likelihood of success. The Chinese, he explained, \u201care the kind of people that if they saw no commercial opportunity, they wouldn\u2019t invest here.\u201d\nSuch arrangements are less one-sided in Kazakhstan than in some of the more debt-strapped B.R.I. countries, so it\u2019s very unlikely that what happened in Sri Lanka will happen here. But Chinese investments have in all likelihood muffled Kazakhstan\u2019s response to the crackdown in Xinjiang.\nEach train that arrives at Khorgos has to pass through the Chinese region, which is home to 24 million people, including more than 12 million Uighurs and about 1.5 million Kazakhs. Although political unrest has troubled the region for decades, including, in recent years, a spate of knife attacks and bombings by Uighur separatists, authorities in Xinjiang have responded with brutal asymmetry, rounding up hundreds of thousands of Uighurs alongside thousands of ethnic Kazakh and Kyrgyz residents in a sweeping internment drive the scope of which rivals Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Their \u201coffenses\u201d range from open displays of religious belief \u2014 wearing a beard, praying in public, owning a Quran or refusing to smoke or eat pork \u2014 to simply traveling with or even speaking to relatives abroad. For those not yet detained, Xinjiang has become a dystopian zone of extralegal checkpoints, patrols, GPS tracking and random home inspections.\nSome experts say the camps and other security measures are partly in reaction to the increased freight traffic across Xinjiang, much of which now comes through Khorgos Gateway. \u201cThe role of Xinjiang has changed greatly with the B.R.I.,\u201d Adrian Zenz, an academic expert on China\u2019s minority policy, told me. China\u2019s B.R.I. ambitions have transformed Xinjiang from a fringe territory into what party leaders call a \u201ccore region\u201d of development. That\u2019s why awareness of the camps among people in places like Kazakhstan was such an issue, Zenz said. \u201cIt has significant potential to cast a very negative light on the Belt and Road.\u201d\nAfter my tour of the dry port, I headed a mile down the road to Nurkent, a newly built town of low bungalows and apartment blocks. For all its symbolic importance, Khorgos Gateway is still a modest operation; if it were a United States seaport, its 2018 throughput would place it somewhere around the 26th-largest in the country, beneath the ports of Mobile, Ala.; Boston; and Gulfport, Miss. There are just 190 employees, which Khamzin said was close to capacity, and most of them live in Nurkent, alongside railroad workers, police officers, border guards, customs officials and other agents of the new frontier. Except for the cawing of crows nesting within an apartment building\u2019s crumbling gables, the town was silent. During a visit to the region in 2016, Nazarbayev predicted the population would grow and merge with Zharkent to form a large city, but this was hard to visualize. The site of a planned expansion was marked by a roundabout with a tiered silver gateway \u2014 the \u201c2001\u201d obelisk as imagined by Frank Gehry \u2014 through whose arch I could see only an untended field of scrubland.\nAs I stood looking at the archway, a car pulled up. A man in straw hat and sandals hoisted himself out of the passenger side. \u201cI guard this place,\u201d he said. He uncoiled a hose on the ground and began watering the grass around the gate. \u201cThis is the double door to the future of Nurkent, where the city will rise up.\u201d\nKhorgos\u2019s other major landmark is a boomtown of open borders known as the International Center for Boundary Cooperation, or I.C.B.C., which China and Kazakhstan established in 2011 about six miles from the dry port. Here it is not only the goods that move freely back and forth but also the people. In this duty- and visa-free zone, Kazakh citizens willing to brave the hourlong wait at customs control are permitted to enter a walled section of the Chinese side of Khorgos across the border to buy cheap linens and electronics, and Chinese tourists may enter a walled leisure area inside Kazakhstan to buy souvenirs and eat Kazakh delicacies like shashlik and laghman.\nA United Nations human rights panel describes the entirety of Xinjiang as a \u201cmassive internment camp,\u201d but that didn\u2019t stop workers I met at the dry port from suggesting I cross into China by way of the I.C.B.C. Khorgos Gateway and the I.C.B.C. are the products of special economic development zones set up in coordination with China: industrial and commercial arenas designed to foster jobs and investments. There are dozens of such zones within China \u2014 the first, Shenzhen, is now a megacity of more than 12 million people \u2014 but Khorgos is the first to exist partly outside China\u2019s own borders. That will soon change. Chinese officials have announced plans to build 50 more international zones in countries from Algeria to Vietnam.\nAt Khorgos, the I.C.B.C. seems intended to complement the dry port\u2019s vision of frictionless trade with an equivalent vision of borderless commerce, even if most Kazakhs understand the project as a wholesale depot for cheaply made Chinese goods. A popular hustle among shopkeepers from Almaty is to hire one of the locals who wait outside the I.C.B.C., and who are euphemistically called \u201ccarriers,\u201d to help circumvent the weight limits on imports. By all accounts, customs officials tend to look the other way.\nMy state-assigned guide picked me up at my hotel in Zharkent in a sleek Mercedes sedan that he drove as if we had just robbed a bank. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d he asked, laughing, as we careered around a watermelon truck. His name was Marat Abaiuly. If the I.C.B.C. was the most important of China\u2019s outposts in Kazakhstan, Abaiuly was its ambassador, the handsome liaison to opinion makers and potential investors. He made his power known by blowing through checkpoints with a friendly honk or, if necessary, by leaping out of the car to grip the soldier on duty by the forearm.\nIt was 10 in the morning, and a line of wholesalers and hopeful carriers had formed beyond a fence topped with concertina wire. Bus drivers reclined inside their open cargo holds, chain-smoking and preparing to nap through the day. Inside the customs-control building, a construction worker was destroying the tile floor with a jackhammer. Improvised lines formed around the rubble.\nChina is said to be spending billions of dollars building up its side of Khorgos. By contrast, Kazakhstan\u2019s share of the I.C.B.C. is mostly a dream of the future. Projects like a constellation of luxury hotels, a sports complex and a Disneyland-style theme park called Happy Land Khorgos have languished for lack of funding. Fields of rubble and stalled construction projects are scattered among the few small retail buildings and the yurt-shaped gift shops that are the Kazakh side\u2019s most distinctive feature.\nIn recent years, the name Khorgos has instead become synonymous among Kazakhs with smuggling rings and high-profile corruption cases. In 2011, authorities arrested the head of customs at Khorgos as part of a larger takedown of a $130 billion smuggling ring. In 2016, the former head of the I.C.B.C. was caught on tape accepting a $1 million bribe for a construction bid. Locals do not tend to figure in these public scandals, but based on the crowds I saw in front of the border checkpoint, informal gray-market carrying at Khorgos seems to have replaced animal husbandry as the region\u2019s main line of work. \u201cMost locals work at the I.C.B.C. carrying cargo,\u201d the chief executive of an Almaty-based truck transport company later told me, describing the work as a kind of pseudolegal smuggling. \u201cThat\u2019s how they make money.\u201d\nAbaiuly arranged for an I.C.B.C. van to drive us across the open border into China, where the main attractions for visiting Kazakhs are four large, windowless malls. The malls are honeycombed with shops where women of all ages and a few older men sell underwear, electronics and an array of other inexpensive products under fluorescent lights. One mall was dedicated entirely to fur coats, a gift of ritual significance in Kazakhstan, particularly between in-laws at weddings. It was early, and there were no customers anywhere. Floor after floor of identical shops stood empty, their racks of odorless pelts doubled and tripled by wall-length mirrors.\nSome workers I met were Chinese citizens from Xinjiang. I had heard that, in some towns, even talking to a journalist is considered grounds for detention, so I didn\u2019t say much, and I was relieved to come across an outspoken furrier from Kazakhstan, Zhannur Erkenkyzy, who had worked at the border for six months. She got the job because she could speak Chinese, Russian, Uighur and Kazakh. She was also the store\u2019s model, she said, and she showed me her Instagram page, on which she appeared nestled inside the furs of minks, foxes and beavers, although at the moment she was wearing no fur at all, just a black cocktail dress that reflected no light.\nErkenkyzy said she worked seven days a week unless she happened to ask for a day off. The time involved in crossing the unpredictable border meant that the job occupied most of her waking life, of which one highlight was catching thieves. \u201cWhen we see a shoplifter, we put on red armbands and beat them with sticks,\u201d she said excitedly. Abaiuly interrupted, whispering in low, snappy Russian: \u201cWhy are you saying such nasty stuff about us to the reporter?\u201d\nBack on the Kazakh side, we wandered the yurts, which were staffed by Chinese clerks who spoke no Russian or Kazakh. Tourists were milling about inside one of them, browsing rows of instant coffee, jade eggs and taxidermic hawks and antelopes. Outside, a row of golf carts and one stretch limousine waited to take the tourists back. I watched a group of women in ankle-length skirts cross a moonscape of rocks, heading toward China and dragging uselessly wheeled luggage behind them. When I asked Abaiuly about the prevalence of the carriers, he smiled. \u201cOn that subject I cannot speak,\u201d he said.\nAt an outdoor restaurant, I met a shashlik cook who lived inside one of the yurts where Chinese tourists ate. He left and re-entered the I.C.B.C. once a week to stay out of legal trouble, and said it was cheaper than living anywhere else.\nOne way to read the history of Central Asia is as a record of interactions between the mounted nomads who were long the primary occupants of the Eurasian Steppe and the sedentary populations who lived among them. As late as the 1930s, the dominant activity on the steppe was pastoral: herding sheep, goats and other livestock. Herders roamed in large, shifting clans on either side of the Tian Shan and Altai ranges, traveling on horseback and occasionally fragmenting or forming political alliances. These nomadic hordes proved unconquerable until the late 18th century, when they began to fall to Chinese conquest and, in what is now Kazakhstan, to Russian \u2014 later Soviet \u2014 rule.\nIn 1929, the leaders of the Soviet Union determined that Kazakhstan\u2019s pastoral work force would go to work on farms. This forced collectivization was framed as a civilizing mission to modernize a population whom many Russians had long viewed as primitive barbarians. Land formerly devoted to grazing was irrigated and turned over to wheat production, with the immediate result that around 90 percent of the country\u2019s livestock died. The subsequent famine caused the deaths of one-quarter of the population of Kazakhstan and anywhere from one-quarter to one-half of all ethnic Kazakhs, a human-made catastrophe that ended nomadism as it had been practiced in the region for thousands of years. Kazakhs became a minority in the nation the Soviets had founded in their name.\nNomadic pastoralism remains central to Kazakh mythology \u2014 Nazarbayev describes himself as \u201cthe son, grandson and great-grandson of herders\u201d \u2014 but as a practice it has retreated to the periphery of the country\u2019s economy. Most of the surviving herders in this part of Kazakhstan practice a form of seminomadism known as transhumance, alternating between winters in a low-altitude village and summers in a pasture, or zhailau, in the mountains. I wondered how those in the mountains above Khorgos were reacting to the economic foment that had emerged around their winter homes. One morning I visited a village of herders in the Zhongar Alatau, a northern stretch of the Tian Shan named for the last nomadic khanate to rule over the steppes of western China.\nIt was Friday, and most of the men were at the village mosque. I asked the local damkeeper\u2019s son, who said his name was Turar, to take me farther into the mountains where families graze their herds throughout the summer. I got into Turar\u2019s old Lada four-wheel drive, and we rattled and bounced up the edge of a steep bank that commanded a wide prospect of sand dunes and crumpled foothills. Hawks gyred overhead. I thought to myself that the beauty of Kazakhstan defied description, but Turar, who had lived here all his life, managed to capture its pristine emptiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like a screen,\u201d he said cryptically. Then, to clarify: \u201cLike a computer. Like the Windows screen.\u201d\nTo reach the zhailau, we left Turar\u2019s car at the dam where his family controls the flow of snowmelt and mountain spring through a Soviet-era irrigation canal. Before long, we arrived at an emerald slope where a single yurt sat embosomed in alpine lushness. Turar said this area was called the Black Gorge.\nA friend of Turar\u2019s emerged from the yurt, blinking at the sun. His name was Arsen Akhatay, and he\u2019d been napping. Every spring, he helped drive the family livestock, a few hundred sheep and 50 cows and horses, up to the zhailau and tended them. He returned to the village when school started in the fall, leaving his parents to drive the animals back down. In between, there was a lot of free time. Sometimes he passed it playing kokpar, a popular Central Asian sport in which players fight over a headless goat carcass while on horseback. Akhatay was the attacker on his local team and was meant to be at training camp this week for nationals, but he\u2019d fallen sick instead. He surveyed his sheep without enthusiasm. Each was labeled in resin with a large \u201c5\u201d marking it as a member of his family\u2019s flock. A solar panel staked into the ground near the doorway to the yurt powered a Chinese-made radio and a four-inch TV set. Turar gestured farther into the gorge, where Akhatay\u2019s family pastured their horses a mile or so in, and said that if you kept on in that direction, you\u2019d hit China.\nAkhatay was wearing a blue camouflage jacket, the kind worn by Kazakh police officers on field exercises. His cousin came out of the yurt wearing the same thing. During the school year they lived in a village near Zharkent called Turpan. Akhatay, who was about to start his senior year of high school, said he did not intend to look after sheep his whole life. I asked whether he wanted a job at Khorgos.\n\u201cMany people from the village work at the border as carriers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many official jobs but also many unofficial.\u201d All things being equal, he said, he wanted an official one. When he graduated, he planned to enroll at the military institute in Almaty to become a border guard.\nOn our drive down the mountain there was nothing to displease the eye, and before long we arrived at yet another small mountain village of white birches and potato gardens. Turar parked the car by a water pump and introduced me to a former classmate, a Kazakh named Zholaman Tashimkhan, who had come out to greet us.\nWe sat on the curb near the pump. Like Arsen, Tashimkhan spent most of the summer up in the mountains, but he was older and had already been drawn to the jobs at the border. He worked for a year for the railroad, a good job that is hard to come by through normal channels \u2014 \u201cI used my connections,\u201d he said, and laughed \u2014 but then his sister\u2019s husband found him work as a carrier. \u201cIt\u2019s not an official job,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a public job.\u201d\nA few men from the village began to gather around the pump as we talked. Tashimkhan explained that he had worked for a wholesaler based in Zharkent, crossing into the I.C.B.C. four or five days a week to bring household products, mostly bedsheets and linens, back into Kazakhstan. He was paid according to how much he managed to get through customs. On an average day, he might earn $15 or $20 \u2014 good money \u2014 and occasionally as much as $60. Customs enforcement was lax. \u201cFor us, you talk to the official working there, and you just bring things out,\u201d he said.\nMore villagers had come out to the road until they completed a circle around us. Tashimkhan changed the subject, then joked with a friend that he was starting to think he would regret talking to me. An older man who had been pacing the street squatted down beside us and began conspicuously sharpening a sickle a few inches from my head. Turar suggested it was time for us to continue down the mountain. We got into the Lada and drove off.\nThe great commonplace of our time also happens to be true: The world is more connected than ever before. But if it is more connected, the world is also more administered \u2014 its people more coerced and surveilled, more susceptible to the designs of authoritarian leaders and more dependent on the fortunes of mercurial international markets \u2014 than at any point in human history. If the first fact has made some parts of the world freer, the second has made the rest of it less so.\nA continuing trial at the local courthouse in Zharkent underscored this inversion, which seemed to me to lie at the heart of the developments at Khorgos. The case concerned Sayragul Sauytbay, a Chinese-born Kazakh woman who had fled Xinjiang and was requesting political asylum in Kazakhstan. Before the crackdown in Xinjiang, ethnic Kazakhs freely crossed the border to visit friends and relatives. But in 2016, as crossings became increasingly fraught, Sauytbay\u2019s husband and two children decided to move permanently to Kazakhstan. Sauytbay, who was working in Xinjiang as a kindergarten director, remained in China with plans to join them; the rest of the family became Kazakh citizens in 2017. For more than a year, they met only in the free-trade zone at the I.C.B.C.\nOn April 5, 2018, without telling anyone, Sauytbay entered the I.C.B.C. with forged identity papers, then slipped into Kazakhstan by posing as a member of a tour group. A few weeks later, she was arrested and charged with entering the country illegally, and then her story began to emerge. Not long after her family had left China, Sauytbay was assigned to work at one of Xinjiang\u2019s notorious detention camps. In her testimony, she described it as \u201ca prison in the mountains,\u201d with high walls and barbed wire that kept in some 2,500 inmates. She said she was forced by authorities to accept a teaching job there, indoctrinating the inmates in state propaganda, and she was warned that the penalty for revealing any information about the camps was death. The authorities confiscated her passport.\nAt her trial, Sauytbay provided some of the earliest testimony about life in Xinjiang\u2019s camps. Her case made headlines in Kazakhstan\u2019s national newspapers. She was married to a Kazakh citizen and was herself a \u201creturnee,\u201d a member of the diaspora of ethnic Kazakhs the government has been courting for years. But now prosecutors at Sauytbay\u2019s trial were arguing that she should be deported back to China, where she claimed she would be arrested or even killed for having made public her knowledge of the camps.\nMost people I\u2019d met in Almaty seemed to think she had little chance of receiving asylum, much less Kazakh citizenship. The acquittal rate in criminal trials in Kazakhstan is around 1 percent, and hasn\u2019t changed since the days of the Soviet Union. There was also the B.R.I. to consider. Kazakhstan might decide Chinese investment was more important than any international agreements on refugees. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a country was so swayed. In 2017, Greece vetoed a European Union statement criticizing China\u2019s human rights record at the United Nations, a decision that critics linked to China\u2019s controlling interest not just in Greece\u2019s largest port but also in its public power grid. In January, China hosted a Silk Road Celebrity China Tour, inviting journalists from six B.R.I. partner countries \u2014 Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2014 on a highly choreographed tour of a \u201cvocational center\u201d in Kashgar, another famous stop on the ancient Silk Road. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, the visitors uniformly \u201cpraised the development and stability\u201d of Xinjiang. An editor from Bangladesh singled out the region\u2019s contributions \u201cto the nonoccurrence of violence and terrorism.\u201d\nMy last day in town coincided with what turned out to be the last day of Sauytbay\u2019s trial. About 100 supporters had risen early and driven out from Almaty to the courthouse, which was opposite a park where marble busts of Soviet heroes watched over a playground. When the courtroom opened, the crowd crushed against the glass doors. I made it through with a handful of other reporters thanks to some strategic shoving by a few veteran activists; most of the crowd remained on the courthouse steps.\nAs the proceedings began, Sauytbay\u2019s lawyer introduced into evidence a copy of the asylum application that she had just filed. Both the judge and prosecutor interrogated Sauytbay, who from behind a clear protective wall related how, when she was arrested by the Kazakh police, an official told her that she would be sent back to China to die and her children would become orphans.\nSauytbay freely admitted she\u2019d escaped China illegally. She was willing to serve a prison sentence. She just didn\u2019t want to be sent back. \u201cThere is no reason for me to live if I am not with my children,\u201d she told the judge. Her family sat across the room, near an open window through which we could hear the crowd murmuring outside.\nThe prosecution had previously rejected any kind of a plea deal. So what happened next was that rare thing: a dramatic courtroom reversal. In a closing statement, the prosecutor cited the outpouring of support the case had received across Kazakhstan. She requested that the judge allow Sauytbay to serve out a period of probation at her husband\u2019s house. \u201cI ask you not to apply deportation,\u201d she said. \u201cI ask you to set her free in the courtroom.\u201d Sauytbay\u2019s eyes went wide. Her lawyer, who seemed stunned, agreed. A few moments later, sounds of cheering rang out on the courthouse steps.\n\u201cI was surprised the law was kept,\u201d Rysbek Sarsenbay, a prominent opposition activist, told me later. He reasoned that the government must have weighed the consequences of deporting Sauytbay carefully against the risk of alienating China\u2019s leadership. \u201cEven as a dictatorship,\u201d he said, \u201cKazakhstan must honor its international commitments.\u201d\nOnce the judge issued the expected ruling \u2014 prosecutors and judges in Kazakhstan rarely disagree \u2014 Sauytbay was ushered from the courthouse to the top of the steps, where she embraced her son and thanked President Nazarbayev for his beneficence. A poet took the stage to extemporize a victory verse in Kazakh. The crowd repaired to a restaurant a few miles outside Zharkent, where a spontaneous release party began with the singing of the national anthem. Waiters descended with plates of beshbarmak, a national dish of boiled noodles and horse meat in onion sauce. When Sauytbay arrived, holding her son in her arms, everyone stood up and clapped. She told me she hoped her testimony would \u201cshine a light of hope\u201d for her compatriots in China. \u201cThey know there is a country that will always protect them,\u201d she said.\nThe celebration may have been premature. As Sauytbay later told The Globe and Mail of Toronto, within a day of her release, her sister and two friends were arrested in Xinjiang \u2014 they have since disappeared into camps \u2014 and in October Kazakhstan denied Sauytbay\u2019s asylum claim. For the time being, she is living at home with her family, but her legal status in Kazakhstan is uncertain.\nEven if she manages to avoid deportation, Sauytbay is one of thousands of people with ties to Kazakhstan who have found themselves caught up in Xinjiang\u2019s detention centers. At the release party, I found myself sitting next to a Kazakh woman named Qarlyghash Ziparova, whose nephew, a former Xinjiang official named Askar Azatbek, had disappeared inside the ostensibly neutral free trade zone of the I.C.B.C. Azatbek, who had become a Kazakh citizen a few months earlier, entered the I.C.B.C. in 2017 with a friend, whereupon a group of men drove up in two cars and detained them. The friend was released, but Azatbek was hauled off. They hadn\u2019t even been on the Chinese side, the friend had said. Ziparova tried to complain to authorities in Kazakhstan, but without any luck. The I.C.B.C. told her there was no surveillance video, although she didn\u2019t believe it. She didn\u2019t understand how a Kazakh citizen could be taken away by China like that \u2014 without even a trial.\nThe ancient Silk Road was equal parts trade route and social network. The routes themselves were in constant flux and administered by no one, and they succeeded through incremental growth and local knowledge in response to changing needs \u2014 the exact opposite of the Ozymandian ambitions and sweeping autocratic statecraft that characterize the Belt and Road. For all its potential to create jobs and modernize infrastructures, the project has also created a halo of mass internment camps for the powerless and gray-market economies for the poor. While new official jobs in Khorgos are lifting a lucky few out of poverty, it is far more common to find farmers and herders moonlighting as taxi drivers, security guards or smugglers, part of a precarious network of low-paid freelancers. Such work is susceptible by design to sudden changes in enforcement and depends on a constant influx of disposable workers. It seemed like a high cost for connecting the world.\nI hired a taxi to drive me back to Almaty. We took a new highway that opened last year, part of a growing highway system affiliated with the B.R.I. and known as the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor. The highway cuts the travel time in half, from six hours to just over three hours, and driving atop it felt like riding an air-hockey puck. There were no rest stops or gas stations, and the few landmarks I could see stood at an unobtrusive distance. They included an old train station, a pumping house for a Chinese oil pipeline and the alien forms of a half-built wind farm courtesy of SANY Group, the Chinese manufacturing behemoth. As the sun became a narrow red eye on the horizon, a dust storm descended the cliffs to our left and crossed the road into empty veld. There were no cars in sight. It was less a road than the idea of a road.\nThe driver didn\u2019t know anything about the trial whose outcome I had just seen. He had never heard of Sayragul Sauytbay. He was happy to have such a fine new highway on which to drive his customers back and forth between Khorgos and Almaty. Kazakhstan, we agreed, was a beautiful country. He pointed to some fields he said would be full of cattle in the fall, then opened the sunroof and stuck his hand into the night air.\nThis article was researched with support from New York University\u2019s Matthew Power Literary Reporting Award.\nBen Mauk is a writer based in Berlin.

The novelist, Salman Rushdie, author of ''The Satanic Verses,'' said he was taking the threat seriously.\nThe Teheran radio quoted Ayatollah Khomeini as asking ''all the Muslims to execute them,'' referring to Mr. Rushdie, who lives in London, and the publishers of the book, Viking Penguin, ''wherever they find them.''\nHe said that anyone killed carrying out his order would be considered a martyr.\nMr. Rushdie's American agent said there were no plans to call off the author's American promotional tour. All was quiet at Viking Penguin's offices in New York, but a guard there said security was tight.\nThreat Taken 'Very Seriously'\nWednesday was declared a day of mourning in Iran to protest the novel. It has prompted violent protests by Islamic fundamentalists over the author's projection of Islamic myths and Koranic motifs in contemporary and futuristic settings, which many\ncontend is blasphemous.\n''The author of the 'Satanic Verses' book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death,'' said Ayatollah Khomeini, whose\nword is considered law by millions of Shiite Muslims. ''If someone knows them but is unable to kill them, he should hand them over to the people for punishment.''\nMr. Rushdie, who is 41 years old and was born into a Kashmiri Muslim family in Bombay, could not be reached by The New York Times for comment today. But he was quoted as telling the British Broadcasting Corporation that he had to take the threat ''very\nseriously indeed'' and that he ''may well have to think about'' applying to the authorities for protection.\n''I am very sad it should have happened,'' Mr. Rushdie was quoted by the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, as saying. ''It is not true this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much Khomeini\nor anyone else in Iran has read the book or anything more than selected extracts taken out of context.''\nBritain's Foreign Office said today that clarification was being sought over Ayatollah Khomeini's remarks, which, ''if true, are a cause for concern.'' [ A leader of the British Muslims, quoted by Reuters, added grave concern\nto the security situation late tonight by reinforcing Ayatollah Khomeini's call for Mr. Rushdie's execution. Said Abdul Quddas, joint secretary of the Council of Mosques in the northern English city of Bradford,\ntold reporters, ''Every good Muslim is after his life. He has tortured Islam and has to pay the penalty. He deserves hanging. [ ''There are any number of people who would willingly carry out what to\nus would not be a crime but a justified act.'' ] A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to comment on the threat. However, British newspapers said the Special Branch of Scotland Yard was protecting Mr. Rushdie,\nadding that a team of armed officers was probably assigned to accompany the author. Special Branch officers will also increase surveillance on Muslim fundamentalist groups in London and throughout Britain, the agency said.\nThe Khomeini statement came amid a wave of protests and attempts to ban the book. On Sunday, a mob of thousands of enraged Muslims tried to enter and destroy the American cultural center in Islamabad, Pakistan, because Mr. Rushdie's book is being\npublished in the United States. The attack left five people dead and more than 100 people wounded; three people died in similar disturbances in India on Monday.\nMuslims in Britain burned copies of the book last month and W. H. Smith booksellers withdrew it from public display in Bradford, a city in the north that has a large Moslem community.\nThe Press Association quoted Mr. Rushdie's literary agent in Britain, Gillon Aitken, as saying that the author had been ''out and about,'' in response to a question about whether he was in hiding today.\n''I assume he has been getting on with his life,'' Mr. Aitken said.\n''The Satanic Verses'' begins with a plane crash over the English Channel in which two men survive to be ''born again,'' one with a halo, the other with slowly developing horns and hoofs. It is not clear, despite\ntheir appearance, which of them is good and which is evil. They become involved with characters named Alleluia Cone and Mahound, the latter a businessman turned prophet who lives in the imaginary city of Jahilla.\n'A Dirty Conspiracy'\nMr. Rushdie's character the Prophet Mahound resembles the portrayal of Jesus Christ in Martin Scorsese's film ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' in that Mahound is depicted as having a human nature and wrestling with temptation.\nThe work is clearly perceived as offensive to Islam, but what exactly is regarded as insulting has not been spelled out.\nThe Iranian Government condemned the book as ''a dirty conspiracy'' against Islam and urged followers of Ayatollah Khomeini around the world to take action against it. A Government statement read on the Teheran radio called for cells\nof the Party of God -devotees of the Ayatollah and a group of them in Lebanon is believed to be holding Westerners who are missing and believed kidnapped there - to take ''necessary steps to neutralize this plot.''\n''We call on all Party of God cells in the world of Islam to grasp the depth of this black conspiracy,'' the statement said. ''We advise all Islamic Governments not to place themselves against the million masses of angry\nMuslims but to demonstrate their disgust and anger, together with their nation, towards this provocative American deed.''\nThe Iranian press agency quoted Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi as calling Mr. Rushdie an ''American mercenary.''\nMr. Rushdie was quoted as telling Independent Television News here that he doubted that those conducting a campaign against the book were trying to act as ''thought police.''\nReturn to the Books Home Page", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The output would be a WeWork. So much serene, lavish and mechanical attention is allocated to every detail: the neon and the daybeds and the fiddle-leaf figs, the wallpaper and the playlists and the typefaces. The newest iteration of its ever-emergent design concept may be indebted to Luis Barrag\u00e1n and Carlo Scarpa, but the degree of thought and investment that goes into its terrarium construction is something its busy occupants are expected to register only as background noise. WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.\nThere\u2019s also free top-shelf coffee, the sort of minor frill most office workers might take for granted in a way the self-employed never would. One premise of the company\u2019s existence is that it\u2019s good business to provide such minor luxuries to the otherwise unfrilled. The coffee \u2014 and the draft kombucha, which has come to supplement beer as WeWork distances itself from the frattier aspects of entrepreneurship \u2014 is, at any rate, only part of an environment engineered for felicitous exchange. This strategy is supported by narrow hallways, boxy plate-glass enclosures, distant bathrooms and centralized fruit-water dispensers, but the company\u2019s architects never indulged the belief that if they built it, people would come. The spaces themselves are the staging ground for yoga classes, wine tastings, make-your-own-trail-mix bars and vendor workshops about how to cut cloud costs. For what remains of life outside the workplace, there are cross-promotional discounts on 1-800-Flowers.com and Crunch gym memberships.\nMost of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work, and it\u2019s easy to object to WeWork\u2019s thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle. Once you get accustomed to the basic product, however, it\u2019s hard not to find it ... pretty nice. Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.\n[Housecleaners, nannies, health aides and domestic workers are organizing to secure job security. Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue.]\nMy \u201chome\u201d location \u2014 on North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, next to the Whole Foods across from the Apple store \u2014 was proposed to me, by WeWork\u2019s unusually thoughtful and candid public-relations representatives, as a particularly strong example of the company\u2019s \u201ccommunity layer\u201d at work. The \u201ccommunity manager,\u201d Natalie, is a luminous young woman with flaming scarlet hair and a rockabilly swagger. She started as the location\u2019s first front-desk associate and rose quickly to her current role as operational czar, personal concierge and on-call therapist; she has also been recruited, in her capacity as a \u201ctheatrical jazz pop\u201d singer, to perform at companywide events. She has first-name-basis relationships with everybody. She knows when the printer by the sunglasses and accessories manufacturer is going to run out, and when Ulrik, the chief executive of the Danish software-platform company that is the location\u2019s largest tenant, is arriving on a red-eye and will require early-hours access. She was quick to put together canned-food and used-clothing drives on the occasions of disasters, and encouraged everyone to sign up for a marrow-donor registry. Community managers remember people\u2019s birthdays and their preferences in candy or whiskey and their dogs\u2019 preferences in treats.\nWeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.\nIf Natalie was everyone\u2019s favorite quasi comptroller, it was clear that everyone\u2019s favorite quasi co-worker was a young accountant named Mabel Luna. When she was 18, Mabel moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx. She put herself through school and worked for three of the Big Four accounting firms until she decided her heart was not in capital markets but in small companies. It was the idea of her own office, which she selected before the space had a floor, that gave her the confidence to start a business \u2014 a common sentiment at WeWork and one I heard particularly often from women and people of color \u2014 and on move-in day, she hung up her shingle as a private C.P.A. Though she never advertised, she quickly outgrew herself; she told me that 90 percent of her customers have come through WeWork, either via hallway run-ins or through the social-networking features of its mobile app. She had several clients in the building \u2014 including a brewer of natural alcoholic kombucha, a sole-proprietor attorney and the German sunglasses manufacturer by the printer \u2014 and saw herself as much more than an arm\u2019s-length contractor. The only real glitch was that her friend-client-colleagues were constantly stopping by to rap on her window with a quick question about cash flow or depreciation, or to ask if she could spare an hour for a kombucha-tasting panel or some volunteer hand-modeling. During tax season, she felt as though she had to leave WeWork to get any work done.\nThe relentless sociability inspired by WeWork was always one of the founders\u2019 aims, even as the composition of its membership has changed. When the company first opened in 2010, its spaces catered to entrepreneurs. The founders soon understood that the increasingly fluid and anxious labor market \u2014 its conditions exacerbated by the downturn but likely to exist in perpetuity \u2014 presented them with a much larger potential customer base. Uber and TaskRabbit and other labor-platform intermediaries positioned themselves to match those who needed something done with those who needed something to do, but they based their recruitment drives on a cynical reading of the economic mood. The subway I took to WeWork was plastered with tough-love ads from services like Fiverr, which made naked appeals to stoic virtues. (\u201cActually, it hasn\u2019t all been done before\u201d; \u201cIn doers we trust\u201d; \u201cReading about starting your own business is like reading about having sex.\u201d)\nThat sort of campaign felt manipulative: The platforms\u2019 emphasis on self-reliance for the economically precarious merely disguised their rent-seeking. WeWork, by contrast, just charged rent. The company was perceptive enough to realize that disaggregated workers (or at least those of a certain class) did not want to hear that they should just kill it on their own, bro. They wanted to hear that nobody ever can. What WeWork offered was not just rhetoric \u2014 a more sympathetic description of the restless, fretful life of the deinstitutionalized worker \u2014 but true shelter from a pervasive sense of alienation. Where Fiverr issued an invitation to gladiatorial combat, WeWork promised a work environment remodeled for solace and dignity.\nThus is the business model of WeWork, recently valued at $47 billion, now only facially about commercial subletting. All its accessories serve to buttress its real product: \u201coffice culture\u201d as a service. When people at the company try to explain that culture, they invariably resort to talk of positive energy sources and the obligation to heal the social fabric \u2014 a vocabulary traditionally associated with utopian architecture, 1980s academic communitarianism or ayahuasca experimentation. They affirm that all the ostensibly small incremental niceties add up to more than the sum of their parts, and on some level I couldn\u2019t help agreeing. The market certainly seems to. As of this January, WeWork has 400,000 members in 425 locations in 27 countries, at least 30 percent of whom are employees of large existing businesses. This latter category has helped double that membership in only a year. Some of these enterprise customers are merely outsourcing their facilities management the way they outsource manufacturing or payroll; others anticipate the revitalization \u2014 or even wholesale procurement \u2014 of their corporate culture. The conviction behind the rapid growth of WeWork is that the office culture of the future is likely to be the culture of the future, full stop, and that it is WeWork\u2019s special vocation to bring it to market.\nThe idea of \u201ccorporate culture,\u201d long before it was identified and cultivated as such, emerged as a solution to the problems of the large, distributed mass-industrial firm. Ransom Olds is credited with inventing the concept of the assembly line in 1901, and it was over the following decades that businesses began to feel an imperative to address the question of what work was supposed to \u201cmean.\u201d This was both an internal bottom-line matter \u2014 employees who toiled in exchange for only a paycheck were difficult to retain and unlikely to prioritize efficiency or innovation \u2014 and a social one. By midcentury, large companies like the car manufacturers had come to represent the predominant institutional affiliation for legions of American men. Even if these firms had no explicit philanthropic interest in civic cohesion, they certainly had a stake in the preservation of the social order. If they could invest piecemeal labor with something like dignity, they could neutralize the political and economic threats posed by union solidarity.\nWhat they arrived at was a generic set of strategies, applicable at any industrial organization, designed to help workers recognize the value of their personal contributions to the final product. The classic formulation of this approach was Peter Drucker\u2019s \u201cConcept of the Corporation\u201d; though it\u2019s now seen \u2014 if not much read \u2014 as a foundational text in the study of management, it reads like a sober contribution to midcentury sociology. The simplest form of recognition is advancement. Workers, Drucker believed, ought to be viewed not as exploitable resources but as human capital to be fostered, and thus provided with the training necessary to secure a path upward. Programs like project rotations \u2014 which exposed otherwise specialized employees to the breadth of company operations \u2014 should be put in place even if they seemed, in the short term, economically irrational; in the long term, they represented an investment in worker potential. Employees unlikely to advance might more gladly accept their place in the corporate scheme when given a holistic perspective on production: The maker of a car\u2019s door hinge, for example, might be shown where his discrete, repetitive effort fits into the fully realized car.\nThe anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined culture as a collective act of interpretation, the stories we tell one another about ourselves in an attempt to make ongoing sense of why we do what we do. A car manufacturer could just point to a sensible Oldsmobile, something the world self-evidently needed. Because cars were public goods, corporate culture could easily borrow its energy from civic culture.\nIt could also borrow civic culture\u2019s prevailing norms \u2014 and, in turn, reinforce them. The management classic \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d describes how Walt Disney, for example, did not manage a corporation so much as lord over an extended brood of subordinates, each of them expected not only to abide by the letter of company decorum but also to embody its founder\u2019s spirit. Hourly theme-park workers were held to an imperious standard of personal upkeep: for men, no facial hair; for women, no dangly earrings or excessive makeup. As one biographer described it, \u201cWhen someone did, on occasion, slip in Walt\u2019s presence and use a four-letter word in mixed company, the result was always immediate dismissal, no matter what type of professional inconvenience the firing caused.\u201d The people making the country\u2019s cars could be forgiven a coarse exclamation; the people making the country\u2019s cartoons were held to a loftier code.\nAs the economy shifted from industrial manufacturing to the service and knowledge sectors, it became increasingly necessary for businesses to articulate their \u201ccore purpose\u201d as an organizational and motivational principle \u2014 and a way to differentiate \u201ctheir\u201d ethereal knowledge work from whatever it was other companies\u2019 employees did. The separation of corporate culture in particular from general civic culture was also encouraged by the ascendancy of free-market economics; Milton Friedman told executives that their sole remit was to tend to their own shareholder garden. Shared goals, while important, ought to be strictly values-agnostic.\nAn intrinsic and well-elaborated corporate mission was seen as a crucial competitive advantage. \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d examined, as a comparative case study, cultural differences in the tobacco sector. As the authors put it, \u201cwe saw in Philip Morris an esprit de corps and sense of common purpose that we simply did not see over the last 30 years at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives have appeared far more passionate about their cigarettes than the executives at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives express much more defiance in their prosmoking ideology, whereas the R.J.R. folks after about 1960 did not seem to care much about the products except as a way to make money. ... The Philip Morris executives, in contrast, framed the fight over cigarettes in almost self-righteous moral overtones: We have a right to smoke; it\u2019s a matter of freedom of choice. Don\u2019t take away our cigarettes. Don\u2019t tread on me!\u201d One former employee told them that \u201cthe company forced upon her and her co-workers boxes of cigarettes to take home with their paychecks.\u201d\nImplicit in all this was the acknowledgment that corporate work was not a clear-cut transaction but a complicated relationship. The difference between a contractor and an employee was that the employee accepted the benefits of security and attention along with the costs of unspecified professional obligations \u2014 the sum of which could be called culture. This paternalistic ethos in mainstream corporate America has long seemed aesthetically dour, economically inefficient and morally retrograde. \u201cCorporate culture\u201d today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities. Given the structure of our current economy, most companies understand that it\u2019s in the best interests of the shareholders to call it even: They\u2019ve withdrawn the Disney-like benefits as well as the Disney-like expectations and set their employees \u201cfree.\u201d\nWeWork has stepped into this breach, purporting to offer the best of both worlds. On the one hand, it speaks the language of autonomy: You can choose to sit at a table or a booth or a couch, you can come and go as you please, and if you rent an actual office, you can decorate it like a tiki bar or a nuclear submarine if you fancy it. On the other, however, it speaks the language of belonging, awarding freelancers like me the chance to go to office holiday parties, to feel as if our lives have been enlivened by the scuttlebutt around the ambiently professional boathouse. With a stable corporate culture, especially in a unionized shop, these two wants aren\u2019t contradictory: Solidarity among colleagues can give strength and definition to any individual employee\u2019s sense of independence. But in the floating economy that WeWork equips, there\u2019s something uneasy about the company\u2019s \u00e0 la carte promises.\n'Corporate culture' today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities.\nThe primary evidence for WeWork\u2019s faith in its own corporate calling \u2014 to be the universal purveyor of energy and community \u2014 is internal. The two big collective imprinting events on the company calendar each year are Summer Camp, a tent revival, and a wintertime Summit, a three-day carnival for thousands of employees. In January last year, the event took place in a cavernous theater underneath Madison Square Garden. The ratio of M.S.G. employees to WeWork attendees seemed to be approximately one to one, and the two groups faced off with a kind of looking-glass symmetry: on the one side, union sweatshirts and jackets for the electricians and security guards, and on the other, young people in \u201cWomen of WeWork\u201d or \u201cWe of Color\u201d or \u201cEast Region\u201d or \u201cCreated in China\u201d team T-shirts and sturdy outerwear over the standard-issue gray-heather CREATOR undershirts. The assembled WeWorkforce \u2014 which is, for a tech company, exceptionally diverse, gender-balanced and bizarrely attractive \u2014 had a relaxed cool that clashed with the atmosphere of corporate sentimentality. In the background, an inspirational video invited attendees to imagine \u201csomething that\u2019s greater than any one of us.\u201d Everyone present was \u201cpart of a new generation \u2014 the \u2018We\u2019 generation.\u201d\nOn the first full day of internal talks, Miguel McKelvey, a founder of the company and its chief culture officer, took the stage in a purple-heather \u201cWe of Color\u201d T-shirt. A keystone of company lore is that he grew up in a matriarchal collective in Oregon. (The other founder, Adam Neumann, grew up in part on a kibbutz; today, according to recent reports, he collects millions of dollars from WeWork as one of its landlords.) McKelvey explained that thus far the company had been associated with \u201centrepreneurs, start-ups, freelancers, and that\u2019s who we typically think of as the innovative people in our world.\u201d This was a characteristic WeWork sleight of hand, insofar as he was referring both to the employees present and to the current well of members; the company has a classic \u201cI\u2019m not just the president \u2014 I\u2019m also a member\u201d mentality. Over the last few years, he went on, \u201clarger companies thought: WeWork seems cool. We should put our teams into WeWork locations.\u201d\nThis was all prelude to McKelvey\u2019s announcement that the company was radically expanding its courtship of enterprise customers \u2014 offering a suite of \u201cspace as a service\u201d options under the new rubric Powered by We. WeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork. Some companies, like Liberty Mutual (Boston) and Nasdaq (New York), have simply taken a floor or two in a WeWork location. Others, like IBM (New York), have moved into entire buildings. WeWork\u2019s most enthusiastic customers \u2014 UBS (Weehawken, N.J.) and Sprint (Kansas City) are two of the biggest examples \u2014 have engaged the company\u2019s bespoke services from planning through build-out to management.\nVeresh Sita, an executive in charge of this novel product line, appeared onstage and asked us to close our eyes and \u201cimagine a workplace \u2014 imagine a workplace where you can create a life; imagine a workplace that\u2019s so much more than an office, desks and infrastructure; imagine a workplace built on your needs \u2014 physically and digitally.\u201d When we opened our eyes, he reminded us that most people did not have that privilege. \u201cEighty-five percent of employees at enterprise businesses do not feel engaged today.\u201d\nThe screen behind him flashed a beige sea of barren cubicles. \u201cFifty-one percent of employees at enterprise companies are currently looking for a job.\u201d What these companies needed was a better \u201cworkplace experience.\u201d Sita showed before-and-after slides of one firm\u2019s transformation. The first showed a collection of yellowing chairs scattered desolately around white laminate cafeteria tables; the second showed what we were to understand as the same space reborn as an open loft, with gales of natural light reflecting off the herringbone parquet and the emerald shoots of their ubiquitous succulents. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you even call the first one,\u201d he said. \u201cDeath row?\u201d\nFrom an investor\u2019s perspective, WeWork\u2019s pivot to culture has been a business necessity. The company takes out large commercial leases \u2014 initially entire floors, later buildings \u2014 and subdivides the floor plans into \u201cstorefront\u201d units with the size and flexibility designed to suit start-ups. As plenty of discriminating observers have pointed out, this business model is vulnerable to some huge macroeconomic risks: On the \u201csupply\u201d side of commercial leases, the company has little control over costs, while on the \u201cdemand\u201d side, its (highly elastic) product risks feeling like an easily duplicated commodity. And so, from the perspective of both investors and customers, it\u2019s paramount that WeWork not be seen as purely a real estate arbitrageur. The focus on \u201cculture\u201d affords it a kind of magical penumbra of workplace retrofuturism.\nIf the company\u2019s \u201cCultureOS\u201d excuses it from the harsh realities of commercial real estate, it also affords it an opportunity to differentiate its product from the \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d of the pure technology companies. It has collected an enormous amount of workplace data and has developed experimental desks that will feature personalized height and temperature settings, all of which could easily be exploited by productivity-hawk employers, but much of its CultureOS is oriented to \u201cwork-life balance.\u201d This could be flexibly interpreted. The Summit events included a panel with two community managers at enterprise locations. One was told by a client company never to plan events on Fridays, because people just didn\u2019t come in that day. But the community manager and her team went ahead and scheduled the sort of social calendar they were used to, and, she said, \u201clast Friday at 6:30 p.m., there were people playing Jenga and drinking beer.\u201d People who would usually leave at 3 or 4 were staying later than they ever had. Remote employees were now coming in every day; one was suddenly around so much that he was asked if he\u2019d relocated from the suburbs to the city, but the answer was no. \u201cEven if I have to commute every day for five hours,\u201d he apparently continued, \u201cI want to be here.\u201d\nThe community manager was confident that something as casual as weekly happy hours had been revolutionary to their new clients. \u201cExecutives who would otherwise be hiding out in private offices are now being peer-pressured to come out and hang with their direct reports. We are destroying hierarchy.\u201d\nWhen I met McKelvey a few weeks later at WeWork\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, he made it clear that the long-term plan was not just to make IBM a bit more like Google but something much more grandiose. The company\u2019s CultureOS was about being \u201csupportive to openness and conversation\u201d and the \u201cobligation we create to each other to be good humans to each other \u2014 to share a smile and some warmth.\u201d We\u2019ve learned the hard way from social media, he said, that \u201calignment along ideological lines is a shallow way of creating a human environment.\u201d This, McKelvey said, is what he tells his team: \u201cYou\u2019re not building work space. You\u2019re here building a new infrastructure to rebuild social fabric and rebuild up the potential for human connection.\u201d It was, he conceded, a \u201cbig leap.\u201d But the company existed to give it a shot. \u201cWho am I going to need in a disaster? The person I took a yoga class with versus the person I\u2019m in the same Facebook group with?\u201d The enterprise product could scale up that social infrastructure to unite millions and millions of people. On a hard-hat tour of WeWork\u2019s new West Coast headquarters, in San Francisco\u2019s Salesforce Tower, Adam Neumann told me: \u201cAssuming we keep up our personal growth as a company, as individuals and as a company, there is no limit. Businesses, neighborhoods, cities \u2014 there are new cities being built around the world, and we want the call from those cities.\u201d\nWeWork is not so na\u00efve as to think that narrow hallways, happy hours, Taco Tuesdays and yoga are going to revive the workplace as a locus of societal coherence. But it thinks that thousands of Natalies remembering the birthdays of thousands of Mabel Lunas might, and it\u2019s to its sincere credit that \u2014 unlike most other technology companies, but like most religions \u2014 it recognizes that meaning at scale is a high-touch business, and it seems prepared to invest in labor costs that, even if they\u2019re drawn from the low-wage hospitality sector, will grow linearly with expansion. When I spoke to representatives of Powered by We customers, they were highly appreciative of a partnership that gave their employees at the very least better access to informal common spaces.\nAnd WeWork is right to perceive that it provides its members with a heightened sense of social organization. To join WeWork is to feel gently buoyed along in a strange kind of substrate, neither fully adrift nor fully anchored, loosely bound to others by novel waveforms. These ties alternately resemble deals between independent contractors, collaborations between colleagues, flirtations between strangers and intimacy between friends \u2014 and insofar as they muddy the boundaries between these things, they ultimately feel like none of them. There is a near-imaginable WeWorld in which all human endeavor outsources itself to associations of WeNodes that in an eternal churn arise as spontaneously as they disperse. If a very clever combination of architecture, technology and hospitality serves as an analgesic for the disaggregated, it can just as easily function as a solvent for the institutions that remain.\nThis might not be such a bad thing, especially for certain types of \u201ccreatives\u201d and \u201cinnovators,\u201d but it\u2019s hard to see where community will take root and culture will flower. WeWork\u2019s executives might believe that people are lonely and atomized because our social infrastructure has been degraded, but the problem is not that we lack opportunities to brush up against one another. They confuse the possibility of interaction with the incentive and desire to interact; they confuse their own set decoration for the provision of a common script. You cannot put a bunch of random actors on a stage and expect them to fumble their way toward a play. When a spirit of community does unfold ex nihilo in one of their spaces, the simplest explanation is selection bias: When they open locations based on proximity to a Whole Foods or an Apple store, they are masking the sorting mechanism they\u2019ve used to build their brand.\nWeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork.\nAs for me, I never went to any of those free yoga classes; I suppose I can\u2019t really speak for Williamsburg\u2019s other members, but perhaps that\u2019s the point. I was an extracurricular truant in part because I liked my own yoga classes just fine and in part because the WeWork events I did attend were so networky. Also, I always had too much work. It\u2019s tempting to underline the paradox that, in my case, a WeWork yoga class could very plausibly have counted as work, but then again the very same could be said for any of North Fourth Street\u2019s accountants or kombucha marketers \u2014 not to make allies in anticipation of disaster but to trawl for more clients and contractors.\nAnd I didn\u2019t really care to go to the holiday party either. The anarchic thrill of a masquerade is electrifying only insofar as it feels genuinely remissive: A harvest ritual only makes sense as a reprieve from the collective sacrifices of the season. One thing that executives at Philip Morris and Disney understood was that cultures succeed in the attempt to organize and structure human behavior only when they address both what you are permitted to do and what you are obligated to do. \u201cDo what you love\u201d is only half a culture; what\u2019s missing is the idea that there might be some deep reward, beyond the gratification of self-discipline, for doing what you have to do even when you don\u2019t love it \u2014 in other words, for doing work. An authority that can\u2019t compel is not an authority that can protect or inspire.\nWeWork\u2019s own precedent puts its employees in an excellent position to understand this dynamic. A recent executive mandate declared the company a \u201cmeat-free\u201d organization. When I interviewed McKelvey not long after the Summit, he had a very fuzzy time trying to explain the meaning of the \u201ceight pillars\u201d of its CultureOS and the relationships among them. But when he noticed that the P.R. representative happened to be carrying a single-use plastic water bottle, he admonished her to be mindful of her own consumption. For all the company\u2019s vaulting ambition to build the workplace of the future, this was much closer to Walt Disney than Milton Friedman.\nOver the past year, as WeWork has been folded into what is now called the We Company \u2014 which encompasses WeGrow, its school, and WeLive, its communal housing projects \u2014 its Powered by We product has been refined and formalized. Recently, I met with Lakshmi Rengarajan, its director of workplace connection and a recent recruit from Match.com, and Craig Robinson, a veteran of commercial real estate who now served as global head of Powered by We Services, along with two P.R. representatives; the company\u2019s data show that people prefer small conference rooms to medium-size ones, and the five of us were pressed into intimacy by the vitrine they\u2019d reserved.\nRengarajan and Robinson were careful to italicize the idea that they\u2019re not trying to foist their own strong, participatory, idiosyncratic culture on anybody else\u2019s shop. Their services, while inspired by and grounded in the company\u2019s internal environment, begin with WeWork\u2019s tailored attempts to understand the client\u2019s own organizational structure and needs. They did, of course, have a repertoire of connective practices that seemed to them universally valuable. Rengarajan told me that \u201cthe first step toward someone being seen as a full human\u201d was to begin with something as simple as a round of stories about where people\u2019s first names came from; she explained that a former boss, unable for some reason to pronounce the name Lakshmi, had simply called her Sue. Robinson, who had personally experienced Rengarajan\u2019s exercise twice, said that the activity made it easy to remember Rengarajan because her name meant she was born on a Monday. \u201cOr maybe it wasn\u2019t Monday?\u201d\n\u201cFriday,\u201d she said, and laughed.\nBut they were not so presumptuous as to expect that Sprint or UBS would have a cafeteria that served no meat. I wondered how far they would extend themselves to help a firm help its employees to do what they loved. Would they be willing to work with, say, Philip Morris? Everyone tried to sustain simultaneous eye contact with me while they all paused to give it some thought.\n\u201cThat,\u201d each repeated in turn with total, collective sincerity, \u201cis a great question.\u201d They were going to have to talk about it.\nGideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.

Many..\n...people not interviewed, including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?\nAs it has turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!\nUranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!\nWorkers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it, Russia, the FBI or the Dems (or all)?\n.@foxandfriends \"Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation\"\nOfficials behind the now discredited \"Dossier\" plead the Fifth. Justice Department and/or FBI should immediately release who paid for it.\nCrooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!\n\"Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President.\" @FoxNews\nIt is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!\nNever seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....\n...the Uranium to Russia deal, the 33,000 plus deleted Emails, the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,....\n...\"collusion,\" which doesn't exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R's...\n...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!\nAll of this \"Russia\" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!\nReport out that Obama Campaign paid $972,000 to Fusion GPS. The firm also got $12,400,000 (really?) from DNC. Nobody knows who OK'd!\nSorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????\n....Also, there is NO COLLUSION!\nThe Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was \"no collusion\" and events mentioned took place long before he...\n....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!\nThe biggest story yesterday, the one that has the Dems in a dither, is Podesta running from his firm. What he know about Crooked Dems is....\n....earth shattering. He and his brother could Drain The Swamp, which would be yet another campaign promise fulfilled. Fake News weak!\nDonna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H....\n....This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering - where is our Justice Department?\nThe @TuckerCarlson opening statement about our once cherished and great FBI was so sad to watch. James Comey's leadership was a disaster!\nEverybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn't looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems..\n...New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus...\n....People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!\nThe real story on Collusion is in Donna B's new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!\nPocahontas just stated that the Democrats, lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton, rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.\nThe rigged Dem Primary, one of the biggest political stories in years, got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!\nDoes the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also, but he had zero chemistry with Putin.\nSince the first day I took office, all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election, Russia, Russia,Russia. Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\nCharles McCullough, the respected fmr Intel Comm Inspector General, said public was misled on Crooked Hillary Emails. \u201cEmails endangered National Security.\u201d Why aren't our deep State authorities looking at this? Rigged & corrupt? @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity\nThe House of Representatives seeks contempt citations(?) against the JusticeDepartment and the FBI for withholding key documents and an FBI witness which could shed light on surveillance of associates of Donald Trump. Big stuff. Deep State. Give this information NOW! @FoxNews\nI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\nSo General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday \u201cinterrogation\u201d with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?\nMany people in our Country are asking what the \u201cJustice\u201d Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and \u201cacid washed\u201d 33,000 Emails? No justice!\nCongratulations to @ABC News for suspending Brian Ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the Russia, Russia, Russia Witch Hunt. More Networks and \u201cpapers\u201d should do the same with their Fake News!\nI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\nTainted (no, very dishonest?) FBI \u201cagent's role in Clinton probe under review.\u201d Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.\nAfter years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.\nReport: \u201cANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT LED CLINTON EMAIL PROBE\u201d Now it all starts to make sense!\nA must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!\nHow can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\nWow, \u201cFBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,\u201d according to @FoxNews.\n.@FoxNews-FBI's Andrew McCabe, \u201cin addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.\u201d\nWOW, @foxandfrlends \u201cDossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.\u201d And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!\nCrooked Hillary Clinton's top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others\nWell, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!\nNow that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....\nThe fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!\nThe single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!\nDisproven and paid for by Democrats \u201cDossier used to spy on Trump Campaign. Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election?\u201d @foxandfriends Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!\n\u201cHouse votes on controversial FISA ACT today.\u201d This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\nIn one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!\nWhere are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok? Blaming Samsung!\nGreat jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!\n\u201cThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....\n...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn't straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.\u201d Wall Street Journal\nLittle Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!\nNEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!\nThe Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!\nPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?\n\u201cMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he's been victimized. He's been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......\n....agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don't believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).\u201d Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews\nRussia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\n\u201cCharges Deal Don A Big Win,\u201d written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that \u201cthe Russians had no impact on the election results.\u201d There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. \u201cShe lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. Case closed.\u201d\nDeputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: \u201cThere is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.\nFunny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know!\nVery sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!\nGeneral McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\nFinally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!\nI never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said \u201cit may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.\u201d The Russian \u201choax\u201d was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!\nNow that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn't I a great candidate?\nIf it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!\nThank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc. Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo\nObama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling?\nThank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!\n....The President Obama quote just before election. That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to \u201crock the boat.\u201d When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.\nI have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!\nBad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!\nQuestion: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!\nDem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!\n\u201cRussians had no compromising information on Donald Trump\u201d @FoxNews Of course not, because there is none, and never was. This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace...and Obama did nothing about Russia!\n\u201cCongressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts\u201d @FoxNews So, what else is new. He is a total phony!\n\u201cHe's got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton's criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated. I fully agree with the President on that.\u201d @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show\n\u201cI've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year. I just don't see the evidence....in terms of the collusion, it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have.\u201d Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\n\u201cWe've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don't see it.\u201d Judge Ken Starr\nWITCH HUNT!\nWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\nWhy did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling.\nThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....\n...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.\nTHE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.\nAs the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp\nThe Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!\nWow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked \u201chave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?\u201d He said strongly \u201cnever, no.\u201d He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.\nSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\nWhy does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\nA total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!\n...there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice!\u201d So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.\nI called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......\n\u201cSpecial Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council. I am still opposed to it. I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because.....\nHouse Intelligence Committee votes to release final report. FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia. (2) The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient. (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.\nMany lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted. Problem is that a new......\n....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!\nSo sad that the Department of \u201cJustice\u201d and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress. An embarrassment to our country!\nLawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more. Slow walking - what is going on? BAD!\nWhat does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good!\n\u201cThe FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....\u201d and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld\nAttorney\u201d\u201cclient privilege is dead!\nA TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!\nThe Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story!\nMuch of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!\nIf I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!\nJames Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....\n....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst \u201cbotch jobs\u201d of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!\nDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!\nUnbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!\nThe big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more?\nComey throws AG Lynch \u201cunder the bus!\u201d Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!\nI never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His \u201cmemos\u201d are self serving and FAKE!\nAttorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!\nSlippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!\nComey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!\nSlippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!\nJames Comey just threw Andrew McCabe \u201cunder the bus.\u201d Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?\nJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?\nSo General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don't think so!\nJust heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.\nJames Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?\nThe New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will \u201cflip.\u201d They use....\n....it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don't see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!\nSo funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails!\nJames Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others?\nThe Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as \u201cMr. Magoo\u201d and Rod Rosenstein as \u201cMr. Peepers.\u201d This is \u201caccording to people with whom the president has spoken.\u201d There are no such people and don't know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!\n\u201cAt least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.\u201d Wall Street Journal\n\u201cGOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.\u201d @FoxNews Good luck with that request!\nA complete Witch Hunt!\nKim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, \u201cyou got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There's no there there.\u201d Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!\nJust Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released. \u201cNo evidence\u201d that the Trump Campaign \u201ccolluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.\u201d Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow! A total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!\nHouse Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!\n\u201cClapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN\u201d @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.\nSo disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were \u201cleaked\u201d to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!\nIt would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!\nThere was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!\n\u201cThe questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2 powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone...\u201d Joe Digenova, former US Attorney\nNEW BOOK - A MUST READ! \u201cThe Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\u201d by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!\nA Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal \u201cjustice?\u201d At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!\nThe Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, it's called Fighting Back\nThe 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait \u201d\u02dctill the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!\nLisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!\nIs this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!\nSenator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn't really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!\nCan you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it!\nCongratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!\nWow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI \u201cSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.\u201d Andrew McCarthy says, \u201cThere's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.\u201d If so, this is bigger than Watergate!\nDespite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and \u201cHaters,\u201d but that's the way it is!\n\u201cApparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit.\u201d David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff!\nWhy isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!\nReports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a \u201chot\u201d Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!\nIf the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!\nThings are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World's most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!\n....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption...\n...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.\nNow that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!\nWhat ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?\n....and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?\nThe Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they're looking at the rest of the World. Oh' great!\nI hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!\n\u201cJohn Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....\n....top of the FBI. Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump. We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which....\n...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself, he's worried about staying out of Jail.\u201d Dan Bongino\nThe Wall Street Journal asks, \u201cWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?\u201d A very good question!\n...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!\nIf the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...\n@foxandfriends \u201cNew Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?\u201d Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!\nLook how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!\n\u201cIt's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano\nSPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!\n\u201cTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign\u201d No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!\nWITCH HUNT!\nClapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!\nNot surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE\nThe Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an \u201cInformant\u201d who is paid a fortune and who \u201csets up\u201d way earlier than the Russian Hoax?\nCan anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!\n\u201cEveryone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.\u201d Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!\nWith Spies, or \u201cInformants\u201d as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or \u201cJustice\u201d contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?\nThis whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!\nWhen will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It's been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia?\nWho's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington, D.C., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!\nWhy didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation!\nWhy didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.\n\u201cThe President deserves some answers.\u201d @FoxNews in discussing \u201cSPYGATE.\u201d\n\u201cSally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept. I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable.\u201d Jonathan Turley\n\u201cWe now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation. That raises legitimate questions. I just find this really odd...this goes to the heart of our electoral system.\u201d Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\n\u201cThis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and scandalous.\u201d Mollie Hemingway\nThe 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!\nWhy aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!\nSorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.\nThe Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, I'm President!\nRep.Trey Gowdy, \u201cI don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's....\n....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, \u201d\u02dcoh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and that's how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you.....\n....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else!\u201d And I wish I did!\nThe soon to be released book, \u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump,\u201d written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see! Out in 5 weeks.\n\u201cThe recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States.\u201d JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.\nRUSH LIMBAUGH \u201cIf the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren't targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.\u201d\nIger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!\nThe corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?\nNot that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!\nA.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!\n\u201cJohn Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar, he's a liar about being a liar.\u201d Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends\n....\u201c$17 million spent, it's a scam Investigation. Americans are being worked. We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats. The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $'s to Crooked H).\u201d Dan Bongino\nThere was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?\nJesse Watters \u201cThe only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.\u201d So true!\nAs only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of \u201cJustice\u201d have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me!\n....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired!\nMark Penn \u201cWhy are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost.\u201d A disgrace!\nAs has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!\nThe appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong!\nThe Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.\nWhat is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!\nThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself...I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!\nWow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!\nGreat interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?\nChris Farrell, Judicial Watch. \u201cThey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...\n...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff\n....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!\nAlan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: \u201cIt all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back. Not the way Justice should operate.\u201d So true!\nWhen and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?\nOur Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a \u201cplea deal\u201d to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!\nWhen will people start saying, \u201cthank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?\u201d\nThe Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this \u201cmatter\u201d (as Comey would call it). Investigate!\nNow that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.\nSo, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!\nFBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that \u201cwe'll stop\u201d candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesn't get any lower than that!\nThe IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!\n\u201cWhy in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey)?\u201d asks Mark Levin!\n\u201cDonald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey.\u201d Mark Levin\nWow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns. Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob. What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others? Very unfair!\nI've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report...and never forget the Fake News Media. It never ends!\nThe IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!\nDaniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: \u201cThis IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein's memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey. So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.\u201d Witch Hunt!\nWITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!\nWhy was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn't matter to them!\nWhy was the FBI's sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe'll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!\n\u201cThe highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.\u201d Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn't it?\nComey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey's best friend. Witch Hunt!\nI can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!\u201d Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p\n\u201cFBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.\u201d @FoxNews Big News, but the Fake News doesn't want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!\nOur great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, \u201cLiars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy,\u201d which is fantastic. Go get it!\n.@FoxNews Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!\nThe Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!\nFormer Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!\nI have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents?\nWhy is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isn't this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?\nThe hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!\n\u201cThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?\u201d Judge Andrew Napolitano\nLover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!\nRussia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions, so much corruption!\nPeter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!\nWhen is Bob Mueller going to list his Conflicts of Interest? Why has it taken so long? Will they be listed at the top of his $22,000,000 Report...And what about the 13 Angry Democrats, will they list their conflicts with Crooked H? How many people will be sent to jail and......\n....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...And what is going on in the FBI & DOJ with Crooked Hillary, the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!\nJust won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others), colluded with Russia. They haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!\nPublic opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the \u201cSpecial\u201d Counsel because the public understands that there was no Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!\nThe Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more. It's a Democrat Con Job!\nEx-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised! Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!\nHow can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!\nAs I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews\n....Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?\nThe stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?\nThese Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didn't Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why. Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual!\nHeading to Helsinki, Finland \u2013 looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow. Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia...\nPresident Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!\nOur relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!\nThe meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media!\nWhile I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!\nThank you @RandPaul. \u201cThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed to think?\u201d\nSo many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!\nSome people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome!\nThe Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!\n\u201cTrump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.\u201d Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips. The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don't want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set.\nI got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!\nInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!\nThe Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the \u201d\u02dc16 Election never ends!\nNo Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!\nCongratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of \u201cJustice\u201d and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!\nLooking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!\nAndrew McCarthy - \u201cI said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.\u201d On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!\nI had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!\n.@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews \u201cSource #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes, the Dirty Dossier, paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump, and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...\u201d ILLEGAL!\nSo President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn't he do something about it? Why didn't he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that's why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!\nSo we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!\nWhen you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!\n\u201cIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....\n....and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....\n.....\u201dCarter Page wasn't a spy, wasn't an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.\u201d Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America. They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now!\n\u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump\u201d is a Hot Seller, already Number One! More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!\nWhat kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!\n.@AlanDersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn't vote for me, has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way. He has written a new and very important book...\n...called \u201cThe Case Against Impeaching Trump,\u201d which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read!\n....,the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO,....\n.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\nThere is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\nIs Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..\n....Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama....And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?\nCollusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!\n\u201cFBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one. He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP. He needed an insurance policy. Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election. He should never, ever been allowed to........\n.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It won't go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.\u201d ALAN DERSHOWITZ....\n..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!\nPaul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!\nRussian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!\nLooking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and \u201cPublic Enemy Number One,\u201d or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?\n\u201cWe already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?\u201d Marc Thiessen, Washington Post\nCongratulations to @GreggJarrett on The TREMENDOUS success of his just out book, \u201cThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump.\u201d Already number one on Amazon. Hard work from a brilliant guy. It's the Real Story of the Rigged Witch Hunt!\nCongratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book, \u201cTHE RUSSIA HOAX, THE ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD TRUMP,\u201d going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon. It is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. Great book!\nFake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!\n...Why aren't Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!\nToo bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS!\n\u201cCollusion with Russia was very real. Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians, and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT. We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through....\n....a law firm, eventually Kremlin connected sources, to gather info on Donald Trump. Collusion is very real with Russia, but only with Hillary and the Democrats, and we should demand a full investigation.\u201d Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends Looking forward to the new IG Report!\n\u201cThere has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite, that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election.\u201d @GrahamLedger\nThis is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted. It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. Phony Dossier, FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired. 17 Angry Dems? Stay tuned!\n@LindseyGrahamSC \u201cWhy didn't the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page? Is there a double standard here?\u201d They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump. Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY?\nJenna Ellis \u201cFBI thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win. There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop.\u201d\n.@MariaBartiromo \u201cNo evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians - and here we are, a year and a half later.\u201d\nWhy isn't the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won't give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.....\n.....Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers!\nThe big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC....\n.@JudgeJeanine \u201cBob Mueller, isn't your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier, paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump, & used to con a FISA Court Judge. Bob, I really think it's time for you to give up your phony investigation.\u201d No Collusion!\n\u201cSeems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President\u201d. @DarrellIssa @foxandfriends If this had happened to the other side, everybody involved would be in jail. This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time.\nAgent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!\nJust fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!\nTom Fitton of Judicial Watch: \u201cThe Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else. There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok & his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI. We know this...\n....guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus. Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation. Instead, Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong. He used Strzok, he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing....\n....should be shut down. The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt. It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.\u201d Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn't have said it better myself!\nBruce Ohr of the \u201cJustice\u201d Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele \u201cfind dirt on Trump.\u201d Ohr's wife, Nelly, was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier. @foxandfriends\n\u201cThey were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn't do.\u201d Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started! Looking at the wrong people.\nFired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started. There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it. The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC!\nStrzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn't this so-called \u201cprobe\u201d ended immediately? Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?\nLou Dobbs: \u201cThis cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.\u201d Thank you Lou, so true!\nThe Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the \u201coriginators and founders\u201d of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!\n\u201cThe action (the Strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey's skinny inner circle.\u201d Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director.\n\u201cJohn Brennan is a stain on the Country, we deserve better than this.\u201d Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book, \u201cSpygate, the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan, and good luck with the book!\n\u201cHillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI. We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump\u201d concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt. JOE DIGENOVA, former U.S. Attorney.\nMark Levin \u201cWhen they had power they didn't stop the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, they funded the Iranians & are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election & trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.\u201d\n\u201cI'd strip the whole bunch of them. They're all corrupt. They've all abused their power. They've all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States.\u201d @seanhannity\n\u201cThe FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department & whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).\u201d Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok. This is too crazy to be believed! The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility.\n\u201cWhile Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.\u201d Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words, they were colluding with Russia!\n\u201cVery concerned about Comey's firing, afraid they will be exposed,\u201d said Bruce Ohr. DOJ's Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr's connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier. A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act. Rigged Witch Hunt!\n.@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: \u201cHow did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?\u201d Now that is a really good question! Then followed by \u201cRichard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...\u201d So true, a total Fake!\nHow can \u201cSenator\u201d Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone? Loser!\n\u201c....An incredibly corrupt FBI & DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election. Brennan has gone off the deep end, he's disgraced and discredited himself. His conduct has been outrageous.\u201d Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch.\n\u201cDirector Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power. If Director Brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA, why didn't he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment......\n.....released in 2017. If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach......\u201d Richard Burr (R-NC) Senate Intel Cmte Chair @LouDobbs\n\u201cFox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.\u201d Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED!\n\u201cBruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it's astonishing that he's still employed. Bruce & Nelly Ohr's bank account is getting fatter & fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling. He doesn't disclose it under Fed Regs. Using your Federal office for personal.......\n....financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation, Bribery Statute Violation, Honest Services Violation....all Major Crimes....because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions......\u201d Gregg Jarrett. So when does Mueller do what must be done? Probably never! @FoxNews\nAll of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China. But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone!\nHas anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director? He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country!", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Invest in advanced energy technologies and create \"millions of new, good 'Green Collar' American jobs.\"\nEnforce pay-as-you-go budgeting rules.

One-year pause in non-defense, non-veterans discretionary spending. Call for presidential line-item veto. \"New authorizations should be offset by reducing another program, and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization.\"\nAll Americans should have coverage they can afford. Families and individuals should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans, including many private health insurance options and a public plan. Coverage should be made affordable for all Americans with subsidies provided through tax credits and other means. Insurance should be portable from job to job.\nStrengthen Medicare by cutting costs and protecting seniors from fraud. Fix Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program: \"Repeal the prohibition on negotiating prescription drug prices, ban drug companies from paying generic producers to refrain from entering drug markets, and eliminate drug company interference with generic competition.\" Phase-out the cap on Medicaid funding and phase-in equal participation in other federal health care assistance programs.

So He Sued an Energy Company in Germany.\nClimate Chaos Is Coming \u2014 and the Pinkertons Are Ready\nAs they see it, global warming stands to make corporate security as high-stakes in the 21st century as it was in the 19th.\nThe Pinkertons wanted me to picture myself in a scene of absolute devastation. \u201cA hurricane just wipes out everything, and you need to feed your children,\u201d Andres Paz Larach said. The power grid is down, shipments of food are cut off, the water is no longer potable \u2014 how do you get what you need to survive? What risks do you take? It was a hot early morning in March, and we were driving through a pine forest high in the mountains surrounding Santa Ana Jilotzingo, 25 miles northwest of Mexico City. Our Suburban, equipped with bulletproof windows and reinforced doors, labored slowly over the dirt road, which appeared to have been washed out by a recent thunderstorm.\nFor much of the previous hour, Paz Larach and two other executives from Pinkerton, Carlos Manuel L\u00f3pez Portillo Maltos and Paul Rakov, had been explaining the company\u2019s philosophy of risk management. Now over 150 years old, having long outlived its reputation as Andrew Carnegie\u2019s personal militia, the agency has evolved into a modern security firm. Over the last decade or so, Pinkerton began noticing a growing set of anxieties among its corporate clients about distinctly contemporary plagues \u2014 active shooters, political unrest, climate disasters \u2014 and in response began offering data-driven risk analysis, in addition to what they\u2019re more traditionally known for. Dressed in an untucked powder blue oxford and round, rimless sunglasses, Paz Larach, the firm\u2019s senior vice president in charge of the Americas, paused before affecting a look of brutal candor. \u201cYou\u2019re going to turn to desperate measures,\u201d he said. Everybody will. The other Pinkertons nodded.\nI was seated in the rear row next to Rakov, a marketing officer who, at 51, had recently shifted his career from more traditional P.R. to Pinkerton. He was now fully fluent in the language of tactical response. He chimed in to observe that preparing for a disaster can carry its own risks. He gave the example of a drought. \u201cIf a client has food and water and all the other stuff,\u201d he said, \u201cthen they become a target.\u201d L\u00f3pez Portillo and Paz Larach uttered small words of consensus in Spanish, while scanning through email on their phones. \u201cAnd if and when desperate people discovered that cache of water and food,\u201d he continued, it was the Pinkertons\u2019 job to protect it at whatever cost.\n[Read about how Wall Street is hedging against the apocalypse.]\nOur destination that morning was a shooting range called Club de Tiro Jarib\u00fa, which Pinkerton sometimes uses for agent and client trainings. The idea had been to demonstrate what Pinkerton agents go through before they are deployed to disaster zones. L\u00f3pez Portillo had also lately fielded several inquiries from corporate clients, asking for lessons in tactical skills like evasive driving and extraction from disaster zones, both for themselves and sometimes hundreds or more of their employees. \u201cSomeone who works in corporate \u2014 say, as an attorney or salesperson,\u201d he said, \u201cthey find it something completely new and useful.\u201d\nAt the range, which was made up of seven terraced target areas bulldozed into a steep ridge, we were greeted by our instructor, Reynold Castro R\u00f3man. A former Mexican military officer, he wore black fatigues with the Pinkerton all-seeing-eye logo emblazoned on either shoulder. A kaffiyeh hid a long scar along his neck. During an intel mission 16 years ago, Castro R\u00f3man was flying over marijuana fields when the plane went down \u2014 from what Castro R\u00f3man suspected was narco fire \u2014 killing the three others on board. Since then, he has dedicated himself almost exclusively to private-sector urban-combat training, often for Pinkerton.\nOver the next three hours, Castro R\u00f3man worked us steadily through various readiness drills, including quick-draw methods, accuracy competitions and timed reloading under pressure. We shot nine-millimeter pistols and Israeli assault rifles. Considering all the firearms, the atmosphere was relaxed and sporting. Nearby, a man grilled chorizo and carne asada. A cooler and makeshift bar was stocked with beer, wine and mezcal.\nThe scene was a stark contrast to the big-data wonkery I was pitched in the car ride over. But Paz Larach explained that their statistical and tactical approaches were fundamentally connected. All businesses exposed themselves to risk, which had to be mitigated, insured or, more relevantly, defended against. Even if the Pinkertons couldn\u2019t predict the specific risks of the future, they had a general sense of what it might look like \u2014 and what opportunities they might avail themselves of as it materialized. According to the World Bank, by 2050 some 140 million people may be displaced by sea-level rise and extreme weather, driving escalations in crime, political unrest and resource conflict. Even if the most conservative predictions about our climate future prove overstated, a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in temperature during the next century will almost certainly provoke chaos, in what experts call climate change\u2019s \u201cthreat multiplier\u201d: Displacement begets desperation begets disorder. Reading these projections from the relative comforts of the C-suite, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see why a company might consider enhancing its security protocols.\nFor Pinkerton, the bet is twofold: first, that there\u2019s no real material difference between climate change and any other conflict \u2014 as the world grows more predictably dangerous, tactical know-how will simply be more in demand than ever. And second, that by adding data analytics, Pinkerton stands to compete more directly with traditional consulting firms like Deloitte, which offer pre- and postdisaster services (supply-chain monitoring, damage documentation, etc.), but which cannot, say, dispatch a helicopter full of armed guards to Guatemala in an afternoon. In theory, Pinkerton can do both \u2014 a fully militarized managerial class at corporate disposal.\nLater, after Paz Larach took his turn on the range \u2014 during which he emptied a Galil ACE assault rifle into a human-shaped cardboard cutout, then quickly drew his nine-millimeter, grouping four shots in the chest-cavity bull\u2019s-eye \u2014 he offered the example of Hurricane Maria. On the day the Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Puerto Rico in 2017, he received more than 30 calls from American businesses and multinationals. He wouldn\u2019t go into detail but explained that many chief executives felt blind to the situation and effectively tendered a blank check if Pinkerton could provide security. Over the next few days, as the company deployed hundreds of agents to the island, some of them, Paz Larach claimed, reported seeing firearms brandished at gas stations. \u201cWe had to escort the cargo with real agents, have cars chase the main truck,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who did not have protection were having their cargo hijacked.\u201d\nAware that he might end up sounding vampiric, Paz Larach hesitated, then eventually confessed what he\u2019d wanted to say in the first place: The future looked pretty good for Pinkerton.\nYou could be forgiven for assuming that the Pinkertons were relics of the past. Like the stage coaches the company once protected, the name Pinkerton summons up sepia-tinted images of the American West \u2014 black-hatted detectives pursuing train robbers, or rooting out labor agitators from coal mines. And indeed, Allan Pinkerton organized his agency in response to the lawlessness of the frontier. When he first began offering his services in the early 1850s, a majority of the territories west of the Mississippi remained ungoverned; few towns offered policing, and fewer still had the means to investigate crimes after the fact. Overnight, Pinkerton\u2019s novel methods of \u201ccrime detection,\u201d which included infiltrating gangs and developing networks of informants, became the standards of investigation, and his company became a sort of de facto national police force. According to some historians, by the late 19th century, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency numbered more men than the United States Army.\nIn the intervening years, the Pinkertons have survived in no small part because of their ability to adapt to the changing landscapes of crime. To differentiate his agency from common bounty hunters, Pinkerton worked to professionalize his ranks with formal attire, pay and badges and created what probably was the first national criminal database. In the following years, as railroads opened up the frontier and settlement brought with it the rule of law, Pinkerton turned to what he saw as the \u201criotous element\u201d growing in company towns. Between 1877 and 1892, Pinkertons were dispatched to break up some 70 labor strikes \u2014 either by going undercover to provide intel, or through brute force.\n[Read David Leonhardt on the economics of climate change.]\nIt was only after a particularly lethal clash during a strike in Homestead, Pa., in 1892 that the public began to wonder if the threat of the Pinkertons eclipsed those they supposedly protected against. In the years since the frontier closed, antitrust sentiment had grown, and demand for the Pinkertons lessened \u2014 in part because the government was more able to enforce its laws. In the aftermath of Homestead, Congress and 23 states passed \u201canti-Pinkerton\u201d acts, banning government bodies from hiring mercenaries as strikebreakers.\nIn the decades since, the Pinkertons have undertaken several rebrandings, each aimed at lowering their public profile, though through it all they never gave up the lucrative specter of their name: the Pinkerton Agency, Pinkerton\u2019s Inc., Pinkerton. During the first half of the 20th century, the company protected wartime factories and later began to seek out new markets in parts of the world, like India and China, where authority could still be outsourced. In 1999, the Swedish security giant Securitas AB absorbed the agency, buying it for a reported $384 million, and the company underwent rebranding once again, this time as a boutique risk-management firm. It began diversifying into intellectual-property services and cybersecurity. Among their most popular new services is the Pinkerton Dedicated Professional, in which agents join a client\u2019s company like any other new hire, allowing them to provide intel on employees. By 2018, the agency said it could count among its clients about 80 percent of Fortune 1,000 companies.\nThe best outcome for these new data-driven Pinkertons is that this century lapses into the kind of lawlessness and disorder that makes it look more like the 19th \u2014 which many scientists and economists think it could. Since 1980, a period that includes all 20 of the warmest years in recorded history and 18 of the 20 most intense hurricane seasons in the satellite era, losses in the United States from storms, wildfires and droughts topped $1.6 trillion \u2014 nearly a third of which occurred in just the last five years. And this exponential destruction is just the beginning of what David Wallace-Wells, in his book \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth,\u201d calls the Great Dying: a worldwide economic decline, sharply deteriorated living conditions, disruption to basic government functions and widespread hunger. Looking deeper still into the future, the predictions are even more dire. Over the next century, 3.7 degrees of warming could contribute to an additional 22,000 murders and 1.3 million burglaries in the United States.\nWhatever the exact costs of climate change, it is Pinkerton\u2019s job to read between the numbers looking for the potential for violence. If you\u2019re suffering only one hurricane every 20 years or so, shelling out $1 million to Pinkerton isn\u2019t such a big deal, Paz Larach explained; you bake it into your risk. \u201cBut if there\u2019s a disaster every year, which is happening more and more, it makes more sense to have dedicated staff on standby.\u201d A Pinkerton on standby doesn\u2019t mean protection for just your insurable risks but also for the uninsurable risks \u2014 business interruptions, theft of trade secrets, pandemics. And with the environment increasingly weaponized against the poor, to borrow Wallace-Wells\u2019s phrase, the sectors that rely on cheap labor will face more unrest among workers; the state will struggle to keep up with crime; and in the aftermath of storms, with landslides blocking first responders, regional offices will be cut off.\nAnd this, of course, is exactly the sort of environment in which the Pinkertons thrive.\nThe morning after weapons training, I found myself once again in the back of an armored Suburban. Paz Larach was talking on the phone beside me as we made our way to the Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez, a racetrack where we were scheduled to learn evasive driving. Throughout my visit, the Pinkertons had insisted on providing me a full security detail, which included the armored car and two escorting agents, as a way of simulating executive protection. The two agents were clad in black suits and earpieces and shadowed me to dinner, interviews and an outing to the Templo Mayor Museum; rarely during the three days could I get either to chat with me. They treated the job, however farcical it seemed, gravely.\nLike people, companies could become habituated to modernity\u2019s relative safety, Paz Larach said. But it was his job to shock them out of such thinking, whether through exercises or data. For much of the last century, the traditional form of defense for businesses has been insurance compensation \u2014 pay a premium up front, recover later. But one of the many byproducts of this model of subsidized recovery, according to economists, has been unfettered growth along floodplains, hurricane-impact zones and other high-risk areas. After Hurricane Harvey, Pinkerton found clients were frustrated and open to alternatives. \u201cMost clients were not prepared enough,\u201d Paz Larach said. \u201cAn insurance policy is just a piece of paper.\u201d\n[Read about new legal strategies to make the world\u2019s biggest polluters pay for climate change.]\nPaz Larach rattled off a suite of services that were not, strictly speaking, covered by that piece of paper: armed warehouse defense, executive extraction, 24-hour surveillance, chartered helicopters and planes, escorted cargo shipments. \u201cIf you abandon your property, you\u2019re kind of just blindfolding yourself,\u201d he said \u2014 checking news, hoping for the best. \u201cWe\u2019re your eyes and ears on the ground.\u201d During the 2017 hurricane season, the Pinkertons chartered half a dozen planes across the Caribbean, each of them full of food and under armed escort, to the tune of around $100,000 each. Ordinarily, Pinkerton bills on a relatively cheap hourly basis, but during a state of emergency, the rate soars, something Paz Larach compared to Uber\u2019s surge pricing. By the end of the season, after Maria, Harvey and Irma, Paz Larach told me the company billed tens of millions of dollars.\nHowever bankable and flashy, tactical work is by its nature highly reactive, which has left Pinkerton vulnerable to steep fluctuations in revenue. At the same time, Paz Larach found himself increasingly frustrated by how few businesses took even the simplest of precautions \u2014 generators, stores of water, cameras to prove damage to adjusters. But as he brought these ideas to businesses, he discovered an unexpected drawback to the Pinkerton name: Companies didn\u2019t tend to call for advice; they called because they needed \u201ca guy for a job,\u201d as Paz Larach put it. So over the last five years, as the company watched the demand for incident response skyrocket, it began to pour resources into building three data-and-information-gathering centers: one each in Seattle and The Hague, which focus mainly on crunching big data to predict crime trends worldwide, and a \u201cGlobal Intelligence Center\u201d in Mexico City, which is geared more toward the operational response to those trends.\nThe Mexico City Global Intelligence Center occupies a large wing on the fourth floor of an angular glass building in the neighborhood of Jardines del Pedregal. At the entrance, through double glass doors, I was greeted by an enormous black rendering of the Pinkerton logo and slogan \u2014 \u201cWe never sleep\u201d \u2014 along with framed prints of documents and photographs from the agency\u2019s early days, among them one of Allan Pinkerton standing with President Lincoln, another the rap sheet for Butch Cassidy. The center of the space was dominated by a long white desk, at which several employees, all in black Pinkerton jackets, sat at computers. Behind a biometric scanner lay the operational nerve center of the office, which appeared surprisingly empty. From our conversations, I\u2019d expected a hive of analysts hunched over intricate software displays. But nearly every surface was eerily immaculate, free of any visible sign of stress; at their computers, a handful of analysts browsed Associated Press stories and pecked numbers into Excel. CNN was on. The whole office felt somehow incomplete, as if the company had staged the place in haste.\nPaz Larach and I were met there by David Valenzuela, a former Mexican police officer who looked to still be adjusting to corporate life: He sported a deep blue fatigue shirt, which he\u2019d tucked into his slacks. Valenzuela was in charge of overseeing the analysts who worked there. After scanning into the nerve center, he stood by a screen on the wall, which flashed up a GPS readout of our location. Several separate, smaller frames within the larger one then displayed ticking feeds: Twitter, a news wire, Doppler radar, quick links to police and fire. This was the Pinkerton \u201cthreat monitor\u201d \u2014 quite literally, a monitor.\nMany of the Pinkertons\u2019 tools, including the threat monitor, were originally developed only for internal use \u2014 for an agent tracking a C.E.O. through disputed cartel territory, or keeping an eye on a tanker in waters known for piracy. But over the last few hurricane and wildfire seasons, when storms and blazes began to overtake industrial corridors throughout the Eastern Seaboard and California, the company found that C.E.O.s wanted access to these tools. To sweeten the deal, Pinkerton built out packaged services, including storehouses of food, a threat dashboard for C-suite computers and daily intelligence briefings. Excited by the implications, the company began rolling out an entire conceptual framework around what it called \u201capplied risk science.\u201d\nListening to Paz Larach pitch the agency\u2019s future \u2014 all of it rendered in the gauzy language of consulting \u2014 I was struck by its relative simplicity, which belied, in part, just how far most companies and governments are from accepting the reality of climate change. Even if Pinkerton\u2019s core competency still lies in tactical response, the means of preparation are not exactly the province of big data: Put food in a warehouse, aggregate news, consult the latest open-source modeling. Pinkerton doesn\u2019t even see this strategy as climate-related, per se. The company doesn\u2019t have a dedicated climate division, nor climate experts; from its perspective, that would be redundant. Pinkerton sells safety, or its pretense, in the face of catastrophe, and the only real differences between the catastrophes of this century and the 19th, on some level, will be rate and severity. As Jack Zahran, the president of Pinkerton, put it to me, Pinkerton is a 150-year-old start-up, still pitching the same basic vision: You aren\u2019t prepared enough, and the government is too clumsy to save you.\nLater, at the racetrack, we watched three young men suit up in ski masks to shoot paintballs at our S.U.V. Even among my Pinkerton handlers, the theater of exercise seemed to strain the reasonable connections between tactical response and climate change. Throughout my visit, I wondered whether I had caught Pinkerton in the midst of an awkward organizational transition, or if the company stood merely to capitalize on the world\u2019s growing panic \u2014 and if the difference really mattered. They had, after all, taken me to fire automatic weapons, ostensibly as a training exercise against desperate, disaster-ravaged people. It was impossible to experience that and not project it into a future in which, in the absence of true climate policy or mitigation, capital felt free to protect itself from outside risks \u2014 whatever form they may take.\nDuring one of the long meals that Paz Larach, Rakov, L\u00f3pez Portillo and I shared, the novelty of my being there had faded just enough for them to reflect personally on climate change. The relentless pragmatism of trying to respond to disasters and analyze their occurrence had seemed to leave the men with little space for the existential dread that marks so much of the modern condition. But for whatever reason, on this night, as we picked at a plate of escamoles \u2014 a central-Mexican delicacy of ant larvae \u2014 they spoke about their anxieties.\nL\u00f3pez Portillo, who until then had been jovial if diplomatic in answering my questions, turned solemn, his eyes glancing around the vaulted ceiling. He said he worried about his children, and what sort of world he might be leaving them. But his fear, he clarified, wasn\u2019t exactly that they wouldn\u2019t learn to adapt; it was that he, their father, didn\u2019t know what adaptation would look like. He said that he feared variables he didn\u2019t know how to calculate, variables he couldn\u2019t conceive of yet.\nWhen L\u00f3pez Portillo finished, Paz Larach admitted that thinking that far out was still difficult for him. He was 33 and just married. What the most immediate future held for him was a new home in Miami, where he and his wife had just bought an apartment on the water. It had always been their dream. When I asked him about sea-level rise \u2014 something with which Miami is practically synonymous \u2014 he paused for a moment, then said, \u201cWe know it\u2019s a risk, but we looked at it and decided it was worth it.\u201d And anyway, the apartment wouldn\u2019t be ready until 2021. They\u2019d deal with it then.\nNoah Gallagher Shannon is a writer from northern Colorado who now lives in New York.

It\u2019s more like a gut feeling, and it depends on how you feel about your own privacy, how much you value strangers\u2019 privacy and the trust you have in corporations and law enforcement.\nBut the results also emphasize a quirk in our digital behavior: People rarely change what they do online, even when they express serious concerns about how their data is used. This is sometimes called the privacy paradox.\n\u201cOne of the reasons people say one thing and do another is they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Lee Rainie, the director of internet and technology research at the Pew Research Center. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re being hypocritical, or that they\u2019re mouthing one thing and immediately dismissing it in another moment. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t actually know.\u201d\nResearchers studying the paradox say internet companies make it hard for users to judge their privacy risks. Users might feel like they have no choice but to use services like email or social networks. The sites might also make it hard to learn about all of their data practices. Facebook, for example, has a lengthy Data Policy, but it\u2019s written so broadly that it's nearly impossible to figure out what exactly they do with your data. Just signing up for a digital service often means consenting to all kinds of data use and collection.\nUnder those conditions, is it surprising people aren\u2019t changing their behavior?\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nTrusting Social Media\nThe paradox is clearest with social media, which has been a focus of privacy concerns for decades. Facebook, for example, has endured a barrage of bad press over the past few years, including the fallout from Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political consulting company harvested information from millions of unsuspecting users to build detailed profiles on voters (a practice it ended in 2015). Even so, Facebook reported late last year that its number of daily active users in the United States and Canada remained steady at 185 million.\nUntil recently, Facebook did a version of many of the practices listed here.\n|Does Facebook do this, or has it?|\n|if you provide it||collects personal information about me|\n|uses friends' posts to send me targeted advertisements|\n|lets companies upload customer lists so they can send me targeted advertising|\n|until April 2018||buys information about me from third parties|\n|on some sites||receives details about my activity from other websites|\n|at some retailers||receives information on what I buy in physical stores|\n|after granting permission||lets third parties download basic information on my friends without their consent|\n|until April 2015 (after granting permission)||lets third parties download information on my friends, like their relationship status and interests, without their consent|\n|it was tested in 2016||serves me targeted ads on a smart TV app that has a relationship with the website|\n|if you enable location services||might know when I walk into into a physical store using the location I share with the phone app|\nSo far, percent of our readers were comfortable with sites collecting personal data. But that doesn\u2019t mean those basic practices come without risk. Agreeing to those basic kinds of data collection enrolls users in Facebook's entire data ecosystem.\nArtificial intelligence \u201ccan make all of these things far worse,\u201d added Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author on a 2018 study about modern surveillance. He said running machine learning \u2014 a branch of artificial intelligence \u2014 on basic information collected by social networks can allow them to \u201cinfer things that I couldn\u2019t even imagine a company could learn.\u201d\nNew Privacy Frontier: DNA\n|Is this already happening?|\n|uses my DNA to offer clues about my genealogy|\n|uses my DNA to determine specific health risks like cancer|\n|uses data from surveys I complete on the site to build a richer profile about me|\n|if you opt in||invites me to participate in pharmaceutical research if my DNA profile matches research needs|\n|if you opt in||sells an analysis of my anonymous/aggregated DNA profile to third parties|\n|if you opt in||uses my DNA profile to conduct research on behalf of pharma companies|\n|if you opt in||sells my anonymous DNA profile to third parties as part of paid research projects|\n|if you opt in||lets customers identify relatives by matching DNA to other customers|\n|lets law enforcement agencies register as users, which lets them look for criminals by matching DNA profiles (without a warrant)|\nGenetic companies like 23andMe and Ancestry analyze customer DNA to provide clues about genealogy and health risks. But the data also offers another potential revenue stream: repackaging it as valuable data for pharmaceutical companies, colleges and researchers.\nBoth 23andMe and Ancestry allow customers to opt into research collaborations with third parties \u2014 relationships the companies say will lead to scientific breakthroughs.\nAncestry said it has no current for-profit ventures and only one nonprofit collaboration with the University of Utah. But in 2015, it partnered with the biotech research company Calico to analyze anonymized data from its trove of genetic samples and, possibly, commercialize their findings.\nThe deal ended last year, and its financial terms were never released.\n23andMe said it\u2019s currently partnering with pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and recently collaborated with Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharma giant Roche. Past collaborations also include Grunenthal, Celmatix, Lundbeck and Milken Institute, and two with Pfizer.\nThe company said the vast majority of their partnerships use de-identified and aggregated data (so it\u2019s pooled with other genetic profiles and summarized, removing identifying information). Other collaborations involved sharing parts of your DNA profile, stripped of additional identifying information like your name. 23andMe emphasized they provide several different opt-ins and consent forms before customers are enrolled. But privacy experts have questioned whether consenting to long documents full of legal terms is the best approach.\n\u201cThe classic notice-and-consent regime that has been the anchor of all kinds of things \u2014 not just online transactions but who\u2019s in medical trials and who is getting what kind of medical treatments \u2013 that regime is a complicated one,\u201d said Mr. Rainie. \u201cEspecially when there are lots of little encounters, lots of little transactions, where a notice-and-consent format might be implicated, people are confused by all of this.\u201d\nIn our poll, percent of readers were comfortable with pharmaceutical companies profiting from their genetic material. Meanwhile, 23andMe said 80 percent of its customers agree to enroll in research during registration, when they see several consent forms in a row. This consent form allows for their de-identified DNA information to be used for research projects, some of them funded by pharmaceutical companies. The company said that the enrollment process was approved by an outside ethics review board.\nContext and Combinations Matter\n|Is this already happening?|\n|in at least some schools||uses facial recognition to match my face against a list of employees in my workplace|\n|planned for a Brooklyn building||checks my face against a database of tenants in my apartment building|\n|tool is being marketed||checks my face against a database of known shoplifters|\n|in a Walgreens pilot||uses facial analysis to determine my age and gender|\n|in a Walgreens pilot||tracks where I look in a store|\n|not in real time||allows police to match my face against a mugshot database|\n|not in real time||allows police to match my faces against a driver's license database|\n|an Israeli company claims to do this||interprets the features on my face to guess other attributes about me|\n|in a pilot project||monitors major roads or bridges 24/7|\n|in the U.K.||lets police departments scan crowds in real time|\n|in New York, according to a news report||watches a subsidized housing project to identify people|\nAll facial recognition practices listed here are happening somewhere in the world today, signalling how A.I. can be combined with video surveillance to create new privacy risks. New York City experimented with using facial recognition on drivers as they crossed bridges and tunnels around Manhattan. And an Israeli startup claims to be able to identify specific attributes like \u201chigh IQ\u201d or \u201cterrorist.\u201d But in most cases, it\u2019s hard to know exactly where and how the burgeoning technology is being used.\n\u201cFor all of these, we know the capability is being advertised, but don't necessarily know if anyone is using the technology for that purpose,\u201d said Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law Center.\nWhile each piece of technology in our poll comes with some privacy risks, the most invasive applications can come when those technologies are used in tandem like this.\nIt\u2019s possible to imagine how combining facial recognition with drones, or connecting it to a citywide network of real-time cameras, could suddenly make the technology far more invasive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the individual collections of online activity that\u2019s the problem,\u201d said Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School and author of \u201cData and Goliath: The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the correlation of offline activity, and location, and income estimates, and so on. It\u2019s not cameras on drones, it\u2019s cameras on drones plus automatic face recognition, plus activity monitoring, plus predictive behavioral algorithms. It\u2019s not any one individual privacy invasion \u2013 it\u2019s all of them used together.\u201d\nStuart A.

Now, investigators are using it to find suspects and witnesses near crimes, running the risk of snaring the innocent.\nWhen detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a murder investigation last December, they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went cold.\nThe police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.\nInvestigators also had other circumstantial evidence, including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic, the same model that Mr. Molina owned, though they could not see the license plate or attacker.\nBut after he spent nearly a week in jail, the case against Mr. Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him. Last month, the police arrested another man: his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who had sometimes used Mr. Molina\u2019s car.\nThe warrants, which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault, turn the business of tracking cellphone users\u2019 locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement. In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies, it is just the latest example of how personal information \u2014 where you go, who your friends are, what you read, eat and watch, and when you do it \u2014 is being used for purposes many people never expected. As privacy concerns have mounted among consumers, policymakers and regulators, tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practices.\nThe Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique, whose use has risen sharply in the past six months, according to Google employees familiar with the requests. It can help solve crimes. But it can also snare innocent people.\nTechnology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users\u2019 information. The new warrants go further, suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues. Often, Google employees said, the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devices.\nLaw enforcement officials described the method as exciting, but cautioned that it was just one tool.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pop out the answer like a ticker tape, saying this guy\u2019s guilty,\u201d said Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington State who has worked on several cases involving these warrants. Potential suspects must still be fully investigated, he added. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were there.\u201d\nIt is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions, because many of the investigations are still open and judges frequently seal the warrants. The practice was first used by federal agents in 2016, according to Google employees, and first publicly reported last year in North Carolina. It has since spread to local departments across the country, including in California, Florida, Minnesota and Washington. This year, one Google employee said, the company received as many as 180 requests in one week. Google declined to confirm precise numbers.\nThe technique illustrates a phenomenon privacy advocates have long referred to as the \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d principle \u2014 anytime a technology company creates a system that could be used in surveillance, law enforcement inevitably comes knocking. Sensorvault, according to Google employees, includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decade.\nThe new orders, sometimes called \u201cgeofence\u201d warrants, specify an area and a time period, and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there. It labels them with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the users\u2019 names and other information.\n\u2018\u2018There are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked \u2014 and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case, that should give everybody serious pause,\u201d said Catherine Turner, a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the technique.\nInvestigators who spoke with The New York Times said they had not sent geofence warrants to companies other than Google, and Apple said it did not have the ability to perform those searches. Google would not provide details on Sensorvault, but Aaron Edens, an intelligence analyst with the sheriff\u2019s office in San Mateo County, Calif., who has examined data from hundreds of phones, said most Android devices and some iPhones he had seen had this data available from Google.\nIn a statement, Richard Salgado, Google\u2019s director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to \u201cvigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement.\u201d He added that it handed over identifying information only \u201cwhere legally required.\u201d\nMr. Molina, 24, said he was shocked when the police told him they suspected him of murder, and he was surprised at their ability to arrest him based largely on data.\n\u201cI just kept thinking, You\u2019re innocent, so you\u2019re going to get out,\u201d he said, but he added that he worried that it could take months or years to be exonerated. \u201cI was scared,\u201d he said.\nA Novel Approach\nDetectives have used the warrants for help with robberies, sexual assaults, arsons and murders. Last year, federal agents requested the data to investigate a string of bombings around Austin, Tex.\nRich Harris / The New York Times\nAustin investigators obtained another warrant after a fourth bomb exploded. But the suspect killed himself three days after that bomb, as they were closing in. Officials at the time said surveillance video and receipts for suspicious purchases helped identify him.\nAn F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the response from Google was helpful or timely, saying that any question about the technique \u201ctouches on areas we don\u2019t discuss.\u201d\nOfficers who have used the warrants said they showed promise in finding suspects as well as witnesses who may have been near the crime without realizing it. The searches may also be valuable in cold cases. A warrant last year in Florida, for example, sought information on a murder from 2016. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the data was helpful.\nThe approach has yielded useful information even if it wasn\u2019t what broke the case open, investigators said. In a home invasion in Minnesota, for example, Google data showed a phone taking the path of the likely intruder, according to a news report and police documents. But detectives also cited other leads, including a confidential informant, in developing suspects. Four people were charged in federal court.\nAccording to several current and former Google employees, the Sensorvault database was not designed for the needs of law enforcement, raising questions about its accuracy in some situations.\nThough Google\u2019s data cache is enormous, it doesn\u2019t sweep up every phone, said Mr. Edens, the California intelligence analyst. And even if a location is recorded every few minutes, that may not coincide with a shooting or an assault.\nGoogle often doesn\u2019t provide information right away, investigators said. The Google unit handling the requests has struggled to keep up, so it can take weeks or months for a response. In the Arizona investigation, police received data six months after sending the warrant. In a different Minnesota case this fall, it came in four weeks.\nBut despite the drawbacks, detectives noted how precise the data was and how it was collected even when people weren\u2019t making calls or using apps \u2014 both improvements over tracking that relies on cell towers.\n\u201cIt shows the whole pattern of life,\u201d said Mark Bruley, the deputy police chief in Brooklyn Park, Minn., where investigators have been using the technique since this fall. \u201cThat\u2019s the game changer for law enforcement.\u201d\nA Trove of Data\nLocation data is a lucrative business \u2014 and Google is by far the biggest player, propelled largely by its Android phones. It uses the data to power advertising tailored to a person\u2019s location, part of a more than $20 billion market for location-based ads last year.\nIn 2009, the company introduced Location History, a feature for users who wanted to see where they had been. Sensorvault stores information on anyone who has opted in, allowing regular collection of data from GPS signals, cellphone towers, nearby Wi-Fi devices and Bluetooth beacons.\nPeople who turn on the feature can see a timeline of their activity and get recommendations based on it. Google apps prompt users to enable Location History for things like traffic alerts. Information in the database is held indefinitely, unless the user deletes it.\n\u201cWe citizens are giving this stuff away,\u201d said Mr. Ernsdorff, the Washington State prosecutor, adding that if companies were collecting data, law enforcement should be able to obtain a court order to use it.\nCurrent and former Google employees said they were surprised by the warrants. Brian McClendon, who led the development of Google Maps and related products until 2015, said he and other engineers had assumed the police would seek data only on specific people. The new technique, he said, \u201cseems like a fishing expedition.\u201d\nUncharted Legal Territory\nThe practice raises novel legal issues, according to Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on criminal law in the digital age.\nOne concern: the privacy of innocent people scooped up in these searches. Several law enforcement officials said the information remained sealed in their jurisdictions but not in every state.\nIn Minnesota, for example, the name of an innocent man was released to a local journalist after it became part of the police record. Investigators had his information because he was within 170 feet of a burglary. Reached by a reporter, the man said he was surprised about the release of his data and thought he might have appeared because he was a cabdriver. \u201cI drive everywhere,\u201d he said.\nThese searches also raise constitutional questions. The Fourth Amendment says a warrant must request a limited search and establish probable cause that evidence related to a crime will be found.\nWarrants reviewed by The Times frequently established probable cause by explaining that most Americans owned cellphones and that Google held location data on many of these phones. The areas they targeted ranged from single buildings to multiple blocks, and most sought data over a few hours. In the Austin case, warrants covered several dozen houses around each bombing location, for times ranging from 12 hours to a week. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Google responded to all the requests, and multiple officials said they had seen the company push back on broad searches.\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant was required for historical data about a person\u2019s cellphone location over weeks, but the court has not ruled on anything like geofence searches, including a technique that pulls information on all phones registered to a cell tower.\nGoogle\u2019s legal staff decided even before the 2018 ruling that the company would require warrants for location inquiries, and it crafted the procedure that first reveals only anonymous data.\n\u201cNormally we think of the judiciary as being the overseer, but as the technology has gotten more complex, courts have had a harder and harder time playing that role,\u201d said Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWe\u2019re depending on companies to be the intermediary between people and the government.\u201d\nIn several cases reviewed by The Times, a judge approved the entire procedure in a single warrant, relying on investigators\u2019 assurances that they would seek data for only the most relevant devices. Google responds to those orders, but Mr. Kerr said it was unclear whether multistep warrants should pass legal muster.\nSome jurisdictions require investigators to return to a judge and obtain a second warrant before getting identifying information. With another warrant, investigators can obtain more extensive data, including months of location patterns and even emails.\nMixed Results\nInvestigators in Arizona have never publicly disclosed a likely motive in the killing of Joseph Knight, the crime for which Mr. Molina was arrested. In a court document, they described Mr. Knight, a 29-year-old aircraft repair company employee, as having no known history of drug use or gang activity.\nDetectives sent the geofence warrant to Google soon after the murder and received data from four devices months later. One device, a phone Google said was linked to Mr. Molina\u2019s account, appeared to follow the path of the gunman\u2019s car as seen on video. His carrier also said the phone was associated with a tower in roughly the same area, and his Google history showed a search about local shootings the day after the attack.\nAfter his arrest, Mr. Molina told officers that Marcos Gaeta, his mother\u2019s ex-boyfriend, had sometimes taken his car. The Times found a traffic ticket showing that Mr. Gaeta, 38, had driven that car without a license. Mr. Gaeta also had a lengthy criminal record.\nWhile Mr. Molina was in jail, a friend told his public defender, Jack Litwak, that she was with him at his home about the time of the shooting, and she and others provided texts and Uber receipts to bolster his case. His home, where he lives with his mother and three siblings, is about two miles from the murder scene.\nMr. Litwak said his investigation found that Mr. Molina had sometimes signed in to other people\u2019s phones to check his Google account. That could lead someone to appear in two places at once, though it was not clear whether that happened in this case.\nMr. Gaeta was arrested in California on an Arizona warrant. He was then charged in a separate California homicide from 2016. Officials said that case would probably delay his extradition to Arizona.\nA police spokesman said \u201cnew information came to light\u201d after Mr. Molina\u2019s arrest, but the department would not comment further.\nMonths after his release, Mr. Molina was having trouble getting back on his feet. After being arrested at work, a Macy\u2019s warehouse, he lost his job. His car was impounded for investigation and then repossessed.\nThe investigators \u201chad good intentions\u201d in using the technique, Mr. Litwak said. But, he added, \u201cthey\u2019re hyping it up to be this new DNA type of forensic evidence, and it\u2019s just not.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The feeds are streamed publicly online.\nWe were able to turn those cameras into a facial recognition-powered tracking system for less than $100 \u2014 using a service available to anyone with an internet connection and a credit card. The process was completely legal.\nHow easy would it be to figure out who was in the park? We built a database using public photos of people who work in the area and matched this college professor on his way to lunch. All it took was a few days\u2019 work.\nThe cameras are just three among thousands across New York City. And if you\u2019re an adult in America, there\u2019s more than a 50 percent chance that you\u2019re already in a law enforcement facial recognition database, according to researchers at Georgetown.\nMost people pass through some type of public space in their daily routine \u2014 sidewalks, roads, train stations. Thousands walk through Bryant Park every day. But we generally think that a detailed log of our location, and a list of the people we\u2019re with, is private. Facial recognition, applied to the web of cameras that already exists in most cities, is a threat to that privacy.\nTo demonstrate how easy it is to track people without their knowledge, we collected public images of people who worked near Bryant Park (available on their employers\u2019 websites, for the most part) and ran one day of footage through Amazon\u2019s commercial facial recognition service. Our system detected 2,750 faces from a nine-hour period (not necessarily unique people, since a person could be captured in multiple frames). It returned several possible identifications, including one frame matched to a head shot of Richard Madonna, a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry, with an 89 percent similarity score. The total cost: about $60.\n\u201cMy first reaction was, \u2018Oh my god, that is unbelievable,\u2019\u201d Dr. Madonna said, after we reached him and explained the experiment. \u201cI was shocked at how readily it seems that it picked me up, because, really \u2014 it\u2019s the side of my head.\u201d\nIn our exercise, we built a database using only photos from public websites, and we obtained Dr. Madonna\u2019s consent before publishing this story. We\u2019ve deleted the images and data that we collected and are no longer monitoring the Bryant Park cameras.\nOver decades, businesses and individuals have installed millions of cameras like the ones we used, inadvertently setting up the infrastructure for mass surveillance. In the past, a human would have to watch the video feed to identify people, making it impossible to comprehensively record everyone\u2019s movements. But the accuracy and speed of modern facial recognition technology means that building a dragnet surveillance system is now feasible.\nThe law has not caught up. In the United States, the use of facial recognition is almost wholly unregulated.\n\u201cThe technology has advanced faster than even I thought that it would,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She said that because of how quickly the technology has advanced, she would now support a wholesale ban on government use of facial recognition.\nThe cameras in Bryant Park were installed more than a decade ago so that people could see whether the lawn was open for sunbathing, for example, or check how busy the ice skating rink was in the winter. They are not intended to be a security device, according to the corporation that runs the park.\nBut our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn people\u2019s daily habits: when they arrive at the office each day, who they get coffee with, whether they left work early. When we identified Dr. Madonna, he was on his way to lunch with a job candidate \u2014 an example of how the midday outings of even law-abiding citizens can sometimes be sensitive information.\nThe police and governments may also have access to a vast network of cameras. Combine that with a comprehensive database of faces \u2014 like a driver\u2019s license database \u2014 and it\u2019s possible to track citizens throughout an entire region in real time. There is no evidence that this is happening on a wide scale in the United States. But that\u2019s not because the technology doesn\u2019t exist. Last year, companies claimed they could compare live feeds to a database of billions of faces.\nAuthorities have used facial recognition to track down criminal suspects and find missing children. But civil liberties advocates warn about the chilling effect on free speech if the government could monitor everyone\u2019s whereabouts \u2014 or, say, identify individuals at a protest. This is not a purely hypothetical concern: During 2016 protests after Freddie Gray died in the custody of Baltimore police, law enforcement used facial recognition on social media images to identify protesters with outstanding warrants.\n\"Once the government has the ability to track us and identify us wherever we go, it is impossible to speak and participate in society anonymously,\" Ms. Lynch said.\nFacial recognition in New York City\nNew York City is nowhere near China, where the government has installed approximately one surveillance camera for every seven citizens. But according to the A.C.L.U., police here have access to more than 9,000 camera feeds in Lower Manhattan alone.\nThe M.T.A. has tried using facial recognition on feeds from license-plate cameras at the city\u2019s entry points to identify drivers through their windshields, although those efforts have been unsuccessful so far, according to The Wall Street Journal. And the Department of Transportation already has hundreds of cameras across New York City used to monitor traffic, feeds that are also streamed publicly online.\nThe traffic cameras are most likely too low-resolution for effective facial recognition. But the city\u2019s LinkNYC kiosks, which are scattered through the streets and intended to provide free wireless internet, each have two security cameras. Law enforcement agencies need a subpoena or court order to gain access to the footage, and using facial recognition is against the policy of the company that owns the kiosks. However, the existence of more than 3,000 additional cameras has raised concerns about their potential to bolster the city\u2019s surveillance capabilities.\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nTraffic camera\nManhattan\nqueens\nBrooklyn\nCameras on\nNew York City Streets\nLinkNYC kiosk\nManhattan\nTraffic camera\nBrooklyn\nDetails are sparse, but there is evidence that those capabilities are formidable. The Police Department claims its Domain Awareness System, developed jointly with Microsoft (which also offers facial recognition software), \u201cutilizes the largest network of cameras, license plate readers, and radiological sensors in the world.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the Domain Awareness System currently uses facial recognition, though the Police Department experimented with it in 2012, according to Clare Garvie, an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School. The police have been reluctant to divulge details, and the center has sued the department for more information.\n\u201cWe compare facial images picked up by cameras at crime scenes to mugshots in law enforcement records,\u201d said Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the department, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe do not engage in mass or random collection of facial records from N.Y.P.D. camera systems, the internet, or social media.\u201d\nLaw enforcement use of the technology\nAmazon is one of several companies that sell facial recognition services to the public. The company has highlighted positive applications of the service we used, Rekognition, such as its ability to help find lost children. It insists that it requires customers comply with the law and respect others\u2019 rights, but has been criticized for pushing its technology to law enforcement agencies.\nRekognition is already actively used by the sheriff\u2019s office in Washington County, Ore., including to investigate minor crimes like shoplifting. The Orlando, Fla., Police Department is also using the technology in a pilot program.\nAmazon notes that its service makes predictions, not decisions, and that the confidence level the service provides should be incorporated in a human review process. The company recommends using a threshold of at least 99 percent for applications of its facial recognition service that involve identification or public safety, though critics of the technology say that the scoring is opaque and that the company has no way of enforcing that threshold. None of the matches we obtained from the Bryant Park footage, correct or incorrect, met the threshold.\nMatt Wood, the general manager of artificial intelligence for Amazon Web Services, noted that it is possible that Rekognition, like other types of information available to law enforcement officials, could be used inappropriately. \u201cThe law enforcement agency will have to be accountable to these individuals and to the law if they violate people\u2019s civil liberties,\u201d he said. He added that the company has not received any reports of misuse by law enforcement.\nIn January, however, the A.C.L.U. sent a letter to Amazon asking it to stop selling facial recognition technology to police and government agencies, saying that the company\u2019s attention to civil liberties has lagged behind that of Google and Microsoft.\n\u201cRekognition marketing materials read like a user manual for authoritarian surveillance,\u201d said Nicole Ozer, the technology and civil liberties director for the A.C.L.U. of California, in a statement last year.\nRegulate or ban?\nIn the United States, there are no federal laws that restrict the use of facial recognition. Most states don\u2019t have regulations (exceptions include Illinois and Texas), nor does New York City, though a city councilman proposed legislation last year that would require businesses to disclose their use of the technology. That would apply to our exercise, but would not extend to law enforcement\u2019s use of facial recognition.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a wild, wild west out there,\u201d Ms. Lynch, the E.F.F. lawyer, said.\nThe lack of regulation has opened the door to a wide range of applications. In 2007, an Arizona sheriff\u2019s office enrolled all of Honduras\u2019s driver\u2019s licenses and mugshots into its database, and a Florida sheriff\u2019s office runs 8,000 searches each month without requiring its officers to have reasonable suspicion of a crime, according to the Georgetown report.\nThe Georgetown center along with the E.F.F. and others have proposed regulations, including requiring that authorities have reasonable suspicion before conducting a search; prohibiting, except in life-or-death situations, live facial recognition searches using driver\u2019s license databases; and forbidding tracking individuals based on political beliefs, race or religion.\nAmazon itself has called for a legal framework that incorporates human review and transparency. But some say that the technology is so dangerous that no regulation is sufficient.\n\u201cThe future of human flourishing depends upon facial recognition technology being banned,\u201d wrote Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern, and Evan Selinger, a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, last year. \u201cOtherwise, people won\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be in public without being automatically identified, profiled, and potentially exploited.\u201d\nFacial recognition is categorically different from other forms of surveillance, Mr. Hartzog said, and uniquely dangerous. Faces are hard to hide and can be observed from far away, unlike a fingerprint. Name and face databases of law-abiding citizens, like driver\u2019s license records, already exist. And for the most part, facial recognition surveillance can be set up using cameras already on the streets.\nIt might be too late for a moratorium or ban, however. Facial recognition is already being used by police departments around the country, Ms. Garvie said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lock law enforcement agencies into 20th-century technology just because 21st-century technology raises very serious risks,\u201d she said.\nDr. Madonna, the person we identified, said he understood that tension. He was initially astonished when we reached out to him, but he said that as a doctor, he often talks to students about the ratio of risk to benefit. He saw the tremendous benefits that facial recognition could offer, he said.\nBut the technology is open to abuse, he added, when individuals or governments can use facial recognition to track any group, or just about any ordinary citizen \u2014 even someone walking through Bryant Park.\nDesigned by Jessia Ma.

These digital ads are powered by vast, hidden datasets that allow advertisers to make eerily accurate guesses about who you are, where you\u2019ve been, how you feel and what you might do next.\nWhile targeted ads may be familiar by now, how they work \u2014 and the power they have \u2014 often seems invisible.\nWe decided to lift the veil on this part of the internet economy, so we bought some ad space. We picked 16 categories (like registered Democrats or people trying to lose weight) and targeted ads at people in them. But instead of trying to sell cars or prescription drugs, we used the ads to reveal the invisible information itself.\nHere\u2019s what one ad looked like. The underlined text below shows what the ad knows about the person who\u2019s seeing it.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThe second frame of the ad:\nThis was an experiment in how far digital advertisers go to collect and use information about every part of our lives for profit. But it\u2019s also the story of how our information is used not just to target us but to manipulate others for economic and political ends \u2014 invisibly, and in ways that are difficult to scrutinize or even question. And it\u2019s a warning sign about the real-world political risks that come from this sophisticated guessing game, which is played in billions of transactions each day.\n\u201cThe way ads are targeted today is radically different from the way it was done 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d said Frederike Kaltheuner, who heads the corporate exploitation program at Privacy International. \u201cIt\u2019s become exponentially more invasive, and most people are completely unaware of what kinds of data feeds into the targeting.\u201d\nWith that in mind, we want to share how we targeted these ads, what we learned, and why it might disturb you.\nThe narrowest slices of the Internet\nTargeted advertising was once limited to simple contextual cues: visiting ESPN probably meant you\u2019d see an ad for Nike. But advertising services today use narrow categories drawn from a mind-boggling number of sources to single out consumers. (Like many publishers, The Times uses targeted advertising to find potential subscribers and readers.)\nTo build the ads for our experiment, we imagined some extremely specific targets and built profiles of those people. Then we chose 16 attributes that matched those profiles from a list of about 30,000 \u2014 a list that\u2019s rarely seen by people outside the industry.\nWe could do this because many companies, like retailers and credit card providers, sell customer information to data companies. Most data providers declined to tell us where their data comes from or how they built their models, so the sources in the ads below come from the ad experts who helped us create the campaign. Our experiment would have been blocked on Facebook because the company bans most ads showing how you\u2019ve been targeted.\nHere are more sample ads that we bought as part of our experiment. (These ads, like all the ads shown in this story, aren\u2019t live and don\u2019t show data about you specifically.)\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male, actively\nconsolidating your debt and are a high\nspender at luxury department stores.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nactively consolidating your\ndebt and are a high spender\nat luxury department stores.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re trying to\nlose weight but still love bakeries.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re trying to\nlose weight but still\nlove bakeries.\nlikely browsing history\nlikely credit card\nBut that\u2019s just the start. Launching a political campaign \u2014 or trying to interfere with one? You could target potential political converts:\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re female, a\nregistered Democrat and are likely to\nvote for the sitting president.\nlikely voter registration\nlikely browsing history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re\nfemale, a registered\nDemocrat and are likely to\nvote for the sitting president.\nlikely voting registration\nlikely browsing history\n\u201cIn the next election, I think it is inevitable that every single voter will have been profiled based on what they have been reading, watching and listening to for years online,\u201d said Johnny Ryan, the chief policy officer at Brave, a private web browser that allows users to block ads and trackers.\nCompanies can target by location, too. It\u2019s possible to single out bankers on Wall Street or political aides on Capitol Hill. If you wanted to target any specific location, you could find an ad platform that could do it (but the accuracy would vary depending on the technology used).\nIt\u2019s not limited to what advertisers know about your past behavior, either. Data providers claim they can predict things you didn\u2019t directly disclose, including what you\u2019ll do in the future. They don\u2019t have your voting history, but they can still guess whether you\u2019re a likely liberal or a likely conservative. They also say they know whether you\u2019re planning a foreign vacation in the next year.\n\u201cSurveillance companies are learning to nudge, coax, tune and herd human behavior in the direction that they want people to go for the sake of the commercial outcomes that their business customers seek,\u201d said Shoshana Zuboff, Harvard Business School professor emerita and author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism.\u201d\nPredictions about who people are and what they will buy offer the most promise to advertisers because they enable targeting nearly everyone, even those with little data available.\nAcxiom, a major marketing data company, said it makes predictions by comparing specific people to a much larger group. For example, it might predict whether you\u2019ll buy an S.U.V. by looking at people who did buy S.U.V.s, then checking whether you live in a similar region, or whether you\u2019re around the same age and share similar interests. If you\u2019re similar, they\u2019ll put you in a bucket that says you\u2019re highly likely to buy an S.U.V. And if you\u2019re the one who\u2019s buying the S.U.V., your characteristics might be used to refine the pool of potential future S.U.V. buyers.\n\u201cThose predictive models and those audiences are defined by the simple principle of \u2018birds of a feather flock together,\u2019\u201d said Chad Engelgau, chief strategy and marketing officer at Acxiom. He added that prediction categories are used when data companies don\u2019t have more specific data, so they might guess the likelihood that you\u2019re a parent who needs to buy diapers using a predictive category rather than learning directly by collecting new birth records.\n\u201cNobody in the industry is saying this is a fact,\u201d he said of the predictions. \u201cIt\u2019s used to create efficiencies.\u201d\n[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel\u2019s limited-run newsletter to explore what\u2019s at stake and what you can do about it.]\nThe accuracy of predictions made by data providers is difficult to verify. The companies release little evidence that those included in these groups actually belong there. A study from 2018 found that the gender assigned by data brokers was accurate, on average, only 42 percent of the time \u2014 that\u2019s worse than just flipping a coin. So in the ads we bought, we expected many men would see ads aimed at women and vice versa.\nAcxiom said it\u2019s working on adding more transparency to its models, including better labeling and third-party audits. It has also joined many other data companies calling for federal regulation that would place limits on how data is collected and shared while leaving room for marketing purposes. But such a law could also weaken or replace much more aggressive state regulations, like California\u2019s data protection law.\nData providers also say the information stored and shared is anonymous, but that doesn\u2019t mean it stays that way. In 2017, for example, German researchers tied data that was supposedly anonymous back to specific individuals. They found revealing things like the medication used by a German politician and a German judge\u2019s use of pornography.\nWhere the data comes from\nToday\u2019s data providers can receive information from almost every imaginable part of your life: your activity on the internet, the places you visit, the stores you walk through, the things you buy, the things you like, who your friends are, the places your friends go, the things your friends do, and on and on. One provider boasts about having \u201cprecise second-by-second viewing of tens of millions of televisions in all 210 local markets across the country.\u201d If you responded to an online event invitation, the details could be used to target you. If you\u2019re listening to energetic music, you could be targeted almost instantly in an energetic mood group. Much of this data could be shared among brands.\nYou might find targeted ads preferable to general ones since there\u2019s a better chance that you might actually want to buy the products being marketed. But privacy advocates say targeting has gotten out of control.\n\u201cDo you really need to track people on all the websites they visit, every single app they use, on their entire platform, and keep the data for a shockingly long time?\u201d asked Ms. Kaltheuner, from Privacy International. \u201cIs all of this really necessary to show relevant ads?\u201d\nAds in our experiment combined data from many of these sources.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nwork in media,\nand cut the cable cord.\nLIKELY credit card\nLIKELY work email\nLIKELY social media\nLIKELY smart home devices\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\nwork in media,\nand cut the cable cord.\nLikely work email\nLikely\ncredit card\nLikely social media\nLikely smart\nhome devices\nJust by browsing the web, you\u2019re sending valuable data to trackers and ad platforms. Websites can also provide marketers specific things they know about you, like your date of birth or email address.\nAd companies often identify you when you load a website using trackers and cookies \u2014 small files containing information about you. Then your data is shared with multiple advertisers who bid to fill the ad space. The winning bid gets to fill the ad slot.\nAll of this happens in milliseconds.\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re a\ncybersecurity expert, female\nand go to art events in the desert.\nLIKELY browsing history\nLIKELY browsing history\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re a\ncybersecurity expert,\nfemale and go to art\nevents in the desert.\nLIKELY browsing history\nSample of an ad bought by Times Opinion (not a live ad):\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male, a C-suite\nexecutive and binge-watch reality\ndating shows.\nlikely work email\nlikely Smart TV\nThis ad thinks you\u2019re male,\na C-suite executive and\nbinge-watch reality\ndating shows.\nlikely work email\nlikely Smart TV\nDr. Zuboff, the author and professor, argues that companies today are mining private lives the same way they exploit natural resources, turning them into profitable goods. She said that makes every \u201csmart\u201d device and \u201cpersonalized\u201d service just another way to collect data for the surveillance economy.\nThat change happened so quickly and so secretly, Dr. Zuboff argues, that the public is not equipped to fight back.\nMs. Kaltheuner agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s about ads, but it has all these other implications that have nothing to do with ads,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the price we\u2019re paying to see \u2018relevant\u2019 ads.\u201d\nStuart A.

Beijing disabled Xinjiang\u2019s internet, sending military police to restore order. The blackout lasted nearly a year. Now, a decade later, Xinjiang is writhing under a new clampdown aimed at the Uighurs. This time, Beijing has embraced the opposite philosophy: a digital panopticon, enlisting private tech firms to expand China\u2019s internet of things and enmesh its own people.\nThe technologies being honed in Xinjiang, driven by this kind of illiberal innovation, may be coming soon to an app store near you. These exports risk enabling aspiring autocrats worldwide, and may concentrate alarming power in the hands of China\u2019s Communist Party.\nUntil recently, China was dismissed as an innovation laggard that copied technology from the West. Today, many Chinese tech sectors have leapfrogged Silicon Valley, sometimes with heavy-handed help from the party. Consumer-friendly smartphone apps have pushed cash, credit cards and identification documents toward extinction. Hotel booking systems will ping your smartphone, linked to your national ID card, to let you check in using facial recognition. In under a minute, a mom-and-pop hardware kiosk can create a personalized QR code for cashless payments through WeChat, an indispensable app that combines the functions of WhatsApp, Venmo, Seamless, Uber and more. For an expatriate accustomed to China\u2019s freewheeling start-up scene and whizzy tech conveniences, coming home can feel like stepping back in time.\nBut, as the Uighur minority of Xinjiang are learning, that convenience comes at an Orwellian price. Speedy data networks and integrated digital commerce are learning to work with the party\u2019s aggressive security apparatus. Invasive DNA databases and facial recognition powered by artificial intelligence have created a digital dragnet, enhanced by mandatory surveillance apps installed on smartphones and backed by a newly built network of IRL gulags. Offenses as trivial as forwarding a traditional Islamic holiday greeting on WeChat, or posting a bearded selfie, can land citizens in internment camps. Even Uighurs living abroad are entangled, through their families and their smartphones, in Beijing\u2019s crackdown. (The repression has reportedly created a black market in old Nokia phones, which are less legible to the state.)\nXinjiang\u2019s plight is more than a local tragedy: It is a warning.\nThe global risk from China\u2019s technology sector is not necessarily a sinister conspiracy to exert Xinjiang-style controls overseas. Beijing\u2019s leaders are focused on domestic affairs and for now, China\u2019s budding tech dystopia is still more \u201cBrazil\u201d than \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Rather, this risk is a byproduct of Beijing\u2019s business as usual, on a huge global scale.\nProducts created for China\u2019s vast surveilled and censored domestic market are increasingly popular overseas, where they are often cheaper and more appealing to consumers. Huawei, for instance, has honed its 5G wireless technology \u2014 which will support the next generation of data-intensive, A.I.-powered gadgets \u2014 in China\u2019s domestic, bleeding-edge consumer market for the internet of things. Many Huawei phones are bought by Chinese who have never owned a PC or other digital device, giving the company an edge in imagining and designing mobile products for developing markets that skipped over the PC era. Huawei\u2019s cheaper (and often subsidized) price points, and comparable or superior products, have made its phones a better-value purchase than the iPhone for cost-savvy consumers around the world, and its 5G infrastructure attractive for penny-pinching governments. Most are unaware, or apparently unconcerned, about censorship or surveillance.\nThey should be worried. According to the Soviet-style playbook that still influences Chinese security services, collecting haystacks of citizen information, by whatever means necessary, is the foundation of social control and \u201cstability maintenance.\u201d\nThe Soviet model was an analog blend of Big Brother and big data, amassing reams of information about citizens to understand their fears, vulnerabilities and intentions, and pre-empt any challenge to the Party-State\u2019s power. China has adapted this paranoid style to the modern tech age. Private corporations and the Communist Party\u2019s security apparatus have grown together, discovering how the same data sets can both cater to consumers and help commissars calibrate repression.\nThe party\u2019s instinctual contempt for privacy, married to its proactive industrial policy, can be a boon for well-connected private businesses. Many tech firms make a point of hiring the relatives of high party officials, and a vast state database of headshots might be shared with a private firm to train new facial recognition software, while the firm\u2019s trove of real-time user data might be offered to police, for a panoramic view of potential \u201ctroublemakers.\u201d\nBetween the Communist Party\u2019s repressive impulses, its influence over China\u2019s vast and innovative tech ecosystem, and new technology\u2019s general propensity to disrupt and surprise, it is na\u00efve to expect that we can fully anticipate and mitigate the impact of illiberal innovations exported abroad. Even innocuous-seeming technology, when paired with China\u2019s authoritarian impulses and state-led development model, may challenge liberal values in unexpected ways.\nConsider TikTok, a social video-sharing app that last year had more downloads on the Apple app store than Instagram. TikTok fills a market niche abandoned by Vine, the American-grown short-video-sharing app shuttered by Twitter in 2017. Users can upload videos of themselves or friends lip-synching the latest pop tunes or decorating or distorting their faces, all easily edited into a clip for other users to \u201clike,\u201d \u201cshare\u201d or comment on.\nTo China\u2019s surveillance state, a video-sharing app offers much more than than your dog dancing to Drake. TikTok\u2019s domestic Chinese version, Douyin, is heavily censored and surveilled: Last year, the British cartoon Peppa Pig was purged from the platform after the authorities decided she had taken on subversive meaning. (It is unclear whether this was because of a direct government order or the company pre-emptively censoring itself.)\nFor residents of Xinjiang, posting a video of traditional Uighur music sung in their native language might be flagged by machine-learning algorithms, and bring a deletion and a visit from the police. In what appear to be precautionary performances of loyalty to the government, Uighur users of Douyin have recorded themselves singing pro-party songs, pointedly in Mandarin. Given the wide use of facial recognition across Xinjiang, and the potential sharing of security data sets between state agencies and private firms, Douyin\u2019s raw video data may also offer a tempting training set for machine-learning software. (Recent leaks have shown China\u2019s developing capability to match GPS coordinates with Uighur facial recognition data; with help from a Yale professor and an American biotech firm, Thermo Fisher, China has also built a database of Uighur DNA.)\nTo date, no evidence suggests that Chinese authorities have used their leverage over Douyin domestically to censor or surveil TikTok overseas. But given what we know about Beijing\u2019s illiberal impulses, there is a gap between what is provable beforehand, and what it is prudent to presume. The brazen lying that is normalized in China\u2019s corporate and political culture, and the meaninglessness of written rules, mean that published regulations, or guarantees by private firms and government officials, are simply not credible. (Just ask Prof. Kenneth Kidd, the geneticist at Yale who accepted assurances from his Chinese counterparts that DNA samples for their joint project would be ethically obtained. Dr. Kidd claimed to be shocked \u2014 shocked \u2014 to discover that the Ministry of Public Security\u2019s sweet nothings can\u2019t be taken at face value.

But the choices of ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, are rational; it fears the Communist Party more than angry tweets from tweens outside the Great Firewall.\nThe West\u2019s increasing technological and economic exposure to China may have unintended consequences. Over a decade ago, the singer Bj\u00f6rk was banned from China, and muzzled within the Great Firewall, for advocating Tibetan independence during a concert in Shanghai. If, tomorrow, Bj\u00f6rk followed up with a TikTok video pleading for Uighur rights, and the clip went viral globally, would the party be able to resist the temptation to lean on ByteDance to slow or stop it? If your face appears in the background of another person\u2019s TikTok video shot in Berlin, will it be logged using facial recognition software running in Shanghai?

Talks Open; Soviet Agrees to Shun Blockade Zone Now\nSpecial to The New York Timesashington, Oct. 26--The White House made public tonight a new intelligence report showing that construction of Soviet missile bases in Cuba was proceeding at a rapid rate with the apparent intention of \"achieving a full operational capability as soon as possible.\"\nHigh officials said that such work could not be allowed to continue indefinitely.\nThere was some encouragement here tonight when it became known that Premier Khrushchev had agreed, in response to an appeal by U Thant, Acting Secretary General of the United Nations, to order Soviet ships bound for Cuba to stay away temporarily from the blockade zone.\nMissile Sites Crucial\nHowever, officials here have always thought that the real clue to Soviet intentions was not whether the Russians would attempt to challenge the blockade but whether they would continue or discontinue construction work on the offensive missile sites.\nTherefore, President Kennedy, in a message to MR. Thant assuring him that American ships would do everything possible to avoid a direct confrontation with Soviet ships outside the blockade zone, reiterated United States \"requirements\" that the offensive-weapons systems be withdrawn.\n\"I must point out to you,\" he wrote to Mr. Thant, \"that present work on these systems is still continuing.\"\nThe verified cessations of work on these sites, officials said, was a prime condition for agreements by the United States to enter into talks with the Soviet Union.\nDirect Action Weighed\nOfficials close to rapidly moving developments indicated that, unless work on the sites came to a halt within a few days, the United States must consider what further action should be taken toward achieving its firm objective of the elimination of the missiles.\nThese and other developments strengthened the impression in the capital that the Government was looking beyond the effort to settle the Cuban crisis at the United Nations and toward the possibility of further direct action by the United States.\nThe general expectation here was that the Soviet Union would refuse to meet the American condition that the construction must be brought to a verified halt before talks on the substance of the dispute could begin. These were the elements in the evolving situation that underlined the Government's apparent resolution:\nIn a meeting this morning of the executive committee of the National Security Council, according to informed sources, Adlai E. Stevenson, to make clear to Mr. Thant that the United States was immovable in its determination to get the missile bases out of Cuba. The White House said this afternoon that \"the Soviets are rapidly continuing their construction of missile and launch facilities\" and gave no evidence of \"any intention to dismantle or discontinue work on these missile sites.\" The State Department this morning drew attention to a sentence in President Kennedy's speech of Monday night that read: \"Should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat of the hemisphere, further action will be justified.\" In the Organization of American States, Latin-American Ambassadors agreed with the United States view that the resolution unanimously approved last Tuesday gave the United States and other members of the O.A.S. the right to dismantle the missile bases by force if necessary. Although Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, denied reports that Congressional leaders had been asked by the President to return to Washington next Monday, sources on Capitol Hill said these leaders understood after the second meeting with the President on Wednesday that they would return Monday for a report and further discussion of the situation.\nThe White House also announced that President and Mrs. Kennedy would postpone their state visit to Brazil next month.\nThe President planned to meet tomorrow with the Civil Defense Committee of the Governors Conference, a group headed by Governor Rockefeller.\nActivity Found Continuing\nIn its statement, the White House said that, as of yesterday, \"definite build-ups in these offensive missile sites continued to be made.\"\n\"The activity of these sites,\" the statement continued, \"apparently is directed at achieving a full operational capability as soon as possible.\"\nAt the sites being constructed for intermediate-range ballistic missiles, with a reported reach of more than 2,000 miles, the White House said, bulldozers and cranes were observed yesterday \"actively clearing new areas within the sites and improving the approach roads to the launch pads.\"\n\"For example,\" the White House reported, \"missiles were observed parked in the open on Oct. 23. Surveillance on Oct. 25 revealed that some of these same missiles have now been moved from their original parked positions. Cabling can be seen running from the missile-ready tents to power generators nearby.\"\nConditions on U.N. Talks\nOfficials did not expect the climax to be reached in gunfire at sea but in the political arena at the United Nations over the conditions the United States will set on the beginning to talks. Officials said these conditions are three:\nFirst, work on the missile sites shall stop and not be resumed.\nSecond, the missiles and the sites shall be made and remain totally inoperable.\nThird, no more offensive missiles shall be sent to Cuba.\nThe United States, officials said, will insist that each of these steps must be verified by observers sent by the United Nations.\nThere was little expectation here tonight that the Soviet Union would agree to these conditions, reinforced by inspection. Consequently the White House may have to decide over the weekend what further actions to take. Officials said there were several possible actions short of invasion.\nThe most likely, it is believed, would be extension of the blockade to include all goods. Some officials here are dissatisfied with the limitation of contraband to offensive weapons.\nThey argue that this does not touch the problem since oil, food, machinery and spare parts can be brought in to keep the economy limping along while the missiles are already there in sufficient number to pose a real threat.\nAnother alternative under consideration is pinpoint bombing of the missile sites.\nA third, which would be an accompaniment of either of the first two, would be encouragement of guerrilla warfare.\nOfficials are quite aware that the Soviet Union might respond to either a total blockade or pinpoint bombing by retaliatory action against the access routes to Berlin.\nThis is a matter of great concern, because any action against Cuba that presented the West with the alternative of retreating in Berlin or fighting for it would probably arouse concerns among our European allies. Some officials fear that in such a situation the support that the President had so far had from the NATO countries might weaken.\nHowever, officials here say that this was a risk accepted when the Cuban policy was framed. Furthermore, they say that the allies must also recognize that failure to carry through in Cuba would also gravely impair the West's position in Berlin by casting doubt on the credibility of the United States pledge to fight for Berlin.\nPentagon Stresses Threat\nIf the Soviet Union should agree to the United States conditions, the Administration would be willing to halt the blockade and begin talks aiming at the dismantling of the sites.\nBut officials said that before the United States ships were withdrawn some way must be established to insure that Soviet vessels do not continue to enter Cuban harbors. They point out that it would be easy for United Nations observers to verify that work on missile sites had stopped.\nThe Pentagon, apparently for emphasis, distributed copies of the White House statement that the construction of ballistic missile bases in Cuba was proceeding at an accelerated pace.\nAlso for emphasis apparently, the Pentagon announced an unusual flurry of launchings of the United States' own long-range ballistic missiles for training or scientific purposes. The Pentagon pointed out the following:\nTwo Thors, the 1,500-mile intermediate-range ballistic missile, were used in scientific booster missions, one in the launching of a nuclear device over Johnston Island in the Pacific last midnight, and the other in the launching of an unidentified satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nAlso at Vandenberg, an Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile, with a credited range of 6,000 miles, was launched in a \"routine training\" test. Titan II, ICBM was launched 5,0000 miles in a development test at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, the Pentagon said.\nReturn to the Books Home Page\n|\n|\nHome |\nHelp/Feedback |\nClassifieds |\nServices |", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The novelist, Salman Rushdie, author of ''The Satanic Verses,'' said he was taking the threat seriously.\nThe Teheran radio quoted Ayatollah Khomeini as asking ''all the Muslims to execute them,'' referring to Mr. Rushdie, who lives in London, and the publishers of the book, Viking Penguin, ''wherever they find them.''\nHe said that anyone killed carrying out his order would be considered a martyr.\nMr. Rushdie's American agent said there were no plans to call off the author's American promotional tour. All was quiet at Viking Penguin's offices in New York, but a guard there said security was tight.\nThreat Taken 'Very Seriously'\nWednesday was declared a day of mourning in Iran to protest the novel. It has prompted violent protests by Islamic fundamentalists over the author's projection of Islamic myths and Koranic motifs in contemporary and futuristic settings, which many\ncontend is blasphemous.\n''The author of the 'Satanic Verses' book, which is against Islam, the Prophet and the Koran, and all those involved in its publication who were aware of its content, are sentenced to death,'' said Ayatollah Khomeini, whose\nword is considered law by millions of Shiite Muslims. ''If someone knows them but is unable to kill them, he should hand them over to the people for punishment.''\nMr. Rushdie, who is 41 years old and was born into a Kashmiri Muslim family in Bombay, could not be reached by The New York Times for comment today. But he was quoted as telling the British Broadcasting Corporation that he had to take the threat ''very\nseriously indeed'' and that he ''may well have to think about'' applying to the authorities for protection.\n''I am very sad it should have happened,'' Mr. Rushdie was quoted by the Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, as saying. ''It is not true this book is a blasphemy against Islam. I doubt very much Khomeini\nor anyone else in Iran has read the book or anything more than selected extracts taken out of context.''\nBritain's Foreign Office said today that clarification was being sought over Ayatollah Khomeini's remarks, which, ''if true, are a cause for concern.'' [ A leader of the British Muslims, quoted by Reuters, added grave concern\nto the security situation late tonight by reinforcing Ayatollah Khomeini's call for Mr. Rushdie's execution. Said Abdul Quddas, joint secretary of the Council of Mosques in the northern English city of Bradford,\ntold reporters, ''Every good Muslim is after his life. He has tortured Islam and has to pay the penalty. He deserves hanging. [ ''There are any number of people who would willingly carry out what to\nus would not be a crime but a justified act.'' ] A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to comment on the threat. However, British newspapers said the Special Branch of Scotland Yard was protecting Mr. Rushdie,\nadding that a team of armed officers was probably assigned to accompany the author. Special Branch officers will also increase surveillance on Muslim fundamentalist groups in London and throughout Britain, the agency said.\nThe Khomeini statement came amid a wave of protests and attempts to ban the book. On Sunday, a mob of thousands of enraged Muslims tried to enter and destroy the American cultural center in Islamabad, Pakistan, because Mr. Rushdie's book is being\npublished in the United States. The attack left five people dead and more than 100 people wounded; three people died in similar disturbances in India on Monday.\nMuslims in Britain burned copies of the book last month and W. H. Smith booksellers withdrew it from public display in Bradford, a city in the north that has a large Moslem community.\nThe Press Association quoted Mr. Rushdie's literary agent in Britain, Gillon Aitken, as saying that the author had been ''out and about,'' in response to a question about whether he was in hiding today.\n''I assume he has been getting on with his life,'' Mr. Aitken said.\n''The Satanic Verses'' begins with a plane crash over the English Channel in which two men survive to be ''born again,'' one with a halo, the other with slowly developing horns and hoofs. It is not clear, despite\ntheir appearance, which of them is good and which is evil. They become involved with characters named Alleluia Cone and Mahound, the latter a businessman turned prophet who lives in the imaginary city of Jahilla.\n'A Dirty Conspiracy'\nMr. Rushdie's character the Prophet Mahound resembles the portrayal of Jesus Christ in Martin Scorsese's film ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' in that Mahound is depicted as having a human nature and wrestling with temptation.\nThe work is clearly perceived as offensive to Islam, but what exactly is regarded as insulting has not been spelled out.\nThe Iranian Government condemned the book as ''a dirty conspiracy'' against Islam and urged followers of Ayatollah Khomeini around the world to take action against it. A Government statement read on the Teheran radio called for cells\nof the Party of God -devotees of the Ayatollah and a group of them in Lebanon is believed to be holding Westerners who are missing and believed kidnapped there - to take ''necessary steps to neutralize this plot.''\n''We call on all Party of God cells in the world of Islam to grasp the depth of this black conspiracy,'' the statement said. ''We advise all Islamic Governments not to place themselves against the million masses of angry\nMuslims but to demonstrate their disgust and anger, together with their nation, towards this provocative American deed.''\nThe Iranian press agency quoted Prime Minister Mir Hussein Moussavi as calling Mr. Rushdie an ''American mercenary.''\nMr. Rushdie was quoted as telling Independent Television News here that he doubted that those conducting a campaign against the book were trying to act as ''thought police.''\nReturn to the Books Home Page", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Since the release of Robert Mueller\u2019s report, White House stonewalling of congressional subpoenas and Mr. Mueller\u2019s first public comments, almost 60 House Democrats, a quarter of the caucus, have said they support an impeachment inquiry.\nIf Democrats do move to impeach Mr. Trump, the articles of impeachment drafted against past presidents will probably guide them. The Constitution leaves \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d the term that describes impeachable offenses, vague, notes the historian Timothy Naftali, a co-writer of a recent book on impeachment. \u201cSo if you are doing your constitutional duty as an elected member of Congress, how do you define high crimes and misdemeanors?\u201d he asked. \u201cOne of the ways you do it is by looking at past practice.\u201d\nWhat might impeachment articles against Mr. Trump look like? To find out, we reviewed the articles of impeachment drawn up against Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Then we edited them \u2014 by removing and adding passages \u2014 to match the president\u2019s conduct as described in the Mueller report and elsewhere.\nImpeachment is often said to be a political process. But when you assess Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct by the bar for impeachment set by past Democratic and Republican lawmakers for past presidents of both parties, the results are striking. The pathway to a possible Trump impeachment is already mapped out in these historical documents.\nBased on Nixon\u2019s Impeachment\nIn July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, who resigned before the full House could vote on them. Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior maps neatly onto the first and third Nixon articles, which dealt with obstruction of justice. Nixon interfered with a federal investigation of the Watergate break-in by refusing to turn over documents, pressuring witnesses, lying to the public and firing the special prosecutor assigned to the case. In response to Mr. Mueller\u2019s and Congress\u2019s inquiries, Mr. Trump has similarly stonewalled subpoenas, tried to influence witness testimony, lied and attempted to fire Mr. Mueller.\nArticle I\nThe Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence.May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. The special counsel was also given \u201cthe authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel\u2019s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\u201d Subsequent thereto, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entryRussian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\nThe introduction in the first impeachment article against Nixon sets up the main argument Congress would likely use against Mr. Trump: The president attempted to impede a federal investigation into his actions and those of his associates.\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following:\n* making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States;\n* withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, including congressional committees;\nLike Mr. Trump, Nixon never submitted to questioning from F.B.I. investigators. But Nixon misrepresented or lied about his involvement in the Watergate cover-up to Justice Department officials and his own aides.\nMr. Mueller\u2019s investigators deemed Mr. Trump\u2019s written answers about Russia-related topics \u201cinadequate,\u201d but they did not accuse him of providing false information. Like Nixon, however, Mr. Trump did provide false information to potential witnesses, including his own aides. He has also refused to allow congressional committees access to relevant information, including the unredacted Mueller report and witnesses.\n* 3 approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counsellingencouraging witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings;\n* interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Forcethe office of the special counsel and congressional committees;\n* approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities;\n* endeavoring to misuse the Central Intelligence AgencyDepartment of Justice, an agency of the United States;\n* disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability;\n* making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the PresidentTrump 2016 campaign, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct; or\n* endeavoring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony or endeavoring to intimidate individuals who offered testimony.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.\nMost of the above charges against Nixon required only modest tweaks to match Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. Mr. Trump asked the Department of Justice, not the Central Intelligence Agency, to go after his political rivals. Mr. Trump\u2019s misconduct focused on covering up actions by members of his presidential campaign rather than the Committee for the Re-election of the President, a fundraising committee separate from the rest of the Nixon campaign apparatus.\nAn impeachment article against Mr. Trump could argue the president encouraged witnesses to give false or misleading statements to investigators and to the public, or focus on how Mr. Trump interfered with the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.\nArticle II\nUsing the powers of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purpose of these agencies.\nThis conduct has included one or more of the following:\n* He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavored to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner.\n* He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret ServiceDepartment of Justice, and other executive personnel in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance.\n* He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the president, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial.\n* He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavored to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National CommitteeRussian interference in the 2016 election, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as attorney general of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President.\n* In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nNixon\u2019s abuses of presidential power, the subject of his second article, were manifold. They involved pressuring federal agencies to punish or surveil his perceived political enemies. While much of this second article doesn\u2019t match what we know of Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct, Mr. Trump has undermined the purpose of the federal government by attacking the rule of law and calling for investigations of figures like Hillary Clinton and James Comey.\n\u201cThe spirit he\u2019s cultivating is that the federal bureaucracy only exists to serve the needs of Donald J. Trump,\u201d said Mr. Naftali, the historian.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct of the office of president of the United States, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974April 19, 2019, April 22, 2019, and May 21, 2019; the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019, and May 8, 2019; and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on May 10, 2019, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the president. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.\nIn all of this, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore, Richard M. NixonDonald J. Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.\nBased on Clinton\u2019s Impeachment\nThe first article of impeachment passed by the Republican-controlled House against Bill Clinton was based on testimony he gave before a federal grand jury. Because Mr. Trump refused an in-person interview with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators, did not agree to provide written answers to questions about obstruction and never testified before the grand jury, little of this first article is relevant to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct.\nResolved, That William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate:\nArticles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America, against William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, president of the United States of America, in maintenance and support of its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.\nArticle I\nIn his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his personal gain and exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that:\nOn Aug. 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before a federal grand jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William Jefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading testimony to the grand jury concerning one or more of the following: (1) the nature and details of his relationship with a subordinate government employee; (2) prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he gave in a federal civil rights action brought against him; (3) prior false and misleading statements he allowed his attorney to make to a federal judge in that civil rights action; and (4) his corrupt efforts to influence the testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of evidence in that civil rights action.The Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. Subsequent thereto, Donald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such Russian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\nIn doing this, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought disrepute on the presidency, has betrayed his trust as president and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\nBut any case for impeaching Mr. Trump would likely rest on obstruction of justice, the focus of Mr. Clinton\u2019s third article. (Republicans also drafted a second and fourth impeachment article against Mr. Clinton, but neither passed the full House.)\nWe\u2019ve re-ordered the obstruction charges arrayed against Mr. Clinton to better match the timeline of Mr. Trump\u2019s potentially obstructive acts. The quotations describing each of Mr. Trump\u2019s acts come from the redacted Mueller report.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct while president of the United States, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end engaged personally, and through his subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony related to a federal civil rights action brought against him in a duly instituted judicial proceedinginvestigation.\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or scheme included one or more of the following acts:\n* On or about Dec. 17, 1997Feb. 14, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly encouraged a witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himattempted to persuade the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to execute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, false and misleading.end the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into the national security adviser.\n* On or about Dec. 28, 1997, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that had been subpoenaed in alimit the scope of a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation, including by firing the F.B.I. director and attempting to get the attorney general to \u201cunrecuse\u201d himself from overseeing the special counsel investigation.\n* On or about Jan. 18 and Jan. 20-21, 1998June 17, 2017, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump related a false and misleading account of events relevant to a federal civil rights action brought against him to a potential witness in that proceeding,ordered the White House counsel to have the special counsel removed in order to corruptly influence the testimony of that witnesscourse of a federal investigation.\nThe obstruction case laid out against President Clinton was largely based on his behavior toward witnesses in the investigation into his conduct. As you can see from our rendering of a Trump indictment, Mr. Trump arguably took more extensive steps than Mr. Clinton did to thwart investigators. Beyond interfering with witnesses and encouraging the giving of false testimony, Mr. Trump tried to limit the scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation and have the special counsel removed.\n* 4On Jan. 17, 1998In January and February 2018, at his deposition in a federal civil rights action brought against him, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump corruptly allowedengaged in repeated efforts to get his attorneythe White House counsel to makecreate a false and misleading statements to a federal judgerecord characterizing an affidavitthe president\u2019s efforts to remove the special counsel, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the judge\u201cdeflect or prevent further scrutiny of the president\u2019s conduct towards the investigation.\u201d. Such a false and misleading statementsrecord were subsequently acknowledged by his attorneythe White House counsel in a communication to that judgethe office of the special counsel.\n* Beginning on or about Dec. 7, 1997, and continuing through and including Jan. 14, 1998in spring 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job assistance todiscuss pardons with a potential witness in a federal civil rights action brought against himinvestigation in order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been harmful to him.\n* On or about Jan. 21, 23 and 26, 1998In summer 2018, William Jefferson ClintonDonald J. Trump made false and misleading statements\u201cused inducements in the form of positive messages\u2026and then turned to attacks and intimidation\u201d totoward a potential witnesseswitness in a federal grand jury proceedinginvestigation in order to corruptly influence the testimony of those witnessesthat witness.

Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\nBelow you can see what articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump alone might look like. These rewritten articles against Mr. Trump don\u2019t include other potentially impeachable offenses that lack a clear precedent in the Nixon and Clinton cases, such as hush-money payments to women or possible violations of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause.\nAn impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is far from guaranteed. And whether impeaching him would politically help or hurt Democrats remains an open question. But there is no question that by the standards for high crimes and misdemeanors applied to past presidents in living memory, Donald J. Trump has committed impeachable offenses.\nTrump\u2019s impeachment\nArticle I\nThe Russian government engaged in a sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. On May 17, 2017, a special counsel was appointed to investigate Russian interference, including any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign. The special counsel was also given \u201cthe authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the special counsel\u2019s investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\u201d Subsequent thereto, Donald J. Trump, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede and obstruct the investigation of such Russian contacts and potential obstruction of justice; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\nThe means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following:\n* withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative employees of the United States, including congressional committees;\n* approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and encouraging witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings;\n* interfering or endeavoring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of the special counsel, and congressional committees;\n* endeavoring to misuse the Department of Justice, an agency of the United States;\n* making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Trump 2016 campaign, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct; or\n* endeavoring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony or endeavoring to intimidate individuals who offered testimony.\nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.\nArticle II\nUsing the powers of the office of president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purpose of these agencies.\nThis conduct has included one or more of the following:\n* He misused the Department of Justice, and other executive personnel, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office.\n* He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavoured to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the cover-up thereof.\n* In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Department of Justice, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nArticle III\nIn his conduct of the office of president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of president of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 19, 2019, April 22, 2019, and May 21, 2019; the Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019; the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives on April 15, 2019, and May 8, 2019; and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives on May 10, 2019, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the president. In refusing to produce these papers and things Donald J. Trump, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.\nIn all of this, Donald J. Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice, and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\nWherefore, Donald J. Trump by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Separated from the surrounding cotton fields and cattle pastures by a razor-wire fence, the station stood on the town\u2019s main road, near a feed store, the Good News Apostolic Church and La Indita Tortiller\u00eda. Most people around Clint had little idea of what went on inside. Agents came and went in pickup trucks; buses pulled into the gates with the occasional load of children apprehended at the border, four miles south.\nBut inside the secretive site that is now on the front lines of the southwest border crisis, the men and women who work there were grappling with the stuff of nightmares.\nOutbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children\u2019s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents\u2019 own clothing \u2014 people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.\nA Migrant Jail\nThis story was a collaboration between The New York Times and The El Paso Times.\n\u201cIt gets to a point where you start to become a robot,\u201d said a veteran Border Patrol agent who has worked at the Clint station since it was built. He described following orders to take beds away from children to make more space in holding cells, part of a daily routine that he said had become \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\nThe little-known Border Patrol facility at Clint has suddenly become the public face of the chaos on America\u2019s southern border, after immigration lawyers began reporting on the children they saw \u2014 some of them as young as 5 months old \u2014 and the filthy, overcrowded conditions in which they were being held.\nOverview\nThe main processing\ncenter held children\nin cinder-block cells.\nN\nA loading area\nwas converted to\nhouse older\nchildren in\nbunk beds.\nTexas\nClint\nPortable toilets\nand showers\nsat in an\nadjacent yard.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTents housed\ndetainees when the\ninflux was at its peak.\nChain-link fencing\ninside a warehouse\nseparated children\nand adults by gender.\nN\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTexas\nClint\nChildren were\nhoused in cells\nin the main\nprocessing\ncenter and in\na converted\nloading area.\nFencing\ninside a\nwarehouse\nseparated\ndetainees\nby gender.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nN\nTexAS\nClint\nFencing\ninside a\nwarehouse\nseparated\ndetainees\nby gender.\nChildren were\nhoused in cells\nin the main\nprocessing\ncenter and in\na converted\nloading area.\nN\nThe main processing\ncenter held children\nin cinder-block cells.\nTexas\nClint\nA loading area was\nconverted to house older\nchildren in bunk beds.\nPortable toilets and\nshowers sat in an\nadjacent yard.\nBorder Patrol Station\nClint, Texas\nTents housed\ndetainees when the\ninflux was at its peak.\nChain-link fencing inside a\nwarehouse separated children\nand adults by gender.\nBy The New York Times | Aerial image by Mario Tama/Getty Images\nBorder Patrol leaders, including Aaron Hull, the outspoken chief patrol agent of the agency\u2019s El Paso Sector, have disputed descriptions of degrading conditions inside Clint and other migrant detention sites around El Paso, claiming that their facilities were rigorously and humanely managed even after a spate of deaths of migrant children in federal custody.\nBut a review of the operations of the Clint station, near El Paso\u2019s eastern edge, shows that the agency\u2019s leadership knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry. Its own agents had raised the alarm, and found themselves having to accommodate even more new arrivals.\nThe accounts of what happened at Clint and at nearby border facilities are based on dozens of interviews by The New York Times and The El Paso Times of current and former Border Patrol agents and supervisors; lawyers, lawmakers and aides who visited the facility; and an immigrant father whose children were held there. The review also included sworn statements from those who spent time at El Paso border facilities, inspection reports and accounts from neighbors in Clint.\nThe conditions at Clint represent a conundrum not just for local officials, but for Congress, where lawmakers spent weeks battling over the terms of a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for facilities at the border. The lack of federal investment, some argue, is why the sites have been so strained. But the reports of squalor prompted several Democratic lawmakers to vote against the final bill, which did not have oversight and enforcement provisions.\nBy all accounts, the Border Patrol\u2019s attempt to continue making room for new children at Clint even as it was unable to find space to send them to better-equipped facilities was a source of concern for many people who worked there.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the number of times I would talk to agents and they would get teary-eyed,\u201d said one agent, a veteran of 13 years with Border Patrol who worked at Clint.\nMary E. Gonz\u00e1lez, a Democratic state lawmaker who toured the Clint station last week, said that Border Patrol agents told her they had repeatedly warned their superiors about the overcrowded facility, but that federal officials had taken no action.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We were ringing the alarms, we were ringing the alarms, and nobody was listening to us\u2019 \u2014 agents told me that,\u201d Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI genuinely believe that the higher-ups made the Clint situation happen.\u201d\nA Forward Operating Base\nArchitects designed the Clint station as a type of forward base \u2014 replete with fueling stations, garages for all-terrain vehicles and horse stables \u2014 from which agents could go on forays along the border.\nThe station was never intended to hold more than about a hundred adult men, and it was designed with the idea that migrants would be detained for only a few hours of processing before being transferred to other locations.\nOfficials have allowed reporters and members of Congress on controlled tours of Clint, but prohibited them from bringing phones or cameras inside, and from entering certain areas. But through interviews with dozens of people with knowledge of the station \u2014 including lawyers, former detainees and staff members \u2014 The Times was able to model the main areas where children were held: the station\u2019s central processing area, with its cinder-block cells; a converted loading area and yard; and a warehouse on the property.\nProcessing Center\nProcessing Center\nChildren and toddlers were held for days in cinder-block cells with a single toilet.

Photographs in the hallway celebrate the work of the Border Patrol, showing agents on horseback and in all-terrain vehicles. A conference room features high-backed chairs upholstered with faux leather.\nBut the sense of normalcy fades away the deeper one goes into the station. A detachment of Coast Guard personnel, sent to assist overworked agents, stock an ad hoc pantry with items like oatmeal and instant noodles. Monitors in blue shirts roam the station, hired through an outside contractor to supervise the detained children.\nBeyond the pantry, a door leads to the site\u2019s processing center, equipped with about 10 cells. One day this month, about 20 girls were crowded into one cell, so packed that some were sprawled on the floor. Toddlers could be seen in some cells, cared for by older children.\nOne of the cells functioned as a quarantine unit or \u201cflu cell\u201d for children with contagious diseases; employees have at times worn medical masks and gloves to protect themselves.\nA part of the processing area was set aside for detained children to make phone calls to family members. Many broke into tears upon hearing the voices of loved ones, episodes so common that some agents merely shrugged in response.\nLoading Area and Yard\nLOADING AREA\nAnd Yard\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nClint border\npatrol station\nLoading area\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nTrailer with showers\nBasketball hoop\nYard\nSleeping mats\nPortable\ntoilets\n10 feet\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nLoading area\nTrailer with showers\nBasketball hoop\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nYard\nSleeping mats\n10 feet\nPortable\ntoilets\nLoading Area and Yard\nOlder children slept in a converted loading area, with access to a fenced yard and a single basketball hoop for recreation.\nThree-bed bunk beds lined one wall.\nStorage for food and toiletries.\nFan\nTrailer with showers\nSleeping mats\n10 feet\nPortable\ntoilets\nBasketball hoop\nClint is known for holding what agents call U.A.C.s, or unaccompanied alien children \u2014 children who cross the border alone or with relatives who are not their parents.\nThree agents who work at Clint said they had seen unaccompanied children as young as 3 enter the facility, and lawyers who recently inspected the site as part of a lawsuit on migrant children\u2019s rights said they saw children as young as 5 months old. An agent who has worked for Border Patrol for 13 years \u2014 and who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation \u2014 confirmed reports by immigration lawyers that agents have asked migrants who are teenagers to help care for the younger children.\n\u201cWe have nine agents processing, two agents in charge of U.A.C. care and we have little ones that need their diapers changed, and we can\u2019t do that,\u201d the agent said. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry them or change diapers. We do ask the older juveniles, the 16-year-olds or 17-year-olds, to help us out with that.\u201d\nWarehouse\nTrailer with\nshowers\nWarehouse\nA tin-roof building that is used to store patrol vehicles was converted to hold families.

The number of children in the site is thought to have peaked at more than 700 around April and May, and stood at nearly 250 two weeks ago. In an attempt to relieve overcrowding, agents took all the children out of Clint but then moved more than 100 back into the station just days later.\nUnaccompanied boys are kept in a converted loading area that holds about 50 people. Until a few weeks ago, older boys were kept in a tent encampment outside.\nFamilies, including adult parents, were also sent to Clint earlier this year, and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes Clint, said that 11 adult males \u201capprehended that morning\u201d were also being held at the site when he visited on June 29.\nBefore the influx of migrants began to wane in recent weeks, the agents said they had kept the families in a warehouse normally used to house A.T.V.s. It was converted into two holding areas initially intended to house 50 people each.\nA Chief Agent Under Fire\nAt least two Border Patrol agents at Clint said they had expressed concern about the conditions in the station to their superiors months ago. Even before that, senior Homeland Security officials in Washington had significant concerns about the El Paso Sector\u2019s brash chief patrol agent and his oversight of the facility over the past year, when tighter security along other sections of the border prompted a steep rise in migrant crossings along the section that runs from New Mexico through West Texas.\nThe situation became so severe that in January, officials at Customs and Border Protection, the agency that oversees the Border Patrol, took the unusual move of ordering the sector chief, Mr. Hull, to come to headquarters in Washington for a face-to-face meeting. The officials were concerned that Mr. Hull, an agency veteran who speaks with a pronounced Texas twang, had moved too slowly to put safety measures in place after the deaths of migrant children, according to a Homeland Security official. After the meeting, Mr. Hull moved forward with the new procedures.\nBut tension has persisted between Mr. Hull and officials in Washington, particularly in recent months, as the number of migrants continued to increase at his facilities. The officials believe that Mr. Hull and Matthew Harris, the chief of the Clint station, have been slow to follow directives and communicate developments at the facilities in their sector, according to two Homeland Security officials.\nMr. Hull is seen as a hard-liner on immigration issues. He has often been heard saying that migrants exaggerate the problems they face in their home countries.\nOfficials at the border agency declined multiple interview requests.\nLast month, the acting head of C.B.P., John Sanders, ordered an internal investigation into the Clint facility. The investigation \u2014 which is being conducted by the agency\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and the department\u2019s inspector general \u2014 has examined allegations of misconduct.\nAs part of the review, investigators have conducted interviews and watched hours of video footage to see how agents treated detainees. So far, investigators have found little evidence to substantiate allegations of misconduct. But they have found that the facility is several times over capacity and has horrendous conditions.\nThe uproar over the site is drawing scrutiny on Border Patrol facilities that are some of the least-regulated migrant detention centers in the United States.\nThat is in part because they are intended in most cases to hold migrants for no more than 72 hours, before they are turned over to better-equipped facilities operated by other government agencies with stricter regulations on, say, the number of toilets and showers required. But the 72-hour limit has been frequently breached during the current migrant surge; some children have been housed at Clint for weeks on end.\nLawyers who visited the Clint station described children in filthy clothes, often lacking diapers and with no access to toothbrushes, toothpaste or soap, prompting people around the country to donate supplies that the Border Patrol turned away.\nBut Mr. Hull painted a far different picture of his need for supplies in April, when the numbers of children held in Clint were soaring. Mr. Hull told commissioners in Do\u00f1a Ana County in Las Cruces, N.M., in April that his stations had more than enough supplies.\n\u201cTwenty years ago, we were lucky if we had juice and crackers for those in custody,\u201d Mr. Hull said, as quoted in The Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cNow, our stations are looking more like Walmarts \u2014 with diapers and baby formula and all kinds of things, like food and snacks, that we aren\u2019t resourced or staffed for and don\u2019t have the space to hold.\u201d\nAn Inspector Arrives\nOne day in April, a man from Washington arrived unannounced around midday at the Clint station. He introduced himself as Henry Moak, and told the agents inside that he was there to inspect the site in his role as Customs and Border Protection\u2019s chief accountability officer.\nThe Clint station was far over capacity on the day of Mr. Moak\u2019s visit, bulging with 291 children. Mr. Moak found evidence of a lice infestation; children also told him about going hungry and being forced to sleep on the floors.\nOne girl, a 14-year-old from El Salvador, had been in custody for 14 days in Clint, including a nine-day stretch in a nearby hospital during which Border Patrol agents accompanied her and kept her under surveillance. Mr. Moak did not specify in his report why the girl had been rushed to the hospital. When the girl returned to Clint, another child had taken her bed so she had to sleep on the floor.\nTwo sisters from Honduras, one 11 and the other 7, told Mr. Moak that they had to sleep on benches in the facility\u2019s hold room, getting their own cot only when other children were transferred out. \u201cThe sisters told me they had not showered or brushed their teeth since arriving at Clint station,\u201d Mr. Moak said in his report. Showers had been offered twice during the girls\u2019 time in custody, but the girls were asleep each time, his review showed.\nMr. Moak in the end stated that Clint was in compliance with standards.\nOne of a team of lawyers who inspected the station in June, Warren Binford, director of the clinical law program at Willamette University in Oregon, said that in all her years of visiting detention and shelter facilities, she had never encountered conditions so bad \u2014 351 children crammed into what she described as a prisonlike environment.\nShe looked at the roster, and was shocked to see more than 100 very young children listed. \u201cMy God, these are babies, I realized. They are keeping babies here,\u201d she recalled.\nOne teenage mother from El Salvador said Border Patrol agents at the border had taken her medicine for her infant son, who had a fever.\n\u201cDid they throw away anything else?\u201d Ms. Binford said she had asked her.\n\u201cEverything,\u201d she replied. \u201cThey threw away my baby\u2019s diapers, formula, bottle, baby food and clothes. They threw away everything.\u201d\nOnce at Clint, she told Ms. Binford, the baby\u2019s fever came back and she begged the agents for more medicine. \u201cWho told you to come to America with your baby, anyway?\u201d one of the agents told her, according to the young woman\u2019s account to Ms. Binford.\nBorder Patrol agents have said they have adequate supplies at Clint for most of the migrants\u2019 needs. The facility lacks a kitchen, they said, so the ramen, granola bars, instant oatmeal and burritos that serve as most of the sustenance for migrants has been the best they could do.\nChildren sometimes could be seen crying, said one Border Patrol agent, who has worked for seven years at the Clint facility, but it most often seemed to be because they missed their parents. \u201cIt\u2019s never because they\u2019re mistreated; it\u2019s because they\u2019re homesick,\u201d she said.\nA Father Finds His Sons\nNot long after Mr. Moak signed off on the conditions inside Clint, a man named Ruben was desperately trying to find his sons, 11-year-old twins who both have epilepsy.\nThe boys had crossed the border together in early June with their adult sister. They were hoping to reunite with their parents who had come to the United States earlier from El Salvador in order to earn enough money to pay for the boys\u2019 epilepsy medications. They require daily injections and a strict regimen of care to prevent the seizures they began having at age 5.\nBut the twins were separated at the border from their sister and sent to Clint.\nThe first time they spoke to Ruben on the phone, the two boys sobbed intensely and asked when they would be able to see their parents again.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d they told him.\nRuben asked that his last name and the names of his sons be withheld for fear of retaliation by the American government.\nOnly later did Ruben learn that the boys had been given at least some of their epilepsy medication, and neither one had had a seizure. But one boy reported breaking out in a skin rash, his face and arms turning red and flaky. Both had come down with fevers and said they had been sent temporarily to the \u201cflu cell.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no one to take care of you there,\u201d one told his father.\nIt took 13 days after the boys were detained to speak to their father over the phone. A lawyer who had entered the facility, Clara Long of Human Rights Watch, met the boys, tracked down their parents, and helped them make a call. The boys were stoic and quiet, she said, and shook her hand as if \u201ctrying to act like little adults\u201d \u2014 until they spoke to their father. Then, they could answer only with one- or two-word answers, Ms. Long said, and were wiping tears from their faces.\nMuch of the overcrowding appears to have been relieved at Clint, and overall arrivals at the border are slowing, as new policies make migrants, mainly from Central America, return to Mexico after they request asylum, as the summer heat deters travelers and as Mexico\u2019s crackdown on its southern border prevents many from entering.\nA Border Patrol agent who has long worked in the El Paso area said agents had tried to make things as easy as possible for the children; some bought toys and sports equipment on their own to bring in. \u201cAgents play board games and sports with them,\u201d he said.\nBut the Border Patrol long \u201ctook great pride\u201d in quickly processing migrant families, and making sure children did not remain in their rudimentary stations for longer than 72 hours, the agent said. Clint, he said, \u201cis not a place for kids.\u201d\nIn the surrounding town, many residents were puzzled and sad at the news of what was happening to children in the station on Alameda Avenue.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell happened, but they\u2019ve diverted from their original mission,\u201d said Juli\u00e1n Molinar, 66, a retired postal deliveryman who lives in a house facing the station. He served in the Army in Europe as the Berlin Wall came down, he said, and was dismayed that there was now talk of building a border wall near his home. As for the Clint facility, he said, \u201cchildren should not be held here.\u201d\nDora H. Aguirre, Clint\u2019s mayor, expressed sympathy for the agents, who are part of the community in Clint and neighboring El Paso. \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to do their job as a federal agency,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are trying to do the best they can.\u201d\nSimon Romero, Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Manny Fernandez and Caitlin Dickerson reported for The New York Times, and Daniel Borunda and Aaron Montes reported for The El Paso Times.

CF LT ******** IS THE PLATOON LEADER. THE RECON WAS ALONG A KNOWN ROUTE WHICH LT \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 HAD TRAVELED FREQUENTLY AND ESTABLISHED CHECKPOINTS ALONG THIS ROUTE. PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL. HE AND THE IA SQUAD WERE 200M AHEAD OF PATROL MAIN BODY. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 IDENTIFIED THIS POINT AS A FREQUENT CROSSING POINT. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 IDENTIFIED 2 IRANIANS RUN FROM THE VICINITY OF THIS LOCATION BACK TO IRANIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER.\nTHE PATROL SCANNED THE AREA WITH THEIR LRAS. WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS, THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA) NEEDED TO GO. WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK HE SENT HIS INTERPRETER, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (A TITAN LOCAL NATIONAL HIRED FROM FOB CALDWELL) TO GO FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT THEY ALL NEEDED TO DEPART. THE INTERPRETER DID SO, BUT RETURNED TO CF LT ********* TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK AND THE IRANIANS WANTED TO HAVE A MEETING TO TALK ABOUT THE BORDER. CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS. THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION. THEY DID NOT MENTION THE INTERPRETER, NOR A FIFTH IA SOLDIER. WE HAVE SUBMITTED AN RTQ TO THE CORPS PAO, AND RECOMMEND RELEASING TO TRY GETTING OUT AHEAD OF ANY IRANIAN CLAIMS OF CROSSING THE BORDER (EXASPERATED BY US KILLING ONE OF THEIR SOLDIERS).\nAS OF 081800D: MNC-I STILL CONSIDERS THE 7 PERSONNEL DUSTWUN UNTIL WE HAVE PROOF OF THEIR STATUS.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ. 1 X LN, 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP-North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP. IA (at the mirror CP) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP, the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE. \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS, THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS. THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ. 1 X LN, 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP-North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP. IA (at the mirror CP) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP, the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nREF:BAGSTAT\nDOI:22 DEC 06\nTITLE: ALLEGED JAYSH AL-MAHDI PLANS TO KIDNAP U.S. SOLDIERS IN BAGHDAD, IRAQ\nAS OF EARLY DECEMBER 2006, JAYSH AL-MAHDI ALLEGELY PLANNED TO ATTACK U.

PLTS TASK AND PURPOSE WAS TO CONDUCT A ZONE/ROUTE RECON AS JOINT OPERATION WITH IA AND DBE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY KEY INFILTRATION ROUTES INTO IRAQ AND TO ASSESS THE C2 CAPABILITY AND COOPERATION BETWEEN THE IA & DBE . \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RODE IN THE LEAD IA TRUCK WITH THE IA SQUAD, WHILE \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, THE IA SQD LEADER, ROAD IN A PLT VEHICLE.\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO CF LT ********* WERE AS FOLLOWS: USE MAIN ROADS TO GET TO CASTLE ACCESS ROADS; THE DBE CASTLES ALONG THE BORDER. NO CROSS COUNTRY MOVEMENT FROM CASTLE TO CASTLE WAS AUTHORIZED DUE TO MINEFIELD DANGERS. THEY WERE ALSO TO NOT TO COME WITHIN 1KM OF BORDER. PATROL USED BFT AND GPS TO CONFIRM THEIR LOCATION AT ALL TIMES. FOCUS WAS NOT THE IRANIANS THEMSELVES BUT INFILTRATION ROUTES AND THE MOVEMENT OF ACCELERANTS. ALL ACKNOWLEDGED SPECIAL SENSITIVITIES AROUND THE BORDER DUE TO UN SANCTIONS AND IRANIAN CONCERN THAT US WAS ATTEMPTING TO MOUNT AN INVASION. THEY ALSO NOTED A PREVIOUS ARTICLE ABOUT BRITISH WHO ALSO MOVED FORCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN IRANIAN BORDER.\nAS THE PATROL APPROACHED THE IRAQI BORDER, \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013, IN THE LEAD VEHICLE, STOPPED THE PATROL.

WHILE MOVING FORWARD TO THE IA VEHICLE AHEAD, AN ARMED IRANIAN SOLDIER RIDING A MOTORCYCLE APPROACHED THE IA VEHICLE. THAT THIS POINT THE IRAQI LEAD VEHICLE WAS 75M AHEAD OF US MAIN BODY. THE IA SOLDIERS STOPPED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DISMOUNTED THEIR TRUCK AND WALKED APPROX 100M TO THE FRONT OF THEIR VEHICLE TO TALK TO IRANIAN SOLDIER.\nWITH THEIR LRAS , THE PATROL SCANNED THE IRANIAN BORDER CASTLE APPROX 2200-2500M AWAY AND IDENTIFIED A FIGHTING POSITION WEST OF THE CASTLE CONTAINING 2 X T62S AND A DSKA. WITHIN APPROX. 2 MINUTES OF THE IA STOPPING THE MOTORCYCLE, TWO IRANIAN TRUCKS MOVED SOUTH DOWN THE WINDING ROAD FROM THE CASTLE AND 8 SOLDIERS DISMOUNTED EACH TRUCK (16 TOTAL). THE IRANIANS STARTED TO TALK TO THE IA PATROL, DRAWING THE SQUAD AWAY FROM THEIR VEHICLE, APPARENTLY TO SEPARATE THE TWO IN ORDER TO DENY THEIR ABILITY TO LEAVE EXPEDITIOUSLY. AN IRANIAN BORDER CAPTAIN LINKED UP WITH THE IA ELEMENT AT THE LEAD OF THE COLUMN, CLAIMING TO WANT TO DISCUSS BORDER CROSSING PROBLEMS. THE 2 GROUPS OF 8 IRANIAN SOLDIERS IMT D AND TOOK UP TACTICAL POSITIONS NORTH OF THE COLUMN ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE IRANIAN SOLDIERS WERE ARMED WITH SMALL ARMS WEAPONS.\nCF LT *********** CALLED HIS LEAD TRUCK (100M TO HIS FRONT) TELLING THE SQUAD LEADER TO MOTION TO THE IA THAT THEY (THE IA ) NEEDED TO GO.

CF LT ************ MOVED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH TO SEE THE IA ALL OFF THEIR TRUCK, GUN UNMANNED, WITH THEIR GEAR OFF, SHOWING PICTURES TO IRANIAN SOLDIERS AND HAVING TEA WITH THE IRANIANS.\nCF LT ********* HAD THE INTERPRETER ONCE AGAIN TELL THE IA THAT THEY MUST LOAD UP AND GO. TWO MORE IRANIAN TRUCKS APPEARED AND 8 SOLDIERS EACH (16 TOTAL) DISMOUNTED AND TACTICALLY MANEUVERED INTO TACTICAL POSITIONS FURTHER SOUTH ON THE DIRECT EAST AND WEST SIDES OF CF LT ************** PLATOON COLUMN. WEAPONS CARRIED WERE AK47S, RPKS AND RPGS . THE IRANIANS WERE CLEARLY INTENT UPON ENCIRCLING THE PATROL.\nCF LT *********** HAD HIS PLT START TO SLOWLY BACK THEIR TRUCKS UP (SOUTH). AT THIS POINT, \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 (INTERPRETER) WENT RUNNING BACK FROM THE LEAD POSITION TELLING CF LT ******* NOT TO MOVE OR THE IRANIANS WOULD ENGAGE THE COLUMN. CF LT *********** HELD HIS GUYS AND THEN MOVED FORWARD TO TRY AND MOTION THE IA TO GET IN THEIR TRUCK AND GO. HE THEN HAD \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO TELL THE IA THAT HE WAS LOW ON GAS AND MUST RETURN. \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 RETURNED AND SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS OK - THE IRANIANS SAID THEY WOULD GIVE THEM GAS AND WANTED TO CONTINUE THE MEETING. CF LT ********** THEN TOLD HIS GUYS THEY WERE LEAVING.\nTHE IRANIANS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE COLUMN STARTED TO ENGAGE THE PATROL BEFORE CF LT ********** TRUCKS MOVED. CF LT ********* GAVE THE COMMAND TO RETURN FIRE AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE CHECK POINT 14 (VIC NC 627243). THE ENTIRE COLUMN WAS UNDER FIRE AND RETURNED FIRE AS THEY CONDUCTED U-TURNS TO LEAVE THE AREA. AN RPG GUNNER WHO HAD MOVED TO THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COLUMN AND WAS ON THE ROAD TRYING TO ENGAGE CF LT *********** PLT WAS ENGAGED AND KILLED BY A .50 CAL GUNNER. WHILE BREAKING CONTACT AND RETURNING TO CP14, THE PLT RECEIVED RPG AND INDIRECT FIRE ALL THE WAY BACK TO CP 14 - WELL INSIDE IRAQI TERRITORY AND WEST OF THE BORDER CASTLE. THE ENTIRE ENGAGEMENT LASTED 1:30 TO 2:00 MINUTES. AS THE PLT BROKE CONTACT - IRANIAN INDIRECT FIRE LANDED AROUND THEM FOR APPROX 5:00 MINUTES. TOTAL NUMBER OF IRANIAN CASUALTIES IS UNKNOWN, MINUS THE RPG GUNNER WHO WAS KILLED IN THE .50 CAL ENGAGEMENT.\nUPON ARRIVAL AT CP14, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE IA SOLDIERS HAD NOT FOLLOWED. WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE IA ATTEMPTED TO REMOUNT THEIR VEHICLE OR NOT. PROBABLY NOT THOUGH, AS THE IRANIANS APPEAR TO HAVE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED THEM FROM THEIR VEHICLE. THROUGHOUT THE DAY WE CONTINUED TO TRY TO REESTABLISH OBSERVATION OF THE IA SOLDIERS, VIA GROUND SURVEILLANCE, SHADOW UAV AND GLOBAL HAWK, TO NO AVAIL.\nCOL ********** CDR 3/4ID, RECEIVED WORD THIS EVENING FROM THE MANDALI POE JCC THAT THE IRANIANS HAVE INFORMED THEM THEY HAVE 4 IA SOLDIERS AND A DBE LT IN DETENTION.

The leadership in Iran benefits as it focuses the Iranian population on a perceived external threat rather than internal dissension. Kurdish leaders remain concerned about international perceptions regarding security as they seek to increase investment in the KRG. Expect KRG leadership to intervene to return the 3 individuals and the Iranian government to accuse them of being spies. Additionally, KRG leadership may impose additional restrictions on private activities near the Iranian border.\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED///(311418JUL09)\nMND-B EVENT:20090809034738SMB44808480\nWHO: JASG-C Admin\nWHAT: CRIMINAL EVENT- MURDER\nWHERE: 38S MB 44808480 (RTI COMPOUND)\nWHEN: 090347AUG09\nHOW: 3 PERSONNEL FOR ARMOR GROUP WERE SHOT IN THE WERE SHOT IN THE IZ . 1 X LN , 1 X BRITISH, 1 X AUSTRAILIAN, ALL EMPLOYED BY ARMOR GROUP (DOD CONTRACTOR).

KRG perceive this action to be a challenge to the Kurdish Government. At 081131MAY09, KRG LNO to CP -North informed the DCG-S of MND-N (BG \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) that if the PGOV traveled into Kurdish controlled area, there would be a potential incident. MNC-I KRG LNO (\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) received this report from KDP Assayish: if Najafi travels into Kurdish territory, the Peshmerga will stop him with force if necessary. Ninewa PRT (\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013) contacted Najafi via phone to warn him of possible danger, but Najafi insisted on going anyway. 3/1 CAV moved forces to the Farmhouse Checkpoint (the first Peshmerga checkpoint on the road to Bashiqa) to monitor the situation. The Peshmerga at the checkpoint reported that they are ordered to shoot Najafi if he attempts to pass through the CP . IA (at the mirror CP ) reported that they are ordered to fire on Peshmerga if they fire on Najafi. The Ninewah Operations Center reported that PM Maliki ordered the NOC not to assist in securing PGOVs movement. IPs secured his movement anyway, under orders of MOI Ayden. Before Najafi arrived at the CP , the sports event in Bashiqa was cancelled. GOV Najafi moves to Hamdaniya instead, supposedly after hearing the event was cancelled.\nS2 Assessment: Recent reporting illustrates increased potential for ethnic tensions within Ninewa as a direct result of Provincial Governor Athil Najafi's actions. On 08 May, Najafi attempted to visit Bartella, a largely Christian town with a KRG office in the disputed sub-district of Ba'sheqa, Hamdaniyah district; the area is considered Kurd controlled, and there are Peshmerga checkpoints along the periphery of area. When Najafi arrived in the area with his entourage, Peshmerga elements were reinforced from Irbil in preparation for potential confrontation. It is highly likely that Najafi was aware of the contention that such a visit would bring, and it is assessed that this visit was likely intentionally staged to make a statement of governmental ownership of the region.\nIO Assessment: Increasing tensions between the Arabs and Kurds have been expected and this may be the first incident to elevate this tension to a higher level. PSYOP Detachment 1280 has been informed and aggressively pursuing viable products to prepare for future incidents. We will continue to monitor local media as well as task IQATF to monitor populace atmospherics, \"word on the street\" and Mosque prayers for possible rise in Arab-Kurd rhetoric. In addition 3-1 CAV IO will work with DIV IO to develop assessment and preparations for possible Talking Points.\nPAO Assessment: Will do release\nBDA: None\nMEETS MNC-I CCIR #5\n///CLOSED/// 131403CMAY09\nSummaryThis document described a plot by Azhar al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi Shiite militia commander, to kidnap American soldiers in Baghdad. The report asserts that he was chosen for this mission because of his training in Iran. The next month, an abortive effort to kidnap American troops in Karbala resulted in the deaths of the four soldiers who were seized. An American spokesman said that Mr. Dulaimi\u2019s fingerprints were found on the getaway car.\nSummaryThis report asserts that Iranian agents were encouraging attacks against Iraqi officials during the American military buildup in Baghdad in 2007.\nSummaryThis documents recounts the seizure of some explosively formed penetrators, the most deadly type of roadside bomb, that were being smuggled from Iran into Iraq, which was a chronic problem.\nSummaryThe field reports assert that Iran trained Iraqi militants in the use of explosive and as snipers.\nSummaryDiaries recovered from hidden weapons caches offer details about the training received by Iraqi militants in Iran.\nSummaryMortar and rocket attacks against the Green Zone continued during the first year of the Obama administration. These are ascribed to the Baghdad branch of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi Shiite militant organization backed by Iran.\nSummaryThe report indicates that American and Iraqi raids against people suspected of being Iranian agents continued during the Obama administration. This raid was carried out by an Iraqi SWAT police unit in Basra with the help of American Special Operations forces.\nSummaryThis document describes a firefight between American and Iranian forces near Iraq's border with Iran. An American platoon accompanied Iraqi soldiers on a search for infiltration routes. The Americans soldiers were instructed to stay at least one kilometer away from the border. The report asserts that an Iranian with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher threatened the American troops, prompting an American soldier to shoot him with a .50-caliber machine gun.\nSummaryThis report describes an episode during which an Apache helicopter is supporting troops on the ground who are taking fire from insurgents. The helicopter fires at them, and as many as 12 militants and 14 civilians are said to have been killed, though it was not clear from the report whether the bodies were counted twice.\nSummaryThis report states that two men believed to have been firing mortars tried to surrender to an Apache helicopter crew. A military lawyer says they are not allowed to surrender to an aircraft. The helicopter fires a missile at the two men, killing them.\nSummaryConfused encounters at checkpoints were often lethal for Iraqis. This report recounts a case in which an Iraqi family driving near a checkpoint kept moving even after Marines fired a flare, prompting the Marines to shoot. The mother was killed, and the father and three daughters were wounded.\nSummaryIf the war was dangerous for Americans, it was far worse for the Iraqis who worked for them. One Iraqi interpreter was killed by an American sniper from his own unit, who mistook him for a militant when the Iraqi became separated from his platoon.\nSummaryThe documents in the archive provide extensive accounts of Iraqi security forces abusing Iraqi prisoners. In this account, an American sergeant documented a case of prisoner abuse in a statement and reported it. It was not clear whether it was followed up. The report follows the standard script in stating that no investigation was started.\nSummaryAt times, American forces were able to intervene to stop the abuse of prisoners. In this case, from May 2005, a detainee reports that \u201cwhen the Marines finally took him, he was treated very well and he was thankful and happy to see them.\u201d\nSummaryThe archive disclosed by WikiLeaks documents hundreds of cases in which Iraqi police officers or soldiers were involved in prisoner abuse. In this case, American soldiers found 173 Iraqis detained by the police, many bearing bruises, sores and burns from cigarettes.\nSummaryThough the documents show clear evidence of prisoner abuse by Iraqis, they also show that such cases were often uninvestigated. In this case, the report explains that because no coalition forces are involved, \u201cno further investigation is necessary.\u201d\nSummaryIran has said that the three American hikers it detained in July 2009 crossed into Iran from Iraq. This report conveys the initial assessment that they were detained by Iranian forces on the Iraqi side of the border.\nSummaryContractors in Iraq were faced with threats from many quarters. In this case, an employee of Armor Group is reported to have shot and killed two co-workers as a result of an altercation. After a wild attempt to escape, a coalition soldier tackled him.\nSummaryThe archive shows many incidents in which contractors drew friendly fire from American troops or the Iraqi Army. In this case, the driver of an unmarked BMW, later identified as a contractor, was shot in a friendly fire incident.\nSummaryThe reports in the archive clearly document the ways in which contractors\u2019 actions contributed to scenes of chaos and violence. This report describes how a driver from Triple Canopy tried to bump a civilian\u2019s car out of its lane, creating a chain of events that resulted in the contractors\u2019 throwing a grenade at one of their own vehicles, possibly to prevent it from being used by insurgents.\nSummaryMany documents show that contractors shot with little discrimination at unarmed civilians. In May 2006, witnesses said that an Iraqi ambulance driver was killed by \u201cuncontrolled small arms firing\u201d after a vehicle owned by the Blackwater security company was hit by an improvised explosive device.\nSummaryImproper actions by contractors were seldom disciplined by American officials. In this case, killings of two civilians by Blackwater employees prompted immediate demonstrations by local Iraqis.\nSummaryAs early as 2005, sectarian killings began to increase, reaching a fever pitch in December 2006. This report raises the suspicion that an Iraqi may have been killed for working for the Americans, a major reason for killings in 2005.\nSummaryThe documents show that by the end of 2006, Iraq had descended into near chaos. This report, dated Dec. 20, 2006, provides details about 28 corpses found throughout Baghdad on a single day, each shot in the head. The report was one of many filed on a day during which at least 168 bodies were found throughout Iraq.\nSummaryAnother instance of prisoner abuse by the Iraqi police. In this case, American troops found evidence of \u201cunchecked torture,\u201d including a wooden pallet and a rubber hose, implements that were often used to beat detainees on their backs and the soles of their feet. Unlike in other cases, in this case Americans officers took action, including ordering a soldier to spend the night in the prison to prevent further abuses.\nSummaryThe prisons were also a site of sectarian violence. In this case, a group of Iraqis used false documents to take 12 detainees from an Iraqi prison on the same day that one of Iraq\u2019s most revered Shiite shrines, the Golden Mosque in Samarra, was bombed. The bombing set off sectarian fury across the country. The prisoners in this report, all Sunnis, were later found dead or critically wounded.\nSummaryA number of reports indicate that militants set up false checkpoints as a way of carrying out sectarian attacks. This report states that seven Iraqi civilians, including a 12-year-old boy, were found dead near one such checkpoint.\nSummaryIn this case, 12 civilians were found dead with their eyes cut out. The 12 had apparently been detained earlier by an Iraqi commando unit.\nSummaryThis report notes that American military and civilian officials played an important behind the scenes role in heading off a confrontation between the Sunni Arab governor of Nineveh Province and Kurdish forces. The episode began when the governor announced plans to attend a sports festival in a heavily Kurdish area. Episodes like these raise the question of what will happen when American forces are withdrawn from Iraq.\nAbout the Redactions\nThe types of information that have been removed from the documents include:\n- Names or precise identifying information of sources.\n- Names of buildings under surveillance.\n- Names of prisoners.\n- Names of kidnap victims.\n- Times required for various tactical military reactions.\n- Radio frequencies or phone numbers used in insurgent communications.\nNames of public figures (generals, prominent police officials, governors, warlords and senior afghan officials) have not been not redacted, though on a case-by-case basis, the names of lower-level employees have been removed.

You Can Trace That to the Plantation.\nIn order to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation.\nA couple of years before he was convicted of securities fraud, Martin Shkreli was the chief executive of a pharmaceutical company that acquired the rights to Daraprim, a lifesaving antiparasitic drug. Previously the drug cost $13.50 a pill, but in Shkreli\u2019s hands, the price quickly increased by a factor of 56, to $750 a pill. At a health care conference, Shkreli told the audience that he should have raised the price even higher. \u201cNo one wants to say it, no one\u2019s proud of it,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut this is a capitalist society, a capitalist system and capitalist rules.\u201d\nThis is a capitalist society. It\u2019s a fatalistic mantra that seems to get repeated to anyone who questions why America can\u2019t be more fair or equal. But around the world, there are many types of capitalist societies, ranging from liberating to exploitative, protective to abusive, democratic to unregulated. When Americans declare that \u201cwe live in a capitalist society\u201d \u2014 as a real estate mogul told The Miami Herald last year when explaining his feelings about small-business owners being evicted from their Little Haiti storefronts \u2014 what they\u2019re often defending is our nation\u2019s peculiarly brutal economy. \u201cLow-road capitalism,\u201d the University of Wisconsin-Madison sociologist Joel Rogers has called it. In a capitalist society that goes low, wages are depressed as businesses compete over the price, not the quality, of goods; so-called unskilled workers are typically incentivized through punishments, not promotions; inequality reigns and poverty spreads. In the United States, the richest 1 percent of Americans own 40 percent of the country\u2019s wealth, while a larger share of working-age people (18-65) live in poverty than in any other nation belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (O.E.C.D.).\nOr consider worker rights in different capitalist nations. In Iceland, 90 percent of wage and salaried workers belong to trade unions authorized to fight for living wages and fair working conditions. Thirty-four percent of Italian workers are unionized, as are 26 percent of Canadian workers. Only 10 percent of American wage and salaried workers carry union cards. The O.E.C.D. scores nations along a number of indicators, such as how countries regulate temporary work arrangements. Scores run from 5 (\u201cvery strict\u201d) to 1 (\u201cvery loose\u201d). Brazil scores 4.1 and Thailand, 3.7, signaling toothy regulations on temp work. Further down the list are Norway (3.4), India (2.5) and Japan (1.3). The United States scored 0.3, tied for second to last place with Malaysia. How easy is it to fire workers? Countries like Indonesia (4.1) and Portugal (3) have strong rules about severance pay and reasons for dismissal. Those rules relax somewhat in places like Denmark (2.1) and Mexico (1.9). They virtually disappear in the United States, ranked dead last out of 71 nations with a score of 0.5.\nThose searching for reasons the American economy is uniquely severe and unbridled have found answers in many places (religion, politics, culture). But recently, historians have pointed persuasively to the gnatty fields of Georgia and Alabama, to the cotton houses and slave auction blocks, as the birthplace of America\u2019s low-road approach to capitalism.\nSlavery was undeniably a font of phenomenal wealth. By the eve of the Civil War, the Mississippi Valley was home to more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the United States. Cotton grown and picked by enslaved workers was the nation\u2019s most valuable export. The combined value of enslaved people exceeded that of all the railroads and factories in the nation. New Orleans boasted a denser concentration of banking capital than New York City. What made the cotton economy boom in the United States, and not in all the other far-flung parts of the world with climates and soil suitable to the crop, was our nation\u2019s unflinching willingness to use violence on nonwhite people and to exert its will on seemingly endless supplies of land and labor. Given the choice between modernity and barbarism, prosperity and poverty, lawfulness and cruelty, democracy and totalitarianism, America chose all of the above.\nNearly two average American lifetimes (79 years) have passed since the end of slavery, only two. It is not surprising that we can still feel the looming presence of this institution, which helped turn a poor, fledgling nation into a financial colossus. The surprising bit has to do with the many eerily specific ways slavery can still be felt in our economic life. \u201cAmerican slavery is necessarily imprinted on the DNA of American capitalism,\u201d write the historians Sven Beckert and Seth Rockman. The task now, they argue, is \u201ccataloging the dominant and recessive traits\u201d that have been passed down to us, tracing the unsettling and often unrecognized lines of descent by which America\u2019s national sin is now being visited upon the third and fourth generations.\n[Listen to an episode of the \u201c1619\u201d podcast with Matthew Desmond and Nikole Hannah-Jones about the economy that slavery built.]\nThey picked in long rows, bent bodies shuffling through cotton fields white in bloom. Men, women and children picked, using both hands to hurry the work. Some picked in Negro cloth, their raw product returning to them by way of New England mills. Some picked completely naked. Young children ran water across the humped rows, while overseers peered down from horses. Enslaved workers placed each cotton boll into a sack slung around their necks. Their haul would be weighed after the sunlight stalked away from the fields and, as the freedman Charles Ball recalled, you couldn\u2019t \u201cdistinguish the weeds from the cotton plants.\u201d If the haul came up light, enslaved workers were often whipped. \u201cA short day\u2019s work was always punished,\u201d Ball wrote.\nCotton was to the 19th century what oil was to the 20th: among the world\u2019s most widely traded commodities. Cotton is everywhere, in our clothes, hospitals, soap. Before the industrialization of cotton, people wore expensive clothes made of wool or linen and dressed their beds in furs or straw. Whoever mastered cotton could make a killing. But cotton needed land. A field could only tolerate a few straight years of the crop before its soil became depleted. Planters watched as acres that had initially produced 1,000 pounds of cotton yielded only 400 a few seasons later. The thirst for new farmland grew even more intense after the invention of the cotton gin in the early 1790s. Before the gin, enslaved workers grew more cotton than they could clean. The gin broke the bottleneck, making it possible to clean as much cotton as you could grow.\n[To get updates on The 1619 Project, and for more on race from The New York Times, sign up for our weekly Race/Related newsletter.]\nThe United States solved its land shortage by expropriating millions of acres from Native Americans, often with military force, acquiring Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. It then sold that land on the cheap \u2014 just $1.25 an acre in the early 1830s ($38 in today\u2019s dollars) \u2014 to white settlers. Naturally, the first to cash in were the land speculators. Companies operating in Mississippi flipped land, selling it soon after purchase, commonly for double the price.\nEnslaved workers felled trees by ax, burned the underbrush and leveled the earth for planting. \u201cWhole forests were literally dragged out by the roots,\u201d John Parker, an enslaved worker, remembered. A lush, twisted mass of vegetation was replaced by a single crop. An origin of American money exerting its will on the earth, spoiling the environment for profit, is found in the cotton plantation. Floods became bigger and more common. The lack of biodiversity exhausted the soil and, to quote the historian Walter Johnson, \u201crendered one of the richest agricultural regions of the earth dependent on upriver trade for food.\u201d\nAs slave labor camps spread throughout the South, production surged. By 1831, the country was delivering nearly half the world\u2019s raw cotton crop, with 350 million pounds picked that year. Just four years later, it harvested 500 million pounds. Southern white elites grew rich, as did their counterparts in the North, who erected textile mills to form, in the words of the Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, an \u201cunhallowed alliance between the lords of the lash and the lords of the loom.\u201d The large-scale cultivation of cotton hastened the invention of the factory, an institution that propelled the Industrial Revolution and changed the course of history. In 1810, there were 87,000 cotton spindles in America. Fifty years later, there were five million. Slavery, wrote one of its defenders in De Bow\u2019s Review, a widely read agricultural magazine, was the \u201cnursing mother of the prosperity of the North.\u201d Cotton planters, millers and consumers were fashioning a new economy, one that was global in scope and required the movement of capital, labor and products across long distances. In other words, they were fashioning a capitalist economy. \u201cThe beating heart of this new system,\u201d Beckert writes, \u201cwas slavery.\u201d\nPerhaps you\u2019re reading this at work, maybe at a multinational corporation that runs like a soft-purring engine. You report to someone, and someone reports to you. Everything is tracked, recorded and analyzed, via vertical reporting systems, double-entry record-keeping and precise quantification. Data seems to hold sway over every operation. It feels like a cutting-edge approach to management, but many of these techniques that we now take for granted were developed by and for large plantations.\nWhen an accountant depreciates an asset to save on taxes or when a midlevel manager spends an afternoon filling in rows and columns on an Excel spreadsheet, they are repeating business procedures whose roots twist back to slave-labor camps. And yet, despite this, \u201cslavery plays almost no role in histories of management,\u201d notes the historian Caitlin Rosenthal in her book \u201cAccounting for Slavery.\u201d Since the 1977 publication of Alfred Chandler\u2019s classic study, \u201cThe Visible Hand,\u201d historians have tended to connect the development of modern business practices to the 19th-century railroad industry, viewing plantation slavery as precapitalistic, even primitive. It\u2019s a more comforting origin story, one that protects the idea that America\u2019s economic ascendancy developed not because of, but in spite of, millions of black people toiling on plantations. But management techniques used by 19th-century corporations were implemented during the previous century by plantation owners.\nPlanters aggressively expanded their operations to capitalize on economies of scale inherent to cotton growing, buying more enslaved workers, investing in large gins and presses and experimenting with different seed varieties. To do so, they developed complicated workplace hierarchies that combined a central office, made up of owners and lawyers in charge of capital allocation and long-term strategy, with several divisional units, responsible for different operations. Rosenthal writes of one plantation where the owner supervised a top lawyer, who supervised another lawyer, who supervised an overseer, who supervised three bookkeepers, who supervised 16 enslaved head drivers and specialists (like bricklayers), who supervised hundreds of enslaved workers. Everyone was accountable to someone else, and plantations pumped out not just cotton bales but volumes of data about how each bale was produced. This organizational form was very advanced for its time, displaying a level of hierarchal complexity equaled only by large government structures, like that of the British Royal Navy.\nLike today\u2019s titans of industry, planters understood that their profits climbed when they extracted maximum effort out of each worker. So they paid close attention to inputs and outputs by developing precise systems of record-keeping. Meticulous bookkeepers and overseers were just as important to the productivity of a slave-labor camp as field hands. Plantation entrepreneurs developed spreadsheets, like Thomas Affleck\u2019s \u201cPlantation Record and Account Book,\u201d which ran into eight editions circulated until the Civil War. Affleck\u2019s book was a one-stop-shop accounting manual, complete with rows and columns that tracked per-worker productivity. This book \u201cwas really at the cutting edge of the informational technologies available to businesses during this period,\u201d Rosenthal told me. \u201cI have never found anything remotely as complex as Affleck\u2019s book for free labor.\u201d Enslavers used the book to determine end-of-the-year balances, tallying expenses and revenues and noting the causes of their biggest gains and losses. They quantified capital costs on their land, tools and enslaved workforces, applying Affleck\u2019s recommended interest rate. Perhaps most remarkable, they also developed ways to calculate depreciation, a breakthrough in modern management procedures, by assessing the market value of enslaved workers over their life spans. Values generally peaked between the prime ages of 20 and 40 but were individually adjusted up or down based on sex, strength and temperament: people reduced to data points.\nThis level of data analysis also allowed planters to anticipate rebellion. Tools were accounted for on a regular basis to make sure a large number of axes or other potential weapons didn\u2019t suddenly go missing. \u201cNever allow any slave to lock or unlock any door,\u201d advised a Virginia enslaver in 1847. In this way, new bookkeeping techniques developed to maximize returns also helped to ensure that violence flowed in one direction, allowing a minority of whites to control a much larger group of enslaved black people. American planters never forgot what happened in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) in 1791, when enslaved workers took up arms and revolted. In fact, many white enslavers overthrown during the Haitian Revolution relocated to the United States and started over.\nOverseers recorded each enslaved worker\u2019s yield. Accountings took place not only after nightfall, when cotton baskets were weighed, but throughout the workday. In the words of a North Carolina planter, enslaved workers were to be \u201cfollowed up from day break until dark.\u201d Having hands line-pick in rows sometimes longer than five football fields allowed overseers to spot anyone lagging behind. The uniform layout of the land had a logic; a logic designed to dominate. Faster workers were placed at the head of the line, which encouraged those who followed to match the captain\u2019s pace. When enslaved workers grew ill or old, or became pregnant, they were assigned to lighter tasks. One enslaver established a \u201csucklers gang\u201d for nursing mothers, as well as a \u201cmeasles gang,\u201d which at once quarantined those struck by the virus and ensured that they did their part to contribute to the productivity machine. Bodies and tasks were aligned with rigorous exactitude. In trade magazines, owners swapped advice about the minutiae of planting, including slave diets and clothing as well as the kind of tone a master should use. In 1846, one Alabama planter advised his fellow enslavers to always give orders \u201cin a mild tone, and try to leave the impression on the mind of the negro that what you say is the result of reflection.\u201d The devil (and his profits) were in the details.\nThe uncompromising pursuit of measurement and scientific accounting displayed in slave plantations predates industrialism. Northern factories would not begin adopting these techniques until decades after the Emancipation Proclamation. As the large slave-labor camps grew increasingly efficient, enslaved black people became America\u2019s first modern workers, their productivity increasing at an astonishing pace. During the 60 years leading up to the Civil War, the daily amount of cotton picked per enslaved worker increased 2.3 percent a year. That means that in 1862, the average enslaved fieldworker picked not 25 percent or 50 percent as much but 400 percent as much cotton than his or her counterpart did in 1801.\nToday modern technology has facilitated unremitting workplace supervision, particularly in the service sector. Companies have developed software that records workers\u2019 keystrokes and mouse clicks, along with randomly capturing screenshots multiple times a day. Modern-day workers are subjected to a wide variety of surveillance strategies, from drug tests and closed-circuit video monitoring to tracking apps and even devices that sense heat and motion. A 2006 survey found that more than a third of companies with work forces of 1,000 or more had staff members who read through employees\u2019 outbound emails. The technology that accompanies this workplace supervision can make it feel futuristic. But it\u2019s only the technology that\u2019s new. The core impulse behind that technology pervaded plantations, which sought innermost control over the bodies of their enslaved work force.\nThe cotton plantation was America\u2019s first big business, and the nation\u2019s first corporate Big Brother was the overseer. And behind every cold calculation, every rational fine-tuning of the system, violence lurked. Plantation owners used a combination of incentives and punishments to squeeze as much as possible out of enslaved workers. Some beaten workers passed out from the pain and woke up vomiting. Some \u201cdanced\u201d or \u201ctrembled\u201d with every hit. An 1829 first-person account from Alabama recorded an overseer\u2019s shoving the faces of women he thought had picked too slow into their cotton baskets and opening up their backs. To the historian Edward Baptist, before the Civil War, Americans \u201clived in an economy whose bottom gear was torture.\u201d\nThere is some comfort, I think, in attributing the sheer brutality of slavery to dumb racism. We imagine pain being inflicted somewhat at random, doled out by the stereotypical white overseer, free but poor. But a good many overseers weren\u2019t allowed to whip at will. Punishments were authorized by the higher-ups. It was not so much the rage of the poor white Southerner but the greed of the rich white planter that drove the lash. The violence was neither arbitrary nor gratuitous. It was rational, capitalistic, all part of the plantation\u2019s design. \u201cEach individual having a stated number of pounds of cotton to pick,\u201d a formerly enslaved worker, Henry Watson, wrote in 1848, \u201cthe deficit of which was made up by as many lashes being applied to the poor slave\u2019s back.\u201d Because overseers closely monitored enslaved workers\u2019 picking abilities, they assigned each worker a unique quota. Falling short of that quota could get you beaten, but overshooting your target could bring misery the next day, because the master might respond by raising your picking rate.\nProfits from heightened productivity were harnessed through the anguish of the enslaved. This was why the fastest cotton pickers were often whipped the most. It was why punishments rose and fell with global market fluctuations. Speaking of cotton in 1854, the fugitive slave John Brown remembered, \u201cWhen the price rises in the English market, the poor slaves immediately feel the effects, for they are harder driven, and the whip is kept more constantly going.\u201d Unrestrained capitalism holds no monopoly on violence, but in making possible the pursuit of near limitless personal fortunes, often at someone else\u2019s expense, it does put a cash value on our moral commitments.\nSlavery did supplement white workers with what W.E.B. Du Bois called a \u201cpublic and psychological wage,\u201d which allowed them to roam freely and feel a sense of entitlement. But this, too, served the interests of money. Slavery pulled down all workers\u2019 wages. Both in the cities and countryside, employers had access to a large and flexible labor pool made up of enslaved and free people. Just as in today\u2019s gig economy, day laborers during slavery\u2019s reign often lived under conditions of scarcity and uncertainty, and jobs meant to be worked for a few months were worked for lifetimes. Labor power had little chance when the bosses could choose between buying people, renting them, contracting indentured servants, taking on apprentices or hiring children and prisoners.\nThis not only created a starkly uneven playing field, dividing workers from themselves; it also made \u201call nonslavery appear as freedom,\u201d as the economic historian Stanley Engerman has written. Witnessing the horrors of slavery drilled into poor white workers that things could be worse. So they generally accepted their lot, and American freedom became broadly defined as the opposite of bondage. It was a freedom that understood what it was against but not what it was for; a malnourished and mean kind of freedom that kept you out of chains but did not provide bread or shelter. It was a freedom far too easily pleased.\nIn recent decades, America has experienced the financialization of its economy. In 1980, Congress repealed regulations that had been in place since the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, allowing banks to merge and charge their customers higher interest rates. Since then, increasingly profits have accrued not by trading and producing goods and services but through financial instruments. Between 1980 and 2008, more than $6.6 trillion was transferred to financial firms. After witnessing the successes and excesses of Wall Street, even nonfinancial companies began finding ways to make money from financial products and activities. Ever wonder why every major retail store, hotel chain and airline wants to sell you a credit card? This financial turn has trickled down into our everyday lives: It\u2019s there in our pensions, home mortgages, lines of credit and college-savings portfolios. Americans with some means now act like \u201centerprising subjects,\u201d in the words of the political scientist Robert Aitken.\nAs it\u2019s usually narrated, the story of the ascendancy of American finance tends to begin in 1980, with the gutting of Glass-Steagall, or in 1944 with Bretton Woods, or perhaps in the reckless speculation of the 1920s. But in reality, the story begins during slavery.\nConsider, for example, one of the most popular mainstream financial instruments: the mortgage. Enslaved people were used as collateral for mortgages centuries before the home mortgage became the defining characteristic of middle America. In colonial times, when land was not worth much and banks didn\u2019t exist, most lending was based on human property. In the early 1700s, slaves were the dominant collateral in South Carolina. Many Americans were first exposed to the concept of a mortgage by trafficking in enslaved people, not real estate, and \u201cthe extension of mortgages to slave property helped fuel the development of American (and global) capitalism,\u201d the historian Joshua Rothman told me.\nOr consider a Wall Street financial instrument as modern-sounding as collateralized debt obligations (C.D.O.s), those ticking time bombs backed by inflated home prices in the 2000s. C.D.O.s were the grandchildren of mortgage-backed securities based on the inflated value of enslaved people sold in the 1820s and 1830s. Each product created massive fortunes for the few before blowing up the economy.\nEnslavers were not the first ones to securitize assets and debts in America. The land companies that thrived during the late 1700s relied on this technique, for instance. But enslavers did make use of securities to such an enormous degree for their time, exposing stakeholders throughout the Western world to enough risk to compromise the world economy, that the historian Edward Baptist told me that this can be viewed as \u201ca new moment in international capitalism, where you are seeing the development of a globalized financial market.\u201d The novel thing about the 2008 foreclosure crisis was not the concept of foreclosing on a homeowner but foreclosing on millions of them. Similarly, what was new about securitizing enslaved people in the first half of the 19th century was not the concept of securitization itself but the crazed level of rash speculation on cotton that selling slave debt promoted.\nAs America\u2019s cotton sector expanded, the value of enslaved workers soared. Between 1804 and 1860, the average price of men ages 21 to 38 sold in New Orleans grew to $1,200 from roughly $450. Because they couldn\u2019t expand their cotton empires without more enslaved workers, ambitious planters needed to find a way to raise enough capital to purchase more hands. Enter the banks. The Second Bank of the United States, chartered in 1816, began investing heavily in cotton. In the early 1830s, the slaveholding Southwestern states took almost half the bank\u2019s business. Around the same time, state-chartered banks began multiplying to such a degree that one historian called it an \u201corgy of bank-creation.\u201d\nWhen seeking loans, planters used enslaved people as collateral. Thomas Jefferson mortgaged 150 of his enslaved workers to build Monticello. People could be sold much more easily than land, and in multiple Southern states, more than eight in 10 mortgage-secured loans used enslaved people as full or partial collateral. As the historian Bonnie Martin has written, \u201cslave owners worked their slaves financially, as well as physically from colonial days until emancipation\u201d by mortgaging people to buy more people. Access to credit grew faster than Mississippi kudzu, leading one 1836 observer to remark that in cotton country \u201cmoney, or what passed for money, was the only cheap thing to be had.\u201d\nPlanters took on immense amounts of debt to finance their operations. Why wouldn\u2019t they? The math worked out. A cotton plantation in the first decade of the 19th century could leverage their enslaved workers at 8 percent interest and record a return three times that. So leverage they did, sometimes volunteering the same enslaved workers for multiple mortgages. Banks lent with little restraint. By 1833, Mississippi banks had issued 20 times as much paper money as they had gold in their coffers. In several Southern counties, slave mortgages injected more capital into the economy than sales from the crops harvested by enslaved workers.\nGlobal financial markets got in on the action. When Thomas Jefferson mortgaged his enslaved workers, it was a Dutch firm that put up the money. The Louisiana Purchase, which opened millions of acres to cotton production, was financed by Baring Brothers, the well-heeled British commercial bank. A majority of credit powering the American slave economy came from the London money market. Years after abolishing the African slave trade in 1807, Britain, and much of Europe along with it, was bankrolling slavery in the United States. To raise capital, state-chartered banks pooled debt generated by slave mortgages and repackaged it as bonds promising investors annual interest. During slavery\u2019s boom time, banks did swift business in bonds, finding buyers in Hamburg and Amsterdam, in Boston and Philadelphia.\nSome historians have claimed that the British abolition of the slave trade was a turning point in modernity, marked by the development of a new kind of moral consciousness when people began considering the suffering of others thousands of miles away. But perhaps all that changed was a growing need to scrub the blood of enslaved workers off American dollars, British pounds and French francs, a need that Western financial markets fast found a way to satisfy through the global trade in bank bonds. Here was a means to profit from slavery without getting your hands dirty. In fact, many investors may not have realized that their money was being used to buy and exploit people, just as many of us who are vested in multinational textile companies today are unaware that our money subsidizes a business that continues to rely on forced labor in countries like Uzbekistan and China and child workers in countries like India and Brazil. Call it irony, coincidence or maybe cause \u2014 historians haven\u2019t settled the matter \u2014 but avenues to profit indirectly from slavery grew in popularity as the institution of slavery itself grew more unpopular. \u201cI think they go together,\u201d the historian Calvin Schermerhorn told me. \u201cWe care about fellow members of humanity, but what do we do when we want returns on an investment that depends on their bound labor?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, there is a higher consciousness. But then it comes down to: Where do you get your cotton from?\u201d\nBanks issued tens of millions of dollars in loans on the assumption that rising cotton prices would go on forever. Speculation reached a fever pitch in the 1830s, as businessmen, planters and lawyers convinced themselves that they could amass real treasure by joining in a risky game that everyone seemed to be playing. If planters thought themselves invincible, able to bend the laws of finance to their will, it was most likely because they had been granted authority to bend the laws of nature to their will, to do with the land and the people who worked it as they pleased. Du Bois wrote: \u201cThe mere fact that a man could be, under the law, the actual master of the mind and body of human beings had to have disastrous effects. It tended to inflate the ego of most planters beyond all reason; they became arrogant, strutting, quarrelsome kinglets.\u201d What are the laws of economics to those exercising godlike power over an entire people?\nWe know how these stories end. The American South rashly overproduced cotton thanks to an abundance of cheap land, labor and credit, consumer demand couldn\u2019t keep up with supply, and prices fell. The value of cotton started to drop as early as 1834 before plunging like a bird winged in midflight, setting off the Panic of 1837. Investors and creditors called in their debts, but plantation owners were underwater. Mississippi planters owed the banks in New Orleans $33 million in a year their crops yielded only $10 million in revenue. They couldn\u2019t simply liquidate their assets to raise the money. When the price of cotton tumbled, it pulled down the value of enslaved workers and land along with it. People bought for $2,000 were now selling for $60. Today, we would say the planters\u2019 debt was \u201ctoxic.\u201d\nBecause enslavers couldn\u2019t repay their loans, the banks couldn\u2019t make interest payments on their bonds. Shouts went up around the Western world, as investors began demanding that states raise taxes to keep their promises. After all, the bonds were backed by taxpayers. But after a swell of populist outrage, states decided not to squeeze the money out of every Southern family, coin by coin. But neither did they foreclose on defaulting plantation owners. If they tried, planters absconded to Texas (an independent republic at the time) with their treasure and enslaved work force. Furious bondholders mounted lawsuits and cashiers committed suicide, but the bankrupt states refused to pay their debts. Cotton slavery was too big to fail. The South chose to cut itself out of the global credit market, the hand that had fed cotton expansion, rather than hold planters and their banks accountable for their negligence and avarice.\nEven academic historians, who from their very first graduate course are taught to shun presentism and accept history on its own terms, haven\u2019t been able to resist drawing parallels between the Panic of 1837 and the 2008 financial crisis. All the ingredients are there: mystifying financial instruments that hide risk while connecting bankers, investors and families around the globe; fantastic profits amassed overnight; the normalization of speculation and breathless risk-taking; stacks of paper money printed on the myth that some institution (cotton, housing) is unshakable; considered and intentional exploitation of black people; and impunity for the profiteers when it all falls apart \u2014 the borrowers were bailed out after 1837, the banks after 2008.\nDuring slavery, \u201cAmericans built a culture of speculation unique in its abandon,\u201d writes the historian Joshua Rothman in his 2012 book, \u201cFlush Times and Fever Dreams.\u201d That culture would drive cotton production up to the Civil War, and it has been a defining characteristic of American capitalism ever since. It is the culture of acquiring wealth without work, growing at all costs and abusing the powerless. It is the culture that brought us the Panic of 1837, the stock-market crash of 1929 and the recession of 2008. It is the culture that has produced staggering inequality and undignified working conditions. If today America promotes a particular kind of low-road capitalism \u2014 a union-busting capitalism of poverty wages, gig jobs and normalized insecurity; a winner-take-all capitalism of stunning disparities not only permitting but awarding financial rule-bending; a racist capitalism that ignores the fact that slavery didn\u2019t just deny black freedom but built white fortunes, originating the black-white wealth gap that annually grows wider \u2014 one reason is that American capitalism was founded on the lowest road there is.\nMatthew Desmond is a professor of sociology at Princeton University and a contributing writer for the magazine.

Absolutely,\" said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican who heads the Military Research and Development Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, in a telephone interview on Friday. Weldon held a closed-door briefing last month at which military officials told House members that the Pentagon was facing new threats from hackers.\nRelated Article\nComputer Hackers Are Stopped; Pentagon Networks Were Victim\n(March 5, 1999)\n\"Attack\" is a strong word, one that might bring to mind the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor. But some computer security experts stress that while the hacker activity that the House heard about is a potential threat, calling it an attack could be an overstatement. Much of it appears to be something closer to cold war espionage than a bombing run.\nThe Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Va., first detected the unusual activity that John J. Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, described to the House last month. Fred Kerby, the information system security manager at the center, characterized it as a \"low and slow scan,\" designed to map out military computer networks without attracting attention.\nDrew Dean, a computer security expert at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, said it could be misleading to characterize this kind of scan as a full attack.\n\"It's a precursor to attack,\" he said. \"If someone I didn't know scanned my machine, I would assume it was an unfriendly act.\" Dean noted, however, that there are often legitimate and innocent reasons for a computer user to check out another machine across the Internet.\nIn fact, the Norwegian Supreme Court was recently asked to rule on whether or not such scanning was illegal. The court decided that it was not, because it was similar to a knock on the door, not forced entry.\nA hacker wanting to learn something about an organization's computer network might begin by scanning the network with the \"ping\" protocol, which sends a small packet of data to a computer and asks it to respond to see if it is connected to the network. This is equivalent to calling a list of sequential telephone numbers and seeing who answers.\nKerby at the Naval Surface Warfare Center said that most military sites routinely block out ping requests. \"We don't allow them through,\" he said. \"We regard them as an ankle biter ... We just note that they came up and rang the door bell, but we had everything secured before they got here.\"\nSome hackers use more sophisticated probes. It is possible, for instance, to see if a computer accepts e-mail by sending a trial message. This information can be exploited, in some cases, because older versions of the popular e-mail program known as Sendmail have numerous security holes that could give a hacker access to a system. Robert Tappan Morris Jr., then an undergraduate at Cornell University, used one such hole to launch a \"worm\" program that crippled the Internet in 1988.\nIn the case of the latest probes, the hackers tried to conceal the scale of their effort by sending requests from a number of different computers.\n\"This is what's known as a coordinated attack,\" said John Green, a senior security analyst at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. \"It's not detected by most commercial detection systems. What made this significant is that it was low and slow. We would get very few packets from each site.\"\nThe Dahlgren center discovered these distributed probes with a new surveillance system they designed called \"Shadow,\" which looks for patterns in data traffic. In this case, it analyzed packet flows over several months and revealed that many machines were being completely probed.\n\"Instead of hitting 65,536 ports on one computer, they'll be probing one or two ports on each computer, then one or two on another computer,\" Kerby said. After some time, all of the ports on each computer would have been systematically probed by several machines acting in concert.\n\"Scanning or probing is just a reconnaissance effort,\" Green said. \"Once they gather a map of your network, they can then go back and target the machines that they've discovered.\"\nAssessing the real danger of this activity is difficult to do. Many people use tools like the ping protocol to test and debug their networks. In fact, those probing the military networks may be using the same tools used routinely by the network administrators, because they have both legitimate and illegitimate uses.\nDetermining the scope of the hackers' effort is also hard, in part because the Department of Defense refuses to say much about them. The investigation is still unfolding and is also classified.\nThe Pentagon has said that, as is the case with a vast majority of hacking attempts, the recent probes did not result in the penetration of any computers storing sensitive information. Also, the Dahlgren center said it found a way to thwart this method of probing, and has told all military services about the remedy. It has posted the Shadow software on its Web site so any organization can use it freely.\nSome security experts and critics of the military budget dismiss the recent talk of \"cyberwar\" as a public relations effort, intended to get Congress to increase military spending. They point out that truly sensitive government computers are not even connected to the Internet. It is important to ask, they say, whether the activity described to Congress was an attempt to launch missiles or just probes of innocent desktop computers used to surf the Web.\n\"It would not surprise me if this was a public relations maneuver,\" said Winn Schwartau, a security consultant and author of the book \"Information Warfare,\" in a telephone interview on Friday.\nSchwartau said, however, that the nation is not spending enough to defend itself from enemies armed with computers and hacking expertise. \"Maybe they're being more open about it to help with the overall awareness that America is sorely lacking,\" he said.\n\"Is surveillance an offensive activity?\" Schwartau asked. \"Under the cold-war mentality, it was. A U2 surveillance of Russia was considered offensive. Some satellite surveillance was considered offensive.\"\nMilitary computers have long been a favorite target of members of the hacker underground wanting to show off their skills. But Representative Weldon said it is important not to dismiss all hacking attempts as the work of computerized joyriders.\n\"I can tell you, I know there are countries out there that are putting money into information warfare,\" he said. \"You know, they can't match our military, so they take what they have: high-performance computers and people who know systems. Then you work on compromising our systems.\"\nWeldon noted that the Defense Department is not the only target of malicious hackers. \"We know of banks who've had their firewalls broken and money transferred out, and they're not going to talk about it,\" he said. The private sector needs to cooperate more with the government in this area, he said.\nRelated Sites\nThese sites are not part of The New York Times on the Web, and The Times has no control over their content or availability.\nPeter Wayner at pwayner@nytimes.com welcomes your comments and suggestions.\n|\n|\nHome | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace\nQuick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel\nHelp/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today\nCopyright 1999 The New York Times Company", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

What Went Wrong?", "normalized_article_title": "the internet is overrun with images of child sexual abuse. what went wrong", "text_content": "The Internet Is Overrun With Images of Child Sexual Abuse. What Went Wrong?\nOnline predators create and share the illegal material, which is increasingly cloaked by technology. Tech companies, the government and the authorities are no match.\nThe images are horrific. Children, some just 3 or 4 years old, being sexually abused and in some cases tortured.\nPictures of child sexual abuse have long been produced and shared to satisfy twisted adult obsessions. But it has never been like this: Technology companies reported a record 45 million online photos and videos of the abuse last year.\nMore than a decade ago, when the reported number was less than a million, the proliferation of the explicit imagery had already reached a crisis point. Tech companies, law enforcement agencies and legislators in Washington responded, committing to new measures meant to rein in the scourge. Landmark legislation passed in 2008.\nYet the explosion in detected content kept growing \u2014 exponentially.\nAn investigation by The New York Times found an insatiable criminal underworld that had exploited the flawed and insufficient efforts to contain it. As with hate speech and terrorist propaganda, many tech companies failed to adequately police sexual abuse imagery on their platforms, or failed to cooperate sufficiently with the authorities when they found it.\nLaw enforcement agencies devoted to the problem were left understaffed and underfunded, even as they were asked to handle far larger caseloads.\nThe Justice Department, given a major role by Congress, neglected even to write mandatory monitoring reports, nor did it appoint a senior executive-level official to lead a crackdown. And the group tasked with serving as a federal clearinghouse for the imagery \u2014 the go-between for the tech companies and the authorities \u2014 was ill equipped for the expanding demands.\nA paper recently published in conjunction with that group, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, described a system at \u201ca breaking point,\u201d with reports of abusive images \u201cexceeding the capabilities of independent clearinghouses and law enforcement to take action.\u201d It suggested that future advancements in machine learning might be the only way to catch up with the criminals.\nBy Rich Harris | Source: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\nThe Times reviewed over 10,000 pages of police and court documents; conducted software tests to assess the availability of the imagery through search engines; accompanied detectives on raids; and spoke with investigators, lawmakers, tech executives and government officials. The reporting included conversations with an admitted pedophile who concealed his identity using encryption software and who runs a site that has hosted as many as 17,000 such images.\nIn interviews, victims across the United States described in heart-wrenching detail how their lives had been upended by the abuse. Children, raped by relatives and strangers alike, being told it was normal. Adults, now years removed from their abuse, still living in fear of being recognized from photos and videos on the internet. And parents of the abused, struggling to cope with the guilt of not having prevented it and their powerlessness over stopping its online spread.\nMany of the survivors and their families said their view of humanity had been inextricably changed by the crimes themselves and the online demand for images of them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to deal with it,\u201d said one woman who, at age 11, had been filmed being sexually assaulted by her father. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to feel O.K. and not let something like this define your whole life. But the thing with the pictures is \u2014 that\u2019s the thing that keeps this alive.\u201d\nThe Times\u2019s reporting revealed a problem global in scope \u2014 most of the images found last year were traced to other countries \u2014 but one firmly rooted in the United States because of the central role Silicon Valley has played in facilitating the imagery\u2019s spread and in reporting it to the authorities.\nWhile the material, commonly known as child pornography, predates the digital era, smartphone cameras, social media and cloud storage have allowed the images to multiply at an alarming rate. Both recirculated and new images occupy all corners of the internet, including a range of platforms as diverse as Facebook Messenger, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine and the storage service Dropbox.\nIn a particularly disturbing trend, online groups are devoting themselves to sharing images of younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies and the dark web, the vast underbelly of the internet, to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. In some online forums, children are forced to hold up signs with the name of the group or other identifying information to prove the images are fresh.\nWith so many reports of the abuse coming their way, law enforcement agencies across the country said they were often besieged. Some have managed their online workload by focusing on imagery depicting the youngest victims.\n\u201cWe go home and think, \u2018Good grief, the fact that we have to prioritize by age is just really disturbing,\u2019\u201d said Detective Paula Meares, who has investigated child sex crimes for more than 10 years at the Los Angeles Police Department.\nIn some sense, increased detection of the spiraling problem is a sign of progress. Tech companies are legally required to report images of child abuse only when they discover them; they are not required to look for them.\nAfter years of uneven monitoring of the material, several major tech companies, including Facebook and Google, stepped up surveillance of their platforms. In interviews, executives with some companies pointed to the voluntary monitoring and the spike in reports as indications of their commitment to addressing the problem.\nBut police records and emails, as well as interviews with nearly three dozen local, state and federal law enforcement officials, show that some tech companies still fall short. It can take weeks or months for them to respond to questions from the authorities, if they respond at all. Sometimes they respond only to say they have no records, even for reports they initiated.\nAnd when tech companies cooperate fully, encryption and anonymization can create digital hiding places for perpetrators. Facebook announced in March plans to encrypt Messenger, which last year was responsible for nearly 12 million of the 18.4 million worldwide reports of child sexual abuse material, according to people familiar with the reports. Reports to the authorities typically contain more than one image, and last year encompassed the record 45 million photos and videos, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nAll the while, criminals continue to trade and stockpile caches of the material.\nThe law Congress passed in 2008 foresaw many of today\u2019s problems, but The Times found that the federal government had not fulfilled major aspects of the legislation.\nThe Justice Department has produced just two of six required reports that are meant to compile data about internet crimes against children and set goals to eliminate them, and there has been a constant churn of short-term appointees leading the department\u2019s efforts. The first person to hold the position, Francey Hakes, said it was clear from the outset that no one \u201cfelt like the position was as important as it was written by Congress to be.\u201d\nThe federal government has also not lived up to the law\u2019s funding goals, severely crippling efforts to stamp out the activity.\nCongress has regularly allocated about half of the $60 million in yearly funding for state and local law enforcement efforts. Separately, the Department of Homeland Security this year diverted nearly $6 million from its cybercrimes units to immigration enforcement \u2014 depleting 40 percent of the units\u2019 discretionary budget until the final month of the fiscal year.\nAlicia Kozakiewicz, who was abducted by a man she had met on the internet when she was 13, said the lack of follow-through was disheartening. Now an advocate for laws preventing crimes against children, she had testified in support of the 2008 legislation.\n\u201cI remember looking around the room, and there wasn\u2019t a dry eye,\u201d said Ms. Kozakiewicz, 31, who had told of being chained, raped and beaten while her kidnapper live-streamed the abuse on the internet. \u201cThe federal bill passed, but it wasn\u2019t funded. So it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nFurther impairing the federal response are shortcomings at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which reviews reports it receives and then distributes them to federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, as well as international partners.\nThe nonprofit center has relied in large measure on 20-year-old technology, has difficulty keeping experienced engineers on staff and, by its own reckoning, regards stopping the online distribution of photos and videos secondary to rescuing children.\n\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s a resource and volume issue,\u201d said John Shehan, a vice president at the center, which was established 35 years ago to track missing children. \u201cFirst priority is making sure we\u2019re assessing the risk of the children. We\u2019re getting this information into the hands of law enforcement.\u201d\nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat from Florida who was an author of the 2008 law, said in an interview that she was unaware of the extent of the federal government\u2019s failures. After being briefed on The Times\u2019s findings, she sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr requesting an accounting.\nStacie B. Harris, the Justice Department\u2019s coordinator over the past year for combating child exploitation, said the problem was systemic, extending well beyond the department and her tenure there. \u201cWe are trying to play catch-up because we know that this is a huge, huge problem,\u201d said Ms. Harris, an associate deputy attorney general.\nThe fallout for law enforcement, in some instances, has been crushing.\nWhen reviewing tips from the national center, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has narrowed its focus to images of infants and toddlers. And about one of every 10 agents in Homeland Security\u2019s investigative section \u2014 which deals with all kinds of threats, including terrorism \u2014 is now assigned to child sexual exploitation cases.\n\u201cWe could double our numbers and still be getting crushed,\u201d said Jonathan Hendrix, a Homeland Security agent who investigates cases in Nashville.\nThe Cutting Edge\nThe videos found on the computer of an Ohio man were described by investigators as among \u201cthe most gruesome and violent images of child pornography.\u201d\nOne showed a woman orally forcing herself on a girl who was then held upside down by the ankles in a bathroom while \u201canother child urinates\u201d on her face, according to court documents.\nAnother showed a woman \u201cinserting an ice cube into the vagina\u201d of a young girl, the documents said, before tying her ankles together, taping her mouth shut and suspending her upside down. As the video continued, the girl was beaten, slapped and burned with a match or candle.\n\u201cThe predominant sound is the child screaming and crying,\u201d according to a federal agent quoted in the documents.\nThe videos were stored in a hidden computer file and had also been encrypted, one common way abusive imagery has been able to race across the internet with impunity.\nIncreasingly, criminals are using advanced technologies like encryption to stay ahead of the police. In this case, the Ohio man, who helped run a website on the dark web known as the Love Zone, had over 3 million photos and videos on his computers.\nThe site, now shuttered, had nearly 30,000 members and required them to share images of abuse to maintain good standing, according to the court documents. A private section of the forum was available only to members who shared imagery of children they abused themselves. They were known as \u201cproducers.\u201d\nMultiple police investigations over the past few years have broken up enormous dark web forums, including one known as Child\u2019s Play that was reported to have had over a million user accounts.\nThe highly skilled perpetrators often taunt the authorities with their technical skills, acting boldly because they feel protected by the cover of darkness.\n\u201cPeople who traffic in child exploitation materials are on the cutting edge of technology,\u201d said Susan Hennessey, a former lawyer at the National Security Agency who researches cybersecurity at the Brookings Institution.\nOffenders can cover their tracks by connecting to virtual private networks, which mask their locations; deploying encryption techniques, which can hide their messages and make their hard drives impenetrable; and posting on the dark web, which is inaccessible to conventional browsers.\nThe anonymity offered by the sites emboldens members to post images of very young children being sexually abused, and in increasingly extreme and violent forms.\n\u201cHistorically, you would never have gone to a black market shop and asked, \u2018I want real hard-core with 3-year-olds,\u2019\u201d said Yolanda Lippert, a prosecutor in Cook County, Ill., who leads a team investigating online child abuse. \u201cBut now you can sit seemingly secure on your device searching for this stuff, trading for it.\u201d\nExhibits in the case of the Love Zone, sealed by the court but released by a judge after a request by The Times, include screenshots showing the forum had dedicated areas where users discussed ways to remain \u201csafe\u201d while posting and downloading the imagery. Tips included tutorials on how to encrypt and share material without being detected by the authorities.\nThe offender in Ohio, a site administrator named Jason Gmoser, \u201cwent to great lengths to hide\u201d his conduct, according to the documents. Testimony in his criminal case revealed that it would have taken the authorities \u201ctrillions of years\u201d to crack the 41-character password he had used to encrypt the site. He eventually turned it over to investigators, and was sentenced to life in prison in 2016.\nThe site was run by a number of men, including Brian Davis, a worker at a child day care center in Illinois who admitted to documenting abuse of his own godson and more than a dozen other children \u2014 aged 3 months to 8 years \u2014 and sharing images of the assaults with other members. Mr. Davis made over 400 posts on the site. One image showed him orally raping a 2-year-old; another depicted a man raping an infant\u2019s anus.\nMr. Davis, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2016, said that \u201ccapturing the abuse on video was part of the excitement,\u201d according to court records.\nSome of his victims attended the court proceedings and submitted statements about their continuing struggles with the abuse.\n\u2018Truly Terrible Things\u2019\nThe surge in criminal activity on the dark web accounted for only a fraction of the 18.4 million reports of abuse last year. That number originates almost entirely with tech companies based in the United States.\nThe companies have known for years that their platforms were being co-opted by predators, but many of them essentially looked the other way, according to interviews and emails detailing the companies\u2019 activities. And while many companies have made recent progress in identifying the material, they were slow to respond.\nHemanshu Nigam, a former federal prosecutor in cybercrime and child exploitation cases, said it was clear more than two decades ago that new technologies had created the biggest boon for pedophiles since the Polaroid camera.\nThe recent surge by tech companies in filing reports of online abuse \u201cwouldn\u2019t exist if they did their job then,\u201d said Mr. Nigam, who now runs a cybersecurity consulting firm and previously held top security roles at Microsoft, Myspace and News Corporation.\nHany Farid, who worked with Microsoft to develop technology in 2009 for detecting child sexual abuse material, said tech companies had been reluctant for years to dig too deeply.\n\u201cThe companies knew the house was full of roaches, and they were scared to turn the lights on,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when they did turn the lights on, it was worse than they thought.\u201d\nFederal law requires companies to preserve material about their reports of abuse imagery for 90 days. But given the overwhelming number of reports, it is not uncommon for requests from the authorities to reach companies too late.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge issue for us,\u201d said Capt. Mike Edwards, a Seattle police commander who oversees a cybercrimes unit for the State of Washington. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a short period of time to be able to get the data if it was preserved.\u201d\nMost tech companies have been quick to respond to urgent inquiries, but responses in other cases vary significantly. In interviews, law enforcement officials pointed to Tumblr, a blogging and social networking site with 470 million users, as one of the most problematic companies.\nPolice officers in Missouri, New Jersey, Texas and Wisconsin lamented Tumblr\u2019s poor response to requests, with one officer describing the issues as \u201clong-term and ongoing\u201d in an internal document.\nA recent investigation in Polk County, Wis., that included an image of a man orally raping a young child stalled for over a year. The investigator retired before Tumblr responded to numerous emails requesting information.\nIn a 2016 Wisconsin case, Tumblr alerted a person who had uploaded explicit images that the account had been referred to the authorities, a practice that a former employee told The Times had been common for years. The tip allowed the man to destroy evidence on his electronic devices, the police said.\nA spokeswoman for Verizon said that Tumblr prioritized time-sensitive cases, which delayed other responses. Since Verizon acquired the company in 2017, the spokeswoman said, its practice was not to alert users of police requests for data. Verizon recently sold Tumblr to the web development company Automattic.\nThe law enforcement officials also pointed to problems with Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, and Snap, the parent company of the social network Snapchat.\nBing was said to regularly submit reports that lacked essential information, making investigations difficult, if not impossible. Snapchat, a platform especially popular with young people, is engineered to delete most of its content within a short period of time. According to law enforcement, when requests are made to the company, Snap often replies that it has no additional information.\nA Microsoft spokesman said that the company had only limited information about offenders using the search engine, and that it was cooperating as best as it could. A Snap spokesman said the company preserved data in compliance with the law.\nData obtained through a public records request suggests Facebook\u2019s plans to encrypt Messenger in the coming years will lead to vast numbers of images of child abuse going undetected. The data shows that WhatsApp, the company\u2019s encrypted messaging app, submits only a small fraction of the reports Messenger does.\nFacebook has long known about abusive images on its platforms, including a video of a man sexually assaulting a 6-year-old that went viral last year on Messenger. When Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, announced in March that Messenger would move to encryption, he acknowledged the risk it presented for \u201ctruly terrible things like child exploitation.\u201d\n\u201cEncryption is a powerful tool for privacy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that includes the privacy of people doing bad things.\u201d\n\u2018Vastly Inadequate\u2019\n\u201cIn a recent case, an offender filmed himself drugging the juice boxes of neighborhood children before tricking them into drinking the mix,\u201d said Special Agent Flint Waters, a criminal investigator for the State of Wyoming. \u201cHe then filmed himself as he sexually abused unconscious children.\u201d\nMr. Waters, appearing before Congress in Washington, was describing what he said \u201cwe see every day.\u201d\nHe went on to present a map of the United States covered with red dots, each representing a computer used to share images of child sex abuse. Fewer than two percent of the crimes would be investigated, he predicted. \u201cWe are overwhelmed, we are underfunded and we are drowning in the tidal wave of tragedy,\u201d he said.\nMr. Waters\u2019s testimony was delivered 12 years ago \u2014 in 2007.\nThe following year, Congress passed legislation that acknowledged the severity of the crisis. But then the federal government largely moved on. Some of the strongest provisions of the law were not fulfilled, and many problems went unfixed, according to interviews and government documents.\nToday, Mr. Waters\u2019s testimony offers a haunting reminder of time lost.\nAnnual funding for state and regional investigations was authorized at $60 million, but only about half of that is regularly approved. It has increased only slightly from 10 years ago when accounting for inflation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat of Connecticut who was a sponsor of the law\u2019s reauthorization, said there was \u201cno adequate or logical explanation and no excuse\u201d for why more money was not allocated. Even $60 million a year, he said, would now be \u201cvastly inadequate.\u201d\nAnother cornerstone of the law, the biennial strategy reports by the Justice Department, was mostly ignored. Even the most recent of the two reports that were published, in 2010 and 2016, did not include data about some of the most pressing concerns, such as the trade in illicit imagery.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s coordinator for child exploitation prevention, Ms. Harris, said she could not explain the poor record. A spokeswoman for the department, citing limited resources, said the reports would now be written every four years beginning in 2020.\nWhen the law was reauthorized in 2012, the coordinator role was supposed to be elevated to a senior executive position with broad authority. That has not happened. \u201cThis is supposed to be the quarterback,\u201d said Ms. Wasserman Schultz, one of the provision\u2019s authors.\nEven when the Justice Department has been publicly called out for ignoring provisions of the law, there has been little change.\nIn 2011, the Government Accountability Office reported that no steps had been taken to research which online offenders posed a high risk to children, and that the Justice Department had not submitted a progress assessment to Congress, both requirements of the law.\nAt the time, the department said it did not have enough funding to undertake the research and had no \u201ctime frame\u201d for submitting a report. Today, the provisions remain largely unfulfilled.\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which testified in favor of the 2008 law, has also struggled with demands to contain the spread of the imagery.\nFounded in 1984 after the well-publicized kidnapping and murder of a 6-year-old Florida boy, Adam Walsh, the center has been closely affiliated with the federal government since the Reagan administration.\nBut as child exploitation has grown on the internet, the center has not kept up. The technology it uses for receiving and reviewing reports of the material was created in 1998, nearly a decade before the first iPhone was released. To perform key upgrades and help modernize the system, the group has relied on donations from tech companies like Palantir and Google.\nThe center has said it intends to make significant improvements to its technology starting in 2020, but the problems don\u2019t stop there. The police complain that the most urgent reports are not prioritized, or are sent to the wrong department completely.\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending a tremendous amount of time having to go through those and reanalyze them ourselves,\u201d said Captain Edwards, the Seattle police official.\nIn a statement, the national center said it did its best to route reports to the correct jurisdiction.\nDespite its mandate by Congress, the center is not subject to public records laws and operates with little transparency. It repeatedly denied requests from The Times for quarterly and annual reports submitted to the Justice Department, as well as for tallies of imagery reports submitted by individual tech companies.\nMr. Shehan, the vice president, said such disclosures might discourage tech companies from cooperating with the center. He said the numbers could be misinterpreted.\nThe Times found that there was a close relationship between the center and Silicon Valley that raised questions about good governance practices. For example, the center receives both money and in-kind donations from tech companies, while employees of the same companies are sometimes members of its board. Google alone has donated nearly $4 million in the past decade, according to public testimony.\nA spokeswoman for the center said it was common to expect corporations to provide financial assistance to charities. But the practice, others working in the area of child protection say, could elevate the interests of the tech companies above the children\u2019s.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inherent conflict in accepting money from these companies when they also sit on your board,\u201d said Signy Arnason, who is a top executive at the equivalent organization in Canada, known as the Canadian Center for Child Protection.\nThis close relationship with tech companies may ultimately be in jeopardy. In 2016, a federal court held that the national center, though private, qualified legally as a government entity because it performed a number of essential government functions.\nIf that view gains traction, Fourth Amendment challenges about searches and seizures by the government could change how the center operates and how tech companies find and remove illegal imagery on their platforms. Under those circumstances, if they were to collaborate too closely with the center, the companies fear, they could also be viewed as government actors, not private entities, subjecting them to new legal requirements and court challenges when they police their own sites.\nAn Ugly Mirror\nIt was a sunny afternoon in July, and an unmarked police van in Salt Lake City was parked outside a pink stucco house. Garden gnomes and a heart-shaped \u201cWelcome Friends\u201d sign decorated the front yard.\nAt the back of the van, a man who lived in the house was seated in a cramped interrogation area, while officers cataloged hard drives and sifted through web histories from his computers.\nThe man had shared sexually explicit videos online, the police said, including one of a 10-year-old boy being \u201corally sodomized\u201d by a man, and another of a man forcing two young boys to engage in anal intercourse.\n\u201cThe sad thing is that\u2019s pretty tame compared to what we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Chief Jessica Farnsworth, an official with the Utah attorney general\u2019s office who led a raid of the house. The victims have not been identified or rescued.\nThe year was barely half over, and Chief Farnsworth\u2019s team had already conducted about 150 such raids across Utah. The specially trained group, one of 61 nationwide, coordinates state and regional responses to internet crimes against children.\nThe Utah group expects to arrest nearly twice as many people this year as last year for crimes related to child sexual abuse material, but federal funding has not kept pace with the surge. Funding for the 61 task forces from 2010 to 2018 remained relatively flat, federal data shows, while the number of leads referred to them increased by more than 400 percent.\nNote: Data is for fiscal years.\nBy Rich Harris and Rumsey Taylor | Source: Justice Department\nMuch of the federal money goes toward training new staff members because the cases take a heavy emotional and psychological toll on investigators, resulting in constant turnover.\n\u201cI thought that I was in the underbelly of society \u2014 until I came here,\u201d said Ms. Lippert, the prosecutor with the task force in Illinois, who had worked for years at a busy Chicago courthouse.\nWhile any child at imminent risk remains a priority, the volume of work has also forced the task forces to make difficult choices. Some have focused on the youngest and most vulnerable victims, while others have cut back on undercover operations, including infiltrating chat rooms and online forums.\n\u201cI think some of the bigger fish who are out there are staying out there,\u201d Ms. Lippert said.\nThe internet is well known as a haven for hate speech, terrorism-related content and criminal activity, all of which have raised alarms and spurred public debate and action.\nBut the problem of child sexual abuse imagery faces a particular hurdle: It gets scant attention because few people want to confront the enormity and horror of the content, or they wrongly dismiss it as primarily teenagers sending inappropriate selfies.\nSome state lawmakers, judges and members of Congress have refused to discuss the problem in detail, or have avoided attending meetings and hearings when it was on the agenda, according to interviews with law enforcement officials and victims.\nSteven J. Grocki, who leads a group of policy experts and lawyers at the child exploitation section of the Justice Department, said the reluctance to address the issue went beyond elected officials and was a societal problem. \u201cThey turn away from it because it\u2019s too ugly of a mirror,\u201d he said.\nYet the material is everywhere, and ever more available.\n\u201cI think that people were always there, but the access is so easy,\u201d said Lt. John Pizzuro, a task force commander in New Jersey. \u201cYou got nine million people in the state of New Jersey. Based upon statistics, we can probably arrest 400,000 people.\u201d\nCommon language about the abuse can also minimize the harm in people\u2019s minds. While the imagery is often defined as \u201cchild pornography\u201d in state and federal laws, experts prefer terms like child sexual abuse imagery or child exploitation material to underscore the seriousness of the crimes and to avoid conflating it with adult pornography, which is legal for people over 18.\n\u201cEach and every image is a depiction of a crime in progress,\u201d said Sgt. Jeff Swanson, a task force commander in Kansas. \u201cThe violence inflicted on these kids is unimaginable.\u201d\nProduced by Rich Harris, Virginia Lozano, Adriana Rami\u0107 and Rumsey Taylor.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Now some of those faces may have the ability to sue.\nOne day in 2005, a mother in Evanston, Ill., joined Flickr. She uploaded some pictures of her children, Chloe and Jasper. Then she more or less forgot her account existed.\nYears later, their faces are in a database that\u2019s used to test and train some of the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems in the world.\nHow Photos of Your Kids Are Powering Surveillance Technology\nMillions of Flickr images were sucked into a database called MegaFace. Now some of those faces may have the ability to sue.\nThe pictures of Chloe and Jasper Papa as kids are typically goofy fare: grinning with their parents; sticking their tongues out; costumed for Halloween. Their mother, Dominique Allman Papa, uploaded them to Flickr after joining the photo-sharing site in 2005.\nNone of them could have foreseen that 14 years later, those images would reside in an unprecedentedly huge facial-recognition database called MegaFace. Containing the likenesses of nearly 700,000 individuals, it has been downloaded by dozens of companies to train a new generation of face-identification algorithms, used to track protesters, surveil terrorists, spot problem gamblers and spy on the public at large.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gross and uncomfortable,\u201d said Mx. Papa, who is now 19 and attending college in Oregon. \u201cI wish they would have asked me first if I wanted to be part of it. I think artificial intelligence is cool and I want it to be smarter, but generally you ask people to participate in research. I learned that in high school biology.\u201d\nBy law, most Americans in the database don\u2019t need to be asked for their permission \u2014 but the Papas should have been.\nAs residents of Illinois, they are protected by one of the strictest state privacy laws on the books: the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a 2008 measure that imposes financial penalties for using an Illinoisan\u2019s fingerprints or face scans without consent.\nThose who used the database \u2014 companies including Google, Amazon, Mitsubishi Electric, Tencent and SenseTime \u2014 appear to have been unaware of the law, and as a result may have huge financial liability, according to several lawyers and law professors familiar with the legislation.\nHow MegaFace was born\nHow did the Papas and hundreds of thousands of other people end up in the database? It\u2019s a roundabout story.\nIn the infancy of facial-recognition technology, researchers developed their algorithms with subjects\u2019 clear consent: In the 1990s, universities had volunteers come to studios to be photographed from many angles. Later, researchers turned to more aggressive and surreptitious methods to gather faces at a grander scale, tapping into surveillance cameras in coffee shops, college campuses and public spaces, and scraping photos posted online.\nAccording to Adam Harvey, an artist who tracks the data sets, there are probably more than 200 in existence, containing tens of millions of photos of approximately one million people. (Some of the sets are derived from others, so the figures include some duplicates.) But these caches had flaws. Surveillance images are often low quality, for example, and gathering pictures from the internet tends to yield too many celebrities.\nIn June 2014, seeking to advance the cause of computer vision, Yahoo unveiled what it called \u201cthe largest public multimedia collection that has ever been released,\u201d featuring 100 million photos and videos. Yahoo got the images \u2014 all of which had Creative Commons or commercial use licenses \u2014 from Flickr, a subsidiary.\nThe database creators said their motivation was to even the playing field in machine learning. Researchers need enormous amounts of data to train their algorithms, and workers at just a few information-rich companies \u2014 like Facebook and Google \u2014 had a big advantage over everyone else.\n\u201cWe wanted to empower the research community by giving them a robust database,\u201d said David Ayman Shamma, who was a director of research at Yahoo until 2016 and helped create the Flickr project. Users weren\u2019t notified that their photos and videos were included, but Mr. Shamma and his team built in what they thought was a safeguard.\nThey didn\u2019t distribute users\u2019 photos directly, but rather links to the photos; that way, if a user deleted the images or made them private, they would no longer be accessible through the database.\nBut this safeguard was flawed. The New York Times found a security vulnerability that allows a Flickr user\u2019s photos to be accessed even after they\u2019ve been made private. (Scott Kinzie, a spokesman for SmugMug, which acquired Flickr from Yahoo in 2018, said the flaw \u201cpotentially impacts a very small number of our members today, and we are actively working to deploy an update as quickly as possible.\u201d Ben MacAskill, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, added that the Yahoo collection was created \u201cyears before our engagement with Flickr.\u201d)\nAdditionally, some researchers who accessed the database simply downloaded versions of the images and then redistributed them, including a team from the University of Washington. In 2015, two of the school\u2019s computer science professors \u2014 Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and Steve Seitz \u2014 and their graduate students used the Flickr data to create MegaFace.\nContaining more than four million photos of some 672,000 people, it held deep promise for testing and perfecting face-recognition algorithms.\nMonitoring Uighurs and outing porn actors\nImportantly to the University of Washington researchers, MegaFace included children like Chloe and Jasper Papa. Face-recognition systems tend to perform poorly on young people, but Flickr offered a chance to improve that with a bonanza of children\u2019s faces, for the simple reason that people love posting photos of their kids online.\nIn 2015 and 2016, the University of Washington ran the \u201cMegaFace Challenge,\u201d inviting groups working on face-recognition technology to use the data set to test how well their algorithms were working.\nThe school asked people downloading the data to agree to use it only for \u201cnoncommercial research and educational purposes.\u201d More than 100 organizations participated, including Google, Tencent, SenseTime and NtechLab. In all, according to a 2016 university news release, \u201cmore than 300 research groups\u201d have worked with the database. It has been publicly cited by researchers from Amazon and, according to Mr. Harvey, Mitsubishi Electric and Philips.\nSome of these companies have been criticized for the way clients have deployed their algorithms: SenseTime\u2019s technology has been used to monitor the Uighur population in China, while NtechLab\u2019s has been used to out pornography actors and identify strangers on the subway in Russia.\nSenseTime\u2019s chief marketing officer, June Jin, said that company researchers used the MegaFace database only for academic purposes. \u201cResearchers have to use the same data set to ensure their results are comparable like-for-like,\u201d Ms. Jin wrote in an email. \u201cAs MegaFace is the most widely recognized database of its kind, it has become the de facto facial-recognition training and test set for the global academic and research community.\u201d\nNtechLab spokesman Nikolay Grunin said the company deleted MegaFace after taking part in the challenge, and added that \u201cthe main build of our algorithm has never been trained on these images.\u201d Google declined to comment.\nA spokeswoman for the University of Washington declined to make MegaFace\u2019s lead researchers available for interviews, saying they \u201chave moved on to other projects and don\u2019t have the time to comment on this.\u201d Efforts to contact them individually were unsuccessful.\nMegaFace\u2019s creation was financed in part by Samsung, Google\u2019s Faculty Research Award, and by the National Science Foundation/Intel.\nIn recent years, Ms. Kemelmacher-Shlizerman has sold a face-swapping image company to Facebook and advanced deep-fake technology by converting audio clips of Barack Obama into a realistic, synthetic video of him giving a speech. She is now working on a \u201cmoonshot project\u201d at Google.\n\u2018What the hell? That is bonkers\u2019\nMegaFace remains publicly available for download. When The New York Times recently requested access, it was granted within a minute.\nMegaFace doesn\u2019t contain people\u2019s names, but its data is not anonymized. A spokesman for the University of Washington said researchers wanted to honor the images\u2019 Creative Commons licenses. As a result, each photo includes a numerical identifier that links back to the original Flickr photographer\u2019s account. In this way, The Times was able to trace many photos in the database to the people who took them.\n\u201cWhat the hell? That is bonkers,\u201d said Nick Alt, an entrepreneur in Los Angeles, when told his pictures were in the database, including photos he took of children at a public event in Playa Vista, Calif., a decade ago.\n\u201cThe reason I went to Flickr originally was that you could set the license to be noncommercial. Absolutely would I not have let my photos be used for machine-learning projects. I feel like such a schmuck for posting that picture. But I did it 13 years ago, before privacy was a thing.\u201d\nAnother subject, who asked to be identified as J., is now a 15-year-old high school sophomore in Las Vegas. Photos of him as a toddler are in the MegaFace database, thanks to his uncle\u2019s posting them to a Flickr album after a family reunion a decade ago. J. was incredulous that it wasn\u2019t illegal to put him in the database without his permission, and he is worried about the repercussions.\nSince middle school, he has been part of an Air Force Association program called CyberPatriot, which tries to steer young people with programming skills toward careers in cybersecurity. \u201cI\u2019m very protective of my digital footprint because of it,\u201d he said. \u201cI try not to post photos of myself online. What if I decide to work for the N.S.A.?\u201d\nFor J., Mr. Alt and most other Americans in the photos, there is little recourse. Privacy law is generally so permissive in the United States that companies are free to use millions of people\u2019s faces without their knowledge to power the spread of face-recognition technology. But there is an exception.\nIn 2008, Illinois passed a prescient law protecting the \u201cbiometric identifiers and biometric information\u201d of its residents. Two other states, Texas and Washington, went on to pass their own biometric privacy laws, but they aren\u2019t as robust as the one in Illinois, which strictly forbids private entities to collect, capture, purchase or otherwise obtain a person\u2019s biometrics \u2014 including a scan of their \u201cface geometry\u201d \u2014 without that person\u2019s consent.\n\u201cPhotos themselves are not covered by the Biometric Information Privacy Act, but the scan of the photos should be. The mere use of biometric data is a violation of the statute,\u201d said Faye Jones, a law professor at the University of Illinois. \u201cUsing that in an algorithmic contest when you haven\u2019t notified people is a violation of the law.\u201d\nIllinois residents like the Papas whose faceprints are used without their permission have the right to sue, said Ms. Jones, and are entitled to $1,000 per use, or $5,000 if the use was \u201creckless.\u201d The Times attempted to measure how many people from Illinois are in the MegaFace database; one approach, using self-reported location information, suggested 6,000 individuals, and another, using geotagging metadata, indicated as many as 13,000.\nTheir biometrics have likely been processed by dozens of companies. According to multiple legal experts in Illinois, the combined liability could add up to more than a billion dollars, and could form the basis of a class action.\n\u201cWe have plenty of ambitious class-action lawyers here in Illinois,\u201d said Jeffrey Widman, the managing partner at Fox Rothschild in Chicago. \u201cThe law\u2019s been on the books in Illinois since 2008 but was basically ignored for a decade. I guarantee you that in 2014 or 2015, this potential liability wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar. But the technology has now caught up with the law.\u201d\nA $35 billion case against Facebook\nIt\u2019s remarkable that the Illinois law even exists. According to Matthew Kugler, a law professor at Northwestern University who has researched the Illinois act, it was inspired by the 2007 bankruptcy of a company called Pay by Touch, which had the fingerprints of many Americans, including Illinoisans, on file; there were worries that it could sell them during its liquidation.\nNo one from the technology industry weighed in on the bill, according to legislative and lobbying records.\n\u201cWhen the law was passed, no one who is now concerned about it was thinking about the issue,\u201d Mr. Kugler said. Silicon Valley is aware of the law now. Bloomberg News reported in April 2018 that lobbyists for Google and Facebook were trying to weaken its provisions.\nMore than 200 class-action lawsuits alleging misuse of residents\u2019 biometrics have been filed in Illinois since 2015, including a $35 billion case against Facebook for using face recognition to tag people in photos. That lawsuit gained momentum in August, when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the company\u2019s arguments that the people did not suffer \u201cconcrete harm.\u201d\nIn recent years, technology companies have been treading more lightly in states with biometric legislation. When Google released a feature in 2018 that matched selfies to famous works of art, people in Illinois and Texas couldn\u2019t use it. And Google\u2019s Nest security cameras don\u2019t offer an otherwise standard feature for recognizing familiar faces in Illinois.\n\u201cIt\u2019s creepy that you found me. I always lived with the philosophy that what I put out there was public, but I couldn\u2019t have imagined this,\u201d said Wendy Piersall, a publisher and City Council member in Woodstock, Ill., whose photos, along with those of her three children, were in the MegaFace database.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t use the fun art app; why are you using our kids\u2019 faces to test your software?\u201d she added. \u201cMy photos there are geotagged to Illinois. It\u2019s not hard to figure out where these pictures were taken. I\u2019m not a sue-happy person, but I would cheer someone else on to go after this.\u201d\nPrivacy nihilism\nSome of the Illinois lawsuits have been settled or dismissed, but most are active, and Mr. Kugler, the Northwestern law professor, noted that basic legal questions remained unanswered. It\u2019s unclear what the legal liability would be for a company that takes photos uploaded in Illinois but processes the facial data in another state, or even another country.\n\u201cDefendants are going to be creative in searching for arguments, because no one wants to be stuck holding this expensive hot potato,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for Amazon Web Services said its use of the data set was \u201ccompliant with B.I.P.A.,\u201d while declining to explain how. Mario Fante, a spokesman for Philips, wrote in an email that the company \u201cwas never aware of any Illinois residents included in the above-mentioned data set.\u201d\nVictor Balta, a spokesman for the University of Washington, said, \u201cAll uses of photos in the researchers\u2019 database are lawful. The U.W. is a public research university, not a private entity, and the Illinois law targets private entities.\u201d\nSome of the Illinoisans we found in MegaFace and contacted were indifferent about the use of their faces.\n\u201cI do know that when you upload information online, it can be used in unexpected ways, so I guess I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Chris Scheufele, a web developer in Springfield. \u201cWhen you upload information to the internet and make it available for public consumption, you should expect it to be scraped.\u201d\nWhat about the subjects of his photos? Mr. Scheufele laughed. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to my wife about it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPrivacy nihilism\u201d is an increasingly familiar term for giving up on trying to control data about oneself in the digital era. What happened to Chloe Papa could, depending on your perspective, argue for extreme vigilance or total resignation: Who could have possibly predicted that a snapshot of a toddler in 2005 would contribute, a decade and a half later, to the development of bleeding-edge surveillance technology?\n\u201cWe have become accustomed to trading convenience for privacy, so that has dulled our senses as to what is happening with all the data gathered about us,\u201d said Ms. Jones, the law professor. \u201cBut people are starting to wake up.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

You Can Clean It Up, For a Price\nA new \u201cluxury internet\u201d is poised to make the online experience even more unequal than it already is.\nOnline Cesspool Got You Down?\nYou Can Clean It Up, for a Price\nA decade ago, an internet video start-up called Hulu boldly declared an end to the era of paid TV. The company announced that users would be able to watch their favorite shows over the internet, \u201canytime, anywhere, for free.\u201d\nUnderstandably, Hollywood types were taken aback. But in the \u201900s, free online TV, like free online everything else, seemed inevitable. Free was the internet\u2019s natural price, and anyone foolish enough to think they could still charge their customers was on the slow march toward extinction. Large newspapers were either pulling down their pay walls or not erecting them at all, giving in to the tech pioneer Stewart Brand\u2019s maxim that \u201cinformation wants to be free.\u201d Radiohead released a pay-what-you-want studio album, delighting the band\u2019s fans and raising eyebrows among music-industry executives. \u201cPractically everything web technology touches starts down the path to gratis,\u201d declared Wired magazine, which called free services \u201cthe future of business\u201d in a 2008 cover story.\nThe image of the internet as an egalitarian free-for-all \u2014 a place where no amount of money could buy you a superior experience, and where no lack of money could condemn you to an inferior one \u2014 persisted for years. Unlike the rest of consumer culture, the internet seemed immune to class division. Bill Gates used the same apps, visited the same websites and logged into the same social networks as the guy who mowed Bill Gates\u2019s lawn \u2014 at least in theory, anyway.\nAnd now? Well, check your credit-card statement. Today\u2019s internet is full of premium subscriptions, walled gardens and virtual V.I.P. rooms, all of which promise a cleaner, more pleasant experience than their free counterparts. The pay walls have been rebuilt, and the artists no longer work for tips. Hundreds of millions of people shell out for Netflix accounts, Patreon podcasts, Twitch streams, Spotify and news subscriptions. The average American spent more than $1,300 on digital media last year. Even Hulu pulled the plug on its free tier in 2016, giving users the choice of paying $7.99 a month or watching \u201cUgly Betty\u201d elsewhere.\n[Read about the power of Chinese apps.]\nBillions of people still use the free internet every day, of course. But it feels increasingly like wading into a sludge pit of algorithmically promoted misinformation, privacy-invading apps and subpar user experiences. Certainly not all of the internet\u2019s woes can be solved by paying your way out of them: There is no cleaner, well-lit version of Facebook in which calm policy discussions outperform racist memes, unless you count apps nobody uses. But there are more options than ever for sprucing up your digital surroundings.\nOne of these is Sift, a \u201cnews therapy\u201d app created by All Turtles, an artifical-intelligence studio based in San Francisco. The app, which costs $19.99 for six months, is billed as a way to \u201cstay informed about contentious topics while reducing anxiety and stress.\u201d Phil Libin, the chief executive of All Turtles, said the product was inspired by popular meditation apps like Calm and Headspace, as well as a desire to bring some serenity to the chaotic, sometimes overheated world of online news. \u201cI think it\u2019s becoming clear what things that are allegedly free actually cost,\u201d Libin told me. Many of the internet\u2019s cornerstone services, he added, \u201cjust seem to be more and more slimy and exploitative, and I think that people realize that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not surprising that given the choice between a free, seedy internet and a costly, orderly one, more people are opening their wallets. What is surprising is how quickly the mood has shifted. Paying for goods and services online used to mean you were an easy mark \u2014 someone too lazy or unsophisticated to figure out the necessary hacks and workarounds. Now, subscriptions are a status symbol. Models and influencers line up to join Raya, the $7.99-a-month, invitation-only dating app with an 8 percent acceptance rate and a wait list of more than 200,000 people. Image-conscious teenagers pay $19.99 a year for VSCO, which gives them more options for retouching their selfies. Class division has even come to virtual goods. A study by the Office of the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England found that Fortnite character skins \u2014 they\u2019re like costumes for your avatar \u2014 have become a source of social cachet for young kids. Poorer kids who use the free, default skin inside the game report being bullied by their peers who can afford to buy rarer ones.\nIn its early days, the internet was a great leveler. But we should have known better than to think it would stay that way. Free apps like Twitter and Facebook have become extractive mass-surveillance tools. And once the internet became the primary place where our identities are forged and performed, it was inevitable that some people would want to pay their way out of the panopticon \u2014 that escape from the very services we lusted after in recent memory would become a premium good.\nA few months ago, as research for an article, I started using a product called Superhuman, a $30-a-month email app that promises \u201cthe fastest email experience ever made.\u201d The app was a bold test of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay hundreds of dollars a year for what amounted to a fancy Gmail overlay. It enables some helpful keyboard shortcuts and some cool, if creepy, features like email tracking. I wound up feeling that Superhuman was a good product, but its premium price seemed destined to keep it a niche product for the expense-account crowd. Instead, it spawned a trend.\n\u201cI hear a new \u2018Superhuman for X\u2019 pitch every week,\u201d Jeff Morris Jr., a Los Angeles tech investor, told me recently. Morris rattled off a list of the imitators he has seen: Woven, the Superhuman for calendars; Mighty, the Superhuman for web browsers; Clay, the Superhuman for address books; and a half-dozen more ultrapremium apps aimed at the same Soylent-drinking, productivity-hacking \u201cprosumer\u201d market. Some of these apps offer concierge-level support and lengthy wait lists \u2014 Silicon Valley\u2019s answer to the lines outside Supreme.\nMorris characterized the earlier, more egalitarian internet as a historical anomaly, akin to the days before cable TV, when the Big Three had to make shows aimed at a broad mass market because there was no way to target narrower segments of consumers. The growth of the free, mass internet, he said, created a desire for more intimate-feeling products aimed at smaller, more elite markets. Companies had become as discerning as consumers about the tools they used, he said, and the desire to have the best possible tools created a \u201cFOMO flywheel\u201d of demand for high-end products. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had Louis Vuitton handbags,\u201d Morris explained. \u201cNow you have software that makes you feel the same way.\u201d\n\u2018You\u2019ve always had Louis Vuitton handbags. Now you have software that makes you feel the same way.\u2019\nBut unlike with a Louis Vuitton bag, the appeal of these products isn\u2019t to get you noticed \u2014 it\u2019s the opposite. People who register domain names at GoDaddy can pay $7.99 extra per year to hide their personal information from searches; virtual private networks, some costing $10 or so a month, offer an additional layer of security by masking your location and encrypting your browsing activity. True privacy hawks can spring for a premium service like Safe Shepherd or OneRep, which scour online directories for your personal information and try to have it removed. Short of moving to a mountain hideaway, there is no way to escape tracking altogether, but if you can afford it, you can draw the curtains a bit.\nBuying more expensive hardware generally helps, too. A study by Douglas Schmidt, a professor at Vanderbilt University, found that Android phones \u2014 which cost roughly one-third as much as iPhones, on average \u2014 collect roughly 10 times as much personal data. (Google has disputed the study\u2019s accuracy.) Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, has been using the iPhone\u2019s privacy features as a selling point for years, calling privacy a \u201chuman right\u201d and taking shots at Google and Facebook for their ad-supported business models. At an event in March, he announced that the company\u2019s premium news app, Apple News Plus, would offer high-quality content from hundreds of leading publishers for a flat $9.99 monthly fee. Then, in one of the biggest applause lines of the day, he revealed that in addition to getting high-quality content, users of this new service would not be subject to surveillance. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what you read!\u201d Cook exclaimed. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t allow advertisers to track you!\u201d\nApple\u2019s rivals quickly pointed out that not everyone can afford a $1,000 iPhone. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed that \u201cprivacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg has dismissed the idea of a paid, ad-free Facebook, saying, \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe that very many people would like to pay to not have ads.\u201d These positions are self-serving, of course \u2014 a subscription-based Google or Facebook might be a much less profitable one. But they\u2019re not wrong to suggest that if privacy becomes an expensive add-on, the rich and the poor will have very different experiences of the internet.\nOne recent afternoon, I was watching some astrophysics lectures on YouTube \u2014 O.K., fine, it was an A.S.M.R. video of a guy eating chalk \u2014 when I was shown an ad for The Epoch Times, an English-language publisher funded by the persecuted Falun Gong religious sect, which is stridently anti-Beijing and supportive of right-wing politicians in the West. The ad, a lengthy diatribe about why President Trump\u2019s notional scheme to buy Greenland was a stroke of strategic genius, was full of misinformation and hyperpartisan talking points. After it finished, I got an ad for a get-rich-quick house-flipping seminar. Later, a banner appeared, telling me I could make these ads, and all other ads, go away if I paid $11.99 a month to subscribe to YouTube Premium. I\u2019d seen the banner hundreds of times before, but in the moment, it felt vaguely like extortion \u2014 as if $11.99 was the price not just of uninterrupted entertainment but also of fencing off my brain from low-rent scammers and opportunists.\nThe tech investor Marc Andreessen once said that in the future, there will be two types of people: \u201cpeople who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.\u201d It was a prescient prediction, but not in the way Andreessen meant it. He imagined a society in which computer programmers would rule over the analog masses. What\u2019s happening instead is something much less revolutionary: The programmers simply built the machines that let big corporations, powerful politicians and savvy media manipulators tell other people what to do, and they are letting rich people pay to turn those machines off.\nAs the internet moves to an A.I.-driven future, many services we use every day could learn to manipulate us in entirely new ways. In that sense, the free internet may further erode our free will. Lizzie O\u2019Shea, a technology historian and lawyer, wrote in The New Republic this year that the data mining required by the ad-supported internet amounts to \u201ca coup on our consciousness; a takeover of the parts of us that we instinctively believe ought to be under our control.\u201d A YouTube algorithm that shows you political propaganda is one thing; a YouTube algorithm that learns to personalize propaganda tailored to your specific psychological profile is another.\nTheoretically, new A.I. start-ups could compete with the giants over privacy and respect for user autonomy. But investors aren\u2019t holding their breath. \u201cIf software is meritocratic, A.I. is feudal,\u201d said Nick Beim, a partner at the venture-capital firm Venrock, which invests in A.I. start-ups. He has found that A.I. is an uphill battle for new entrants into the field, and not just because the technology is complicated. \u201cIts power depends on how much data you have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when it comes to data ownership, the large internet platforms are in a dramatically different league than everyone else.\u201d\nThe ad-based model that powers the free internet could even extend into physical spaces, as technologies like self-driving cars look for a sustaining business model. Already, Google has taken out a patent on a system that would allow advertisers to subsidize passengers\u2019 rides to their businesses. Start-ups have developed tools that would allow advertisers to suggest detours midride. (\u201cThere is an Outback Steakhouse 1.2 miles away from your destination. Would you like to stop there in exchange for a free ride today?\u201d) Several large tech companies have begun working on brain-computer interface systems that can turn thoughts into typed speech by using implanted electrodes. Facebook, which presented impressive progress this year on its own brain-reading technology, has not ruled out using this technology for advertising purposes.\nSo far, most of our hand-wringing about \u201cfilter bubbles\u201d and algorithmic sorting has taken place in the context of partisan politics. We find it disturbing that liberals and conservatives see such different news stories in their Twitter feeds, or that Google results are tailored to our preferences. But we have not fully appreciated how much of our internet experience is shaped by socioeconomic status, and the magnitude of the tax the internet imposes on lower-income users in the form of data-sucking devices and predatory ads.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you might be one of the lucky ones. Maybe you\u2019re a paying Times subscriber, or maybe you\u2019re Facebook friends with someone who is. Maybe, like me, you have an ad blocker installed on an Apple device that protects your data, you manage your browser\u2019s privacy settings carefully and you weigh the trade-offs of putting devices like the Amazon Echo in your home. But if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re already on one side of what looks to be a growing divide. And we should not confuse this version of the internet for the primary one.\nWhat the internet once promised was nothing short of complete informational equality, so that a child in Chennai would have access to the same knowledge as a child in Cleveland. But today\u2019s internet functions a lot like the physical world, with an income-based hierarchy in which everything, from the cleanliness of the water to the quality of the schools, is determined by how much you can afford to pay. It\u2019s hardly the communitarian utopia we were promised. In its current form, in fact, it threatens to exacerbate inequality and accelerate the centripetal forces already fragmenting our society.\nRumman Chowdhury, who leads Accenture\u2019s responsible-A.I. practice, put it in stark terms. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the kind of car you drive,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about your fundamental ability to function in society \u2014 what jobs your children will get when they grow up, what access to information they have. Quite literally, we\u2019re talking about how you view the world.\u201d\nKevin Roose is a technology columnist for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.

They provide an unprecedented inside view of the continuing clampdown in Xinjiang, in which the authorities have corralled as many as a million ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and others into internment camps and prisons over the past three years.\nRead the Full Document: What Chinese Officials Told Children Whose Families Were Put in Camps\nThe party has rejected international criticism of the camps and described them as job-training centers that use mild methods to fight Islamic extremism. But the documents confirm the coercive nature of the crackdown in the words and orders of the very officials who conceived and orchestrated it.\nEven as the government presented its efforts in Xinjiang to the public as benevolent and unexceptional, it discussed and organized a ruthless and extraordinary campaign in these internal communications. Senior party leaders are recorded ordering drastic and urgent action against extremist violence, including the mass detentions, and discussing the consequences with cool detachment.\nChildren saw their parents taken away, students wondered who would pay their tuition and crops could not be planted or harvested for lack of manpower, the reports noted. Yet officials were directed to tell people who complained to be grateful for the Communist Party\u2019s help and stay quiet.\nThe leaked papers offer a striking picture of how the hidden machinery of the Chinese state carried out the country\u2019s most far-reaching internment campaign since the Mao era. The key disclosures in the documents include:\n\u2022 President Xi Jinping, the party chief, laid the groundwork for the crackdown in a series of speeches delivered in private to officials during and after a visit to Xinjiang in April 2014, just weeks after Uighur militants stabbed more than 150 people at a train station, killing 31. Mr. Xi called for an all-out \u201cstruggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism\u201d using the \u201corgans of dictatorship,\u201d and showing \u201cabsolutely no mercy.\u201d\n\u2022 Terrorist attacks abroad and the drawdown of American troops in Afghanistan heightened the leadership\u2019s fears and helped shape the crackdown. Officials argued that attacks in Britain resulted from policies that put \u201chuman rights above security,\u201d and Mr. Xi urged the party to emulate aspects of America\u2019s \u201cwar on terror\u201d after the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\u2022 The internment camps in Xinjiang expanded rapidly after the appointment in August 2016 of Chen Quanguo, a zealous new party boss for the region. He distributed Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches to justify the campaign and exhorted officials to \u201cround up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d\n\u2022 The crackdown encountered doubts and resistance from local officials who feared it would exacerbate ethnic tensions and stifle economic growth. Mr. Chen responded by purging officials suspected of standing in his way, including one county leader who was jailed after quietly releasing thousands of inmates from the camps.\nThe leaked papers consist of 24 documents, some of which contain duplicated material. They include nearly 200 pages of internal speeches by Mr. Xi and other leaders, and more than 150 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang. There are also references to plans to extend restrictions on Islam to other parts of China.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and\ncontrol of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance\nand control of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of\ninternal speeches by Mr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by\nother officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports\non the surveillance and control of\nthe Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal\ninvestigations into local officials.\nThe documents include 96 pages\nof internal speeches by Mr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by\nother officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports\non the surveillance and control of\nthe Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from\ninternal investigations into local\nofficials.\nThe documents include 96 pages of internal speeches by\nMr. Xi,\n102 pages of internal speeches by other officials,\n161 pages of directives and reports on the surveillance and\ncontrol of the Uighur population in Xinjiang\nand 44 pages of material from internal investigations\ninto local officials.\nThough it is unclear how the documents were gathered and selected, the leak suggests greater discontent inside the party apparatus over the crackdown than previously known. The papers were brought to light by a member of the Chinese political establishment who requested anonymity and expressed hope that their disclosure would prevent party leaders, including Mr. Xi, from escaping culpability for the mass detentions.\nThe Chinese leadership wraps policymaking in secrecy, especially when it comes to Xinjiang, a resource-rich territory located on the sensitive frontier with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia. Predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups make up more than half the region\u2019s population of 25 million. The largest of these groups are the Uighurs, who speak a Turkic language and have long faced discrimination and restrictions on cultural and religious activities.\nBeijing has sought for decades to suppress Uighur resistance to Chinese rule in Xinjiang. The current crackdown began after a surge of antigovernment and anti-Chinese violence, including ethnic riots in 2009 in Urumqi, the regional capital, and a May 2014 attack on an outdoor market that killed 39 people just days before Mr. Xi convened a leadership conference in Beijing to set a new policy course for Xinjiang.\nSince 2017, the authorities in Xinjiang have detained many hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in internment camps. Inmates undergo months or years of indoctrination and interrogation aimed at transforming them into secular and loyal supporters of the party.\nOf the 24 documents, the directive on how to handle minority students returning home to Xinjiang in the summer of 2017 offers the most detailed discussion of the indoctrination camps \u2014 and the clearest illustration of the regimented way the party told the public one story while mobilizing around a much harsher narrative internally.\nEven as the document advises officials to inform students that their relatives are receiving \u201ctreatment\u201d for exposure to radical Islam, its title refers to family members who are being \u201cdealt with,\u201d or chuzhi, a euphemism used in party documents to mean punishment.\nOfficials in Turpan, a city in eastern Xinjiang, drafted the question-and-answer script after the regional government warned local officials to prepare for the returning students. The agency coordinating efforts to \u201cmaintain stability\u201d across Xinjiang then distributed the guide across the region and urged officials to use it as a model.\nThe government sends Xinjiang\u2019s brightest young Uighurs to universities across China, with the goal of training a new generation of Uighur civil servants and teachers loyal to the party.\nThe crackdown has been so extensive that it affected even these elite students, the directive shows. And that made the authorities nervous.\n\u201cReturning students from other parts of China have widespread social ties across the entire country,\u201d the directive noted. \u201cThe moment they issue incorrect opinions on WeChat, Weibo and other social media platforms, the impact is widespread and difficult to eradicate.\u201d\nThe authorities anticipated, however, that this was unlikely to mollify students and provided replies to a series of other questions: When will my relatives be released? If this is for training, why can\u2019t they come home? Can they request a leave? How will I afford school if my parents are studying and there is no one to work on the farm?\nThe guide recommended increasingly firm replies telling the students that their relatives had been \u201cinfected\u201d by the \u201cvirus\u201d of Islamic radicalism and must be quarantined and cured. Even grandparents and family members who seemed too old to carry out violence could not be spared, officials were directed to say.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t undergo study and training, they\u2019ll never thoroughly and fully understand the dangers of religious extremism,\u201d one answer said, citing the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State. \u201cNo matter what age, anyone who has been infected by religious extremism must undergo study.\u201d\nStudents should be grateful that the authorities had taken their relatives away, the document said.\n\u201cTreasure this chance for free education that the party and government has provided to thoroughly eradicate erroneous thinking, and also learn Chinese and job skills,\u201d one answer said. \u201cThis offers a great foundation for a happy life for your family.\u201d\nThe authorities appear to be using a scoring system to determine who can be released from the camps: The document instructed officials to tell the students that their behavior could hurt their relatives\u2019 scores, and to assess the daily behavior of the students and record their attendance at training sessions, meetings and other activities.\nSecret Speeches\nThe ideas driving the mass detentions can be traced back to Xi Jinping\u2019s first and only visit to Xinjiang as China\u2019s leader, a tour shadowed by violence.\nIn 2014, little more than a year after becoming president, he spent four days in the region, and on the last day of the trip, two Uighur militants staged a suicide bombing outside a train station in Urumqi that injured nearly 80 people, one fatally.\nWeeks earlier, militants with knives had gone on a rampage at another railway station, in southwest China, killing 31 people and injuring more than 140. And less than a month after Mr. Xi\u2019s visit, assailants tossed explosives into a vegetable market in Urumqi, wounding 94 people and killing at least 39.\nAgainst this backdrop of bloodshed, Mr. Xi delivered a series of secret speeches setting the hard-line course that culminated in the security offensive now underway in Xinjiang. While state media have alluded to these speeches, none were made public.\nThe text of four of them, though, were among the leaked documents \u2014 and they provide a rare, unfiltered look at the origins of the crackdown and the beliefs of the man who set it in motion.\n\u201cThe methods that our comrades have at hand are too primitive,\u201d Mr. Xi said in one talk, after inspecting a counterterrorism police squad in Urumqi. \u201cNone of these weapons is any answer for their big machete blades, ax heads and cold steel weapons.\u201d\n\u201cWe must be as harsh as them,\u201d he added, \u201cand show absolutely no mercy.\u201d\nIn free-flowing monologues in Xinjiang and at a subsequent leadership conference on Xinjiang policy in Beijing, Mr. Xi is recorded thinking through what he called a crucial national security issue and laying out his ideas for a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d in the region.\nAlthough he did not order mass detentions in these speeches, he called on the party to unleash the tools of \u201cdictatorship\u201d to eradicate radical Islam in Xinjiang.\nMr. Xi displayed a fixation with the issue that seemed to go well beyond his public remarks on the subject. He likened Islamic extremism alternately to a virus-like contagion and a dangerously addictive drug, and declared that addressing it would require \u201ca period of painful, interventionary treatment.\u201d\n\u201cThe psychological impact of extremist religious thought on people must never be underestimated,\u201d Mr. Xi told officials in Urumqi on April 30, 2014, the final day of his trip to Xinjiang. \u201cPeople who are captured by religious extremism \u2014 male or female, old or young \u2014 have their consciences destroyed, lose their humanity and murder without blinking an eye.\u201d\nIn another speech, at the leadership conclave in Beijing a month later, he warned of \u201cthe toxicity of religious extremism.\u201d\n\u201cAs soon as you believe in it,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s like taking a drug, and you lose your sense, go crazy and will do anything.\u201d\nIn several surprising passages, given the crackdown that followed, Mr. Xi also told officials to not discriminate against Uighurs and to respect their right to worship. He warned against overreacting to natural friction between Uighurs and Han Chinese, the nation\u2019s dominant ethnic group, and rejected proposals to try to eliminate Islam entirely in China.\n\u201cIn light of separatist and terrorist forces under the banner of Islam, some people have argued that Islam should be restricted or even eradicated,\u201d he said during the Beijing conference. He called that view \u201cbiased, even wrong.\u201d\nBut Mr. Xi\u2019s main point was unmistakable: He was leading the party in a sharp turn toward greater repression in Xinjiang.\nBefore Mr. Xi, the party had often described attacks in Xinjiang as the work of a few fanatics inspired and orchestrated by shadowy separatist groups abroad. But Mr. Xi argued that Islamic extremism had taken root across swaths of Uighur society.\nIn fact, the vast majority of Uighurs adhere to moderate traditions, though some began embracing more conservative and more public religious practices in the 1990s, despite state controls on Islam. Mr. Xi\u2019s remarks suggest he was alarmed by the revival of public piety. He blamed lax controls on religion, suggesting that his predecessors had let down their guard.\nWhile previous Chinese leaders emphasized economic development to stifle unrest in Xinjiang, Mr. Xi said that was not enough. He demanded an ideological cure, an effort to rewire the thinking of the region\u2019s Muslim minorities.\n\u201cThe weapons of the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering,\u201d Mr. Xi told the leadership conference on Xinjiang policy, which convened six days after the deadly attack on the vegetable market.\nThe Soviet Prism\nMr. Xi is the son of an early Communist Party leader who in the 1980s supported more relaxed policies toward ethnic minority groups, and some analysts had expected he might follow his father\u2019s milder ways when he assumed leadership of the party in November 2012.\nBut the speeches underscore how Mr. Xi sees risks to China through the prism of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he blamed on ideological laxity and spineless leadership.\nAcross China, he set about eliminating challenges to party rule; dissidents and human rights lawyers disappeared in waves of arrests. In Xinjiang, he pointed to examples from the former Soviet bloc to argue that economic growth would not immunize a society against ethnic separatism.\nThe Baltic republics were among the most developed in the Soviet Union but also the first to leave when the country broke up, he told the leadership conference. Yugoslavia\u2019s relative prosperity did not prevent its disintegration either, he added.\n\u201cWe say that development is the top priority and the basis for achieving lasting security, and that\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cBut it would be wrong to believe that with development every problem solves itself.\u201d\nIn the speeches, Mr. Xi showed a deep familiarity with the history of Uighur resistance to Chinese rule, or at least Beijing\u2019s official version of it, and discussed episodes rarely if ever mentioned by Chinese leaders in public, including brief periods of Uighur self-rule in the first half of the 20th century.\nViolence by Uighur militants has never threatened Communist control of the region. Though attacks grew deadlier after 2009, when nearly 200 people died in ethnic riots in Urumqi, they remained relatively small, scattered and unsophisticated.\nEven so, Mr. Xi warned that the violence was spilling from Xinjiang into other parts of China and could taint the party\u2019s image of strength. Unless the threat was extinguished, Mr. Xi told the leadership conference, \u201csocial stability will suffer shocks, the general unity of people of every ethnicity will be damaged, and the broad outlook for reform, development and stability will be affected.\u201d\nSetting aside diplomatic niceties, he traced the origins of Islamic extremism in Xinjiang to the Middle East, and warned that turmoil in Syria and Afghanistan would magnify the risks for China. Uighurs had traveled to both countries, he said, and could return to China as seasoned fighters seeking an independent homeland, which they called East Turkestan.\n\u201cAfter the United States pulls troops out of Afghanistan, terrorist organizations positioned on the frontiers of Afghanistan and Pakistan may quickly infiltrate into Central Asia,\u201d Mr. Xi said. \u201cEast Turkestan\u2019s terrorists who have received real-war training in Syria and Afghanistan could at any time launch terrorist attacks in Xinjiang.\u201d\nMr. Xi\u2019s predecessor, Hu Jintao, responded to the 2009 riots in Urumqi with a clampdown but he also stressed economic development as a cure for ethnic discontent \u2014 longstanding party policy. But Mr. Xi signaled a break with Mr. Hu\u2019s approach in the speeches.\n\u201cIn recent years, Xinjiang has grown very quickly and the standard of living has consistently risen, but even so ethnic separatism and terrorist violence have still been on the rise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis goes to show that economic development does not automatically bring lasting order and security.\u201d\nEnsuring stability in Xinjiang would require a sweeping campaign of surveillance and intelligence gathering to root out resistance in Uighur society, Mr. Xi argued.\nHe said new technology must be part of the solution, foreshadowing the party\u2019s deployment of facial recognition, genetic testing and big data in Xinjiang. But he also emphasized old-fashioned methods, such as neighborhood informants, and urged officials to study how Americans responded to the Sept. 11 attacks.\nLike the United States, he said, China \u201cmust make the public an important resource in protecting national security.\u201d\n\u201cWe Communists should be naturals at fighting a people\u2019s war,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the best at organizing for a task.\u201d\nThe only suggestion in these speeches that Mr. Xi envisioned the internment camps now at the heart of the crackdown was an endorsement of more intense indoctrination programs in Xinjiang\u2019s prisons.\n\u201cThere must be effective educational remolding and transformation of criminals,\u201d he told officials in southern Xinjiang on the second day of his trip. \u201cAnd even after these people are released, their education and transformation must continue.\u201d\nWithin months, indoctrination sites began opening across Xinjiang \u2014 mostly small facilities at first, which held dozens or hundreds of Uighurs at a time for sessions intended to pressure them into disavowing devotion to Islam and professing gratitude for the party.\nThen in August 2016, a hard-liner named Chen Quanguo was transferred from Tibet to govern Xinjiang. Within weeks, he called on local officials to \u201cremobilize\u201d around Mr. Xi\u2019s goals and declared that Mr. Xi\u2019s speeches \u201cset the direction for making a success of Xinjiang.\u201d\nNew security controls and a drastic expansion of the indoctrination camps followed.\nThe crackdown appears to have smothered violent unrest in Xinjiang, but many experts have warned that the extreme security measures and mass detentions are likely to breed resentment that could eventually inspire worse ethnic clashes.\nThe camps have been condemned in Washington and other foreign capitals. As early as the May 2014 leadership conference, though, Mr. Xi anticipated international criticism and urged officials behind closed doors to ignore it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid if hostile forces whine, or if hostile forces malign the image of Xinjiang,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Round Up Everyone\u2019\nThe documents show there was more resistance to the crackdown inside the party than previously known \u2014 and highlight the key role that the new party boss in Xinjiang played in overcoming it.\nMr. Chen led a campaign akin to one of Mao\u2019s turbulent political crusades, in which top-down pressure on local officials encouraged overreach and any expression of doubt was treated as a crime.\nIn February 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at attention in a vast square in Urumqi to prepare for a \u201csmashing, obliterating offensive.\u201d In the following weeks, the documents indicate, the leadership settled on plans to detain Uighurs in large numbers.\nMr. Chen issued a sweeping order: \u201cRound up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d The vague phrase appears repeatedly in internal documents from 2017.\nThe party had previously used the phrase \u2014 \u201cying shou jin shou\u201d in Chinese \u2014 when demanding that officials be vigilant and comprehensive in collecting taxes or measuring harvests. Now it was being applied to humans in directives that ordered, with no mention of judicial procedures, the detention of anyone who displayed \u201csymptoms\u201d of religious radicalism or antigovernment views.\nThe authorities laid out dozens of such signs, including common behavior among devout Uighurs such as wearing long beards, giving up smoking or drinking, studying Arabic and praying outside mosques.\nParty leaders reinforced the orders with warnings about terrorism abroad and potential copycat attacks in China.\nThe number of people swept into the camps remains a closely guarded secret. But one of the leaked documents offers a hint of the scale of the campaign: It instructed officials to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in crowded facilities.\n\u2018I Broke the Rules\u2019\nThe orders were especially urgent and contentious in Yarkand County, a collection of rural towns and villages in southern Xinjiang where nearly all of the 900,000 residents are Uighur.\nIn the 2014 speeches, Mr. Xi had singled out southern Xinjiang as the front line in his fight against religious extremism. Uighurs make up close to 90 percent of the population in the south, compared to just under half in Xinjiang over all, and Mr. Xi set a long-term goal of attracting more Han Chinese settlers.\nHe and other party leaders ordered a quasi-military organization, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to accelerate efforts to settle the area with more Han Chinese, the documents show.\nA few months later, more than 100 Uighur militants armed with axes and knives attacked a government office and police station in Yarkand, killing 37 people, according to government reports. In the battle, the security forces shot dead 59 assailants, the reports said.\nAn official named Wang Yongzhi was appointed to run Yarkand soon afterward. With his glasses and crew cut, he looked the picture of a party technocrat. He had grown up and spent his career in southern Xinjiang and was seen as a deft, seasoned official who could deliver on the party\u2019s top priorities in the area: economic development and firm control of the Uighurs.\nBut among the most revealing documents in the leaked papers are two that describe Mr. Wang\u2019s downfall \u2014 an 11-page report summarizing the party\u2019s internal investigation into his actions, and the text of a 15-page confession that he may have given under duress. Both were distributed inside the party as a warning to officials to fall in line behind the crackdown.\nHan officials like Mr. Wang serve as the party\u2019s anchors in southern Xinjiang, watching over Uighur officials in more junior positions, and he seemed to enjoy the blessing of top leaders, including Yu Zhengsheng, then China\u2019s most senior official for ethnic issues, who visited the county in 2015.\nMr. Wang set about beefing up security in Yarkand but he also pushed economic development to address ethnic discontent. And he sought to soften the party\u2019s religious policies, declaring that there was nothing wrong with having a Quran at home and encouraging party officials to read it to better understand Uighur traditions.\nWhen the mass detentions began, Mr. Wang did as he was told at first and appeared to embrace the task with zeal.\nHe built two sprawling new detention facilities, including one as big as 50 basketball courts, and herded 20,000 people into them.\nHe sharply increased funding for the security forces in 2017, more than doubling spending on outlays such as checkpoints and surveillance to 1.37 billion renminbi, or about $180 million.\nAnd he lined up party members for a rally in a public square and urged them to press the fight against terrorists. \u201cWipe them out completely,\u201d he said. \u201cDestroy them root and branch.\u201d\nBut privately, Mr. Wang had misgivings, according to the confession that he later signed, which would have been carefully vetted by the party.\nHe was under intense pressure to prevent an outburst of violence in Yarkand, and worried the crackdown would provoke a backlash.\nThe authorities set numeric targets for Uighur detentions in parts of Xinjiang, and while it is unclear if they did so in Yarkand, Mr. Wang felt the orders left no room for moderation and would poison ethnic relations in the county.\nHe also worried that the mass detentions would make it impossible to record the economic progress he needed to earn a promotion.\nThe leadership had set goals to reduce poverty in Xinjiang. But with so many working-age residents being sent to the camps, Mr. Wang was afraid the targets would be out of reach, along with his hopes for a better job.\nHis superiors, he wrote, were \u201coverly ambitious and unrealistic.\u201d\n\u201cThe policies and measures taken by higher levels were at gaping odds with realities on the ground and could not be implemented in full,\u201d he added.\nTo help enforce the crackdown in southern Xinjiang, Mr. Chen transferred in hundreds of officials from the north. Publicly, Mr. Wang welcomed the 62 assigned to Yarkand. Privately, he seethed that they did not understand how to work with local officials and residents.\nThe pressure on officials in Xinjiang to detain Uighurs and prevent fresh violence was relentless, and Mr. Wang said in the confession \u2014 presumably signed under pressure \u2014 that he drank on the job. He described one episode in which he collapsed drunk during a meeting on security.\n\u201cWhile reporting on my work in the afternoon meeting, I rambled incoherently,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d just spoken a few sentences and my head collapsed on the table. It became the biggest joke across the whole prefecture.\u201d\nThousands of officials in Xinjiang were punished for resisting or failing to carry out the crackdown with sufficient zeal. Uighur officials were accused of protecting fellow Uighurs, and Gu Wensheng, the Han leader of another southern county, was jailed for trying to slow the detentions and shield Uighur officials, according to the documents.\nSecret teams of investigators traveled across the region identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang for infractions in the \u201cfight against separatism,\u201d more than 20 times the figure in the previous year, according to official statistics.\nMr. Wang may have gone further than any other official.\nQuietly, he ordered the release of more than 7,000 camp inmates \u2014 an act of defiance for which he would be detained, stripped of power and prosecuted.\nBrazen Defiance\nMr. Wang quietly disappeared from public view after September 2017.\nAbout six months later, the party made an example of him, announcing that he was being investigated for \u201cgravely disobeying the party central leadership\u2019s strategy for governing Xinjiang.\u201d\nThe internal report on the investigation was more direct. \u201cHe should have given his all to serving the party,\u201d it said. \u201cInstead, he ignored the party central leadership\u2019s strategy for Xinjiang, and he went as far as brazen defiance.\u201d\nBoth the report and Mr. Wang\u2019s confession were read aloud to officials across Xinjiang. The message was plain: The party would not tolerate any hesitation in carrying out the mass detentions.\nPropaganda outlets described Mr. Wang as irredeemably corrupt, and the internal report accused him of taking bribes on construction and mining deals and paying off superiors to win promotions.\nThe authorities also emphasized he was no friend of Uighurs. To hit poverty-reduction targets, he was said to have forced 1,500 families to move into unheated apartments in the middle of the winter. Some villagers burned wood indoors to keep warm, leading to injuries and deaths, his confession said.\nBut Mr. Wang\u2019s greatest political sin was not revealed to the public. Instead, the authorities hid it in the internal report.\n\u201cHe refused,\u201d it said, \u201cto round up everyone who should be rounded up.\u201d\nDesign and development by Rebecca Lieberman.

No one is beyond the reach of this constant digital surveillance. Not even the president of the United States.\nThe Times Privacy Project obtained a dataset with more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million people in this country. It was a random sample from 2016 and 2017, but it took only minutes \u2014 with assistance from publicly available information \u2014 for us to deanonymize location data and track the whereabouts of President Trump.\nA single dot appeared on the screen, representing the precise location of someone in President Trump\u2019s entourage at 7:10 a.m. It lingered around the grounds of the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president was staying, for about an hour.\nThen it was on the move.\nThe dot traveled to the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, about 30 minutes north of the hotel, pinging again at 9:24 a.m. just outside the compound. The president was there to play golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.\nThere the dot stayed until at least 1:12 p.m., when it moved to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where the world leaders enjoyed a private lunch.\nBy 5:08 p.m., the phone was back at Mar-a-Lago.\nThe president had what he called a working dinner with Mr. Abe that night.\nThe device\u2019s owner was easy to trace, revealing the outline of the person\u2019s work and life. The same phone pinged a dozen times at the nearby Secret Service field office and events with elected officials. From computer screens more than 1,000 miles away, we could watch the person travel from exclusive areas at Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago.\n[Related: Where Even the Children Are Being Tracked \u2014 We followed every move of people in one city.

Connecting the home to public deeds revealed the person\u2019s name, along with the name of the person\u2019s spouse, exposing even more details about both families. We could also see other stops this person made, apparently more connected with his private life than his public duties. The Secret Service declined to comment on our findings or describe its policies regarding location data.\nThe vulnerability of the person we tracked in Mr. Trump\u2019s entourage is one that many if not all of us share: the apps (weather services, maps, perhaps even something as mundane as a coupon saver) collecting and sharing his location on his phone.\nAmericans have grown eerily accustomed to being tracked throughout their digital lives. But it\u2019s far from their fault. It\u2019s a result of a system in which data surveillance practices are hidden from consumers and in which much of the collection of information is done without the full knowledge of the device holders.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nFor the nation\u2019s security agencies, however, privacy is critical to the safety of military, defense and security operations across the country and abroad. If threats to that privacy have seemed abstract in the past, the trove of location data we have analyzed has brought them into sharp relief. Military and intelligence officials have long been concerned about how their movements could be exposed; now every move is. As a senior Defense Department official told Times Opinion, even the Pentagon has told employees to expect that their privacy is compromised:\n\u201cWe want our people to understand: They should make no assumptions about anonymity. You are not anonymous on this planet at this point in our existence. Everyone is trackable, traceable, discoverable to some degree.\u201d\nWe were able to track smartphones in nearly every major government building and facility in Washington. We could follow them back to homes and, ultimately, their owners\u2019 true identities. Even a prominent senator\u2019s national security adviser \u2014 someone for whom privacy and security are core to their every working day \u2014 was identified and tracked in the data.\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhite House\nF.B.I.\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nSupreme Court\nCapitol Building\nWhile the Constitution prevents companies from sharing location data with the government without a warrant, there are no federal protections limiting how they use or share it privately. No such protections are currently being debated before Congress \u2014 even though we found that we could track people through Congress\u2019s own halls as easily as any place else.\nWhen we reached out to some lawmakers to show what we found, the outrage proved bipartisan.\n\u201cThis is terrifying,\u201d said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for the federal government take a tougher stance with tech companies. \u201cIt is terrifying not just because of the major national security implications, what Beijing could get ahold of. But it also raises personal privacy concerns for individuals and families. These companies are tracking our kids.\u201d\n\u201cTech companies are profiting by spying on Americans \u2014 trampling on the right to privacy and risking our national security,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, told us. \u201cThey are throwing around their power to undermine our democracy with zero consequences. This report is another alarming case for why we need to break up big tech, adopt serious privacy regulations and hold top executives of these companies personally responsible.\u201d\nAgencies can limit how their employees use location-sharing apps and services, but that doesn\u2019t mean those guidelines will be strictly enforced \u2014 or extended to personal devices.\nBut no matter how comprehensive an organization\u2019s policies and regulations are, getting everyone to follow them is nearly impossible as many of these apps' surveillance practices are not visible to consumers.\n\u201cThe human being is the weak link,\u201d said Martijn Rasser, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who is now a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to enforce a lot of these rules and regulations. Sometimes, all it takes is one person to violate the rules to completely negate the purpose of having those rules in the first place.\u201d\nDespite the sensitivity of this information, it is put to everyday use. Packaged with millions of other data points, location information is turned into marketing analysis and sold to financial institutions, real estate investors, advertising companies and others. Companies say they vet partners carefully and tend to work with larger players that have a clear business case for receiving the data.\nLike all data, the vast location files are vulnerable to hacks, leaks or sale at any point along that process. The data we reviewed was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so.\nMultiple experts with ties to the United States\u2019 national security agencies warned in interviews that foreign actors like Russia, North Korea, China and other adversaries may be working to steal, buy or otherwise obtain this kind of data. Only months ago, hackers working for the Chinese government allegedly targeted location data for people moving throughout Asia by breaking into telecom networks, according to a report by Reuters.\n\u201cPeople literally go to work every day, sit down at a desk, check the sports, send an email or two to their girlfriend and then start looking for databases they can steal,\u201d said James Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. \u201cThey just do that 9 to 5, every day.\u201d\nThe American government may conduct similar intelligence operations against its adversaries, experts said, though under stricter legal frameworks.\nUsing the data, we identified people in positions of power by following smartphone pings as they moved around the White House, Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court and other government facilities. In many cases, the data trails led back to the smartphone users\u2019 homes. In this series, we did not name any of the identified people without their permission. And the data below has been obscured to protect device owners.\nSenior Officials and Security Staff\nData has been obscured to protect device owners.\nSecret Service agent\nSecret Service agent\nTechnology at the Supreme Court\nDepartment of Defense official\nDirector at a House committee\nAdvisor for a Senator\nConnecting a ping to a person was as easy as combining home and work locations with public information. A seemingly random set of movements turned into a clear individual pattern after we added just one other piece of information.\nPlenty of corroborating information is already floating around dark corners of the web, given the frequent high-profile data breaches of the past decade. Consider what China already knows: In 2015, a federal database containing the personal information of more than four million people with security clearances was stolen by Chinese hackers presumed to be state actors.\n\u201cFrom those very detailed documents, they may gather a good deal of information about a person,\u201d said David S. Kris, a co-founder of the consulting firm Culper Partners and former assistant attorney general for the national security division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Kris said he was also included in the data that was hacked. \u201cThe more you can combine location-based data into a mosaic with other information, the more likely you are to gain real insight into an adversary.\u201d\nLocation data potentially gives any enemy an opening for attack. Russians, whose intelligence apparatus has worked for decades to disrupt American democracy, could simply leak location information to embarrass the government, the legal system or particular officials.\n\u201cThink about Russia\u2019s efforts to undermine public trust and confidence in our democratic institutions,\u201d Suzanne Spaulding, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, told us. \u201cThink about all of the ways they could use location data to do that. Think about tracking judges everywhere they went and how you could use that to undermine confidence in our courts and our justice system.\u201d\nAfter Ms. Spaulding raised the danger of tracking judges, we checked the data file for courthouse employees. In minutes, we found dozens of potential targets by watching smartphones sharing their precise locations inside Washington courthouses. One person whose movements we traced has a role in the technology division, which controls servers containing data for the Supreme Court.\nFor people with political power, knowing those locations could put their safety \u2014 and our national security \u2014 at risk. Experts told Times Opinion that foreign governments could use the data to monitor sensitive sites and identify people with access to them, and their associates.\n\u201cNot everybody in the department has a national security position, not everybody has access to classified or higher-level stuff,\u201d the senior Defense official said. \u201cBut everyone in the department is of some interest or value to a lot of adversaries just by virtue of being a member of the Defense Department, just by working at the Pentagon.\u201d\nat the Pentagon\nThe possibilities for blackmail are endless. Once stolen, details on sexual interests and extramarital affairs can provide opportunities for extortion. Targets could be coerced in ways large and small, compelled to make decisions or take actions for a foreign government. Or the locations themselves could provide valuable intelligence about security practices, contacts, schedules and the identities of people in prominent and sensitive posts, with access to state secrets or critical infrastructure.\nWith no training and far more limited technical tools than those of a state intelligence service, we were able to use the location data \u2014 date, time and length of stay \u2014 to make basic inferences. By determining whether two people were in the same place at the same time, it was easy to zero in on spouses, co-workers or friends. Cataloguing their movements revealed even more associations, creating the map of a robust social network that would be nearly impossible to determine through traditional surveillance. In cases where it was difficult to identify an individual, associations offered more clues about workplaces and interests.\nIn one case, it proved difficult to confirm the identity of a man listed in public records who had a common name. Examining his associations revealed that he met multiple times with someone carrying another phone that was being tracked. That person was, we soon learned, his brother. That piece of information doubled the pool of digital breadcrumbs to follow, ultimately helping confirm both of their identities.\nNow consider elections. Bad actors could monitor candidates and elected leaders for intelligence that could be leaked or used to blackmail them. There are also no regulations limiting how long location data can be stored. Data swept up today may prove valuable in the future, as everyday citizens rise to positions of authority and influence only to have their precise movements from years gone by reviewed for damaging insights.\nDefense contractors and employees at secure locations like power plants are all at risk.\nWe found smartphone pings at all of these sorts of sites. In one case, someone who spent their weekdays at the Pentagon visited a mental health and substance abuse facility multiple times.\nEven just commuting to work can be risky for people in prominent positions. \u201cThe easiest way to figure out how to get to you is know you always have the same routine,\u201d said Mr. Rasser, the former Central Intelligence Agency officer. He said he mixes up his own routine, partly because the C.I.A. emphasized such methods when he joined.\nThe threats will only grow as more data is collected and shared. More apps will enter the marketplace using tracking technology. And companies are becoming more sophisticated at collecting location data, adding signals from Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons. They also often rely on one-time consent or disclosures that don\u2019t explicitly state what\u2019s collected or shared.\nExperts emphasized how location data has joined many other kinds of sensitive information in the espionage toolkit, showing how intelligence agencies must continually adapt to the digital age.\n\u201cWe need to learn to operate with fewer secrets,\u201d Ms. Spaulding said.\nEven areas once thought to be secure showed up in the data. Personal phones aren\u2019t generally allowed inside the C.I.A. or the National Security Agency. But while no pings registered inside the C.I.A. headquarters, we found thousands of pings in the parking lots outside, with trails that led to the homes of likely employees.\nSimilarly, there were no blackout areas in many sensitive government buildings. We observed thousands of pings inside the Pentagon, on military bases, in F.B.I. headquarters and in Secret Service facilities across the country. (Intelligence facilities also have secure areas where certain electronic devices aren\u2019t permitted.)\nThe risks posed by location-tracking remain largely unaddressed by the government. Beginning last year, the Department of Defense prohibited geolocation features and functionality from being used by its workers on devices in \u201coperational areas\u201d like foreign military bases. For all other locations, the department said it would consider the risks and issue specific recommendations to personnel.\nFor now, the department does not issue guidance to employees about downloading specific apps, including those that might share location data with third parties. \u201cInstead, we focused on certain core characteristics of the geolocation functionality and identified what risks those characteristics posed,\u201d a department spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said in an email.\nAgencies with a need for heightened security are left in a vulnerable position. Phones are ubiquitous, and so long as granular location tracking remains legal, even the Defense Department must play along. \u201cWe cannot stop our workforce of 3.6 million people from living their everyday lives,\u201d a senior department official told us.\nWe haven\u2019t identified any serving elected representatives in our data, but we found a former House representative and dozens of prominent public officials, including chiefs of staff, security officials and subcommittee staff members.\nGiven their proximity to public figures with public schedules and their presence at training sites and field offices, Secret Service agents were particularly easy to identify. With little difficulty, we were able to track a Secret Service agent who spent most of his daytime hours in the West Wing of the White House. He also joined President Trump at the National Cathedral the day after the inauguration.\nJames J. Rowley Training Center\nWhile the data reviewed by Times Opinion is from three years ago, similar information is being collected daily and often resold to third parties, meaning anyone with current access to such data could feasibly, in near real time, track people within arm\u2019s reach of the president or other powerful figures.\n\u201cIf you want to take action against someone, you have to find them first,\u201d said Mr. Kris, the former Department of Justice official. \u201cI\u2019m wary of breathless, pearl-clutching, speculative, sensationalistic counterintelligence concerns. This doesn\u2019t strike me as falling into that category. I think there is a legitimate concern here.\u201d\nLeaked location data may open the door to other cyber vulnerabilities. Foreign actors could learn movement details and infer meeting locations, which could be used to conduct a type of scam where targets receive fake emails \u2014 posing as a friend you just met with or a business you just visited \u2014 including a phony link meant to steal your password or install malware.\n\u201cLocation tracking data of individuals can be used to facilitate reconnaissance, recruitment, social engineering, extortion and in worst-case scenarios, things like kidnapping and assassination,\u201d warned Kelli Vanderlee, manager of intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity company FireEye.\nThose are not theoretical threats. The phone of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in 2018, was allegedly compromised, possibly allowing his location data to be used to follow him.\nLast year, Strava, a company that makes a fitness app, released a global map showing 700 million activities that clearly revealed American military bases abroad. The Department of Defense issued its recent guidance after discovering the problem. The data reviewed by Times Opinion revealed several points on domestic military bases as well, showing how some of the nation\u2019s most secure armed sites can be exposed.\n\u201cAn adversary can still glean a lot from your whereabouts on the base itself,\u201d said Mr. Rasser, the former C.I.A. officer. \u201cIf you\u2019re always at a certain part of the base, at a certain time, you can start piecing together what the function of that corner of the base could be based on the person\u2019s job duties.\u201d\nUsing base locations as a guide, Times Opinion accurately surmised the job title of a commander in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. He regularly traveled to the Pentagon and visited Joint Base Andrews, perhaps best known as the home of the president\u2019s airliner, Air Force One.\nAndrews\nIt\u2019s not necessary for someone to visit sensitive locations to be open to scrutiny or criticism. Location data could become a powerful political tool, exposing the private lives of wealthy elites who prefer to adopt a more egalitarian persona. It is not difficult to imagine efforts to undermine a political campaign by exposing travels through private airports or visits to expensive restaurants and luxurious spas.\nThe sources who provided the trove of location information to Times Opinion did so to press for regulation and increased scrutiny of the location data market. Some solutions exist that could help improve privacy while ensuring businesses can still perform some of the analysis they do today, like limiting the ability to identify individual paths, changing how long the information is stored and limiting how it\u2019s sold.\nSo far, Washington has done virtually nothing to address the threats, and location data companies have every reason to keep refining their tracking, sucking up more data and selling it to the highest bidders.\nStuart A.

We Made It Visible.\nImmense amounts of methane are escaping from oil and gas sites nationwide, worsening global warming, even as the Trump administration weakens restrictions on offenders.\nImmense amounts of methane are escaping from oil and gas sites nationwide, worsening global warming, even as the Trump administration weakens restrictions on offenders.\nTo the naked eye, there is nothing out of the ordinary at the DCP Pegasus gas processing plant in West Texas, one of the thousands of installations in the vast Permian Basin that have transformed America into the largest oil and gas producer in the world.\nBut a highly specialized camera sees what the human eye cannot: a major release of methane, the main component of natural gas and a potent greenhouse gas that is helping to warm the planet at an alarming rate.\nTwo New York Times journalists detected this from a tiny plane, crammed with scientific equipment, circling above the oil and gas sites that dot the Permian, an oil field bigger than Kansas. In just a few hours, the plane\u2019s instruments identified six sites with unusually high methane emissions.\nMethane is loosely regulated, difficult to detect and rising sharply. The Times\u2019s aerial and on-the-ground research, along with an examination of lobbying activities by the companies that own the sites, shows how the energy industry is seeking and winning looser federal regulations on methane, a major contributor to global warming.\nOperators of the sites identified by The Times are among the very companies that have lobbied the Trump administration, either directly or through trade organizations, to weaken regulations on methane, a review of regulatory filings, meeting minutes and attendance logs shows. These local companies, along with oil-industry lobby groups that represent the world\u2019s largest energy companies, are fighting rules that would force them to more aggressively fix emissions like these.\nNext year, the administration could move forward with a plan that would effectively eliminate requirements that oil companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from oil and gas facilities. By the E.P.A.\u2019s own calculations, the rollback would increase methane emissions by 370,000 tons through 2025, enough to power more than a million homes for a year.\nIn the air, Times reporters surveyed an area in and around two counties in the heart of the Permian with the help of specialists in methane detection.\n\u201cThis site\u2019s definitely leaking,\u201d said Paolo Wilczak, a scientist and the pilot of the two-seater aircraft, as a laptop monitor hooked up to the equipment registered a blip in methane levels. \u201cAnd that one, too.\u201d\nThe reporters drove to the sites armed with infrared video gear that revealed methane billowing from tanks, seeping from pipes and wafting from bright flares that are designed to burn off the gas, but sometimes fail to do so completely. At one site, a worker walked directly into a methane plume unprotected.\nTim Doty, a former senior official at the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality who is trained in infrared leak detection, examined and helped analyze the findings. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy amount of emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a little bit of investigative work, but with an infrared camera, you can see it.\u201d\nOil and gas companies were committed to driving down emissions \u201cwhile delivering affordable, reliable energy to American families,\u201d said Howard Feldman, senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs at the American Petroleum Institute, a major industry lobby group. Its members believed that regulations should be improved, however, to provide clarity for businesses, avoid duplicating state rules and drive industry innovation, he said.\nThe regulatory rollback sought by the energy industry is the latest chapter in the administration\u2019s historic effort to weaken environmental and climate regulations while waging a broad-based attack on climate science.\nScientists say that, in weakening the rules, the Trump administration underestimates methane\u2019s global climate effects. It also disregards research that suggests methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure are far larger than previously estimated.\nThe findings address the mystery behind rising levels of methane in the atmosphere. Methane levels have soared since 2007 for reasons that still aren\u2019t fully understood. But fracking natural-gas production, which accelerated just as atmospheric methane levels jumped, is a prime suspect.\nMethane leaks from oil and gas production threaten to erode the advantage that natural gas has over coal in meeting the world\u2019s energy needs, scientists say. When burned for electricity, natural gas produces about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. But if methane is not burned off when released, it can warm the planet more than 80 times as much as carbon dioxide over a 20-year period.\nMethane also contributes to ground-level ozone, which, if inhaled, can cause asthma and other health problems.\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly clear that fossil fuel production has dramatically increased global methane emissions,\u201d said Robert Howarth, an earth system scientist at Cornell University and author of a study estimating that North American shale gas production may be responsible for about a third of the global increase in methane emissions over the past decade.\nA bright red-and-white plane pirouetted above the Texas scrub, banking so sharply it were as if the tiny aircraft was spinning on a wingtip. Mr. Wilczak, a pilot and flight scientist for Scientific Aviation, an aerial leak-detection company, executed tight circles above an oil installation.\nTiny tubes affixed to the wings siphoned air to a sensitive spectrometer, jammed behind the seats, capable of detecting and measuring methane. Mr. Wilczak said it takes about seven seconds for the air to pass through and register a reading on a computer balanced on the lap of the only passenger.\nDetecting methane emissions is difficult work that often begins with flights like these. Oil and gas sites are not required to install round-the-clock emissions monitors, and flights are one of the ways to spot trouble.\nIn the course of about four hours of flying, we found at least six sites with high methane-emissions readings, ranging from about 300 pounds to almost 1,100 pounds an hour, including at DCP Pegasus, which is part owned by the energy giant Phillips 66.\nThose readings would very likely put those sites in the category of \u201csuper emitters,\u201d a term used by scientists to describe large-scale releases that are responsible for a disproportionately high share of methane emissions from oil and gas sites. In a 2017 study of the Barnett shale basin in Texas, methane releases of about 60 pounds or more an hour were classified as super emitters, making up just 1 percent of sites but accounting for nearly half of total emissions.\nIn an aerial survey, Times reporters found six methane \u201csuper emitters.\u201d The gray line indicates their flight path.\nNORTH\nODESSA\n2 MILES\nPermian\nBasin\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n1,077\n452\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Driver Plant\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\nODESSA\n2 MILES\nPermian\nBasin\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n452\n1,077\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nTarga Driver Plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\nPermian\nBasin\n5 MILES\nODESSA\nDetail\nTEXAS\nSurvey\nflight path\n678\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nNewberry gas plant\n298\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\n452\n1,077\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nTarga Driver Plant\n664\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nThe region is dotted with\noil and gas infrastructure\n315\nPOUNDS METHANE PER HOUR\nTank site\nNORTH\n5 MILES\nDetail\nTEXAS\nPermian\nBasin\n678\nLBS METHANE/HR\nNewberry gas plant\n664\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nSurvey\nflight path\n1,077\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Driver Plant\n315\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n298\nThe region is\ndotted with\noil and gas\ninfrastructure\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n452\nLBS METHANE/HR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nNORTH\n5 MILES\nDetail\nTEXAS\nPermian\nBasin\n678\nLBS METHANE/HR\nNewberry gas plant\n664\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Midkiff Plant\nSurvey\nflight path\n1,077\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTarga Driver Plant\n315\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n298\nThe region is\ndotted with\noil and gas\ninfrastructure\nLBS METHANE/HR\nTank site\n452\nLBS METHANE/HR\nDCP Pegasus gas\nprocessing plant\nBy Denise Lu | Sources: Scientific Aviation and Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite.\nOn the ground, the Permian is a landscape of parched cotton fields, bobbing pump jacks and dirt roads that stretch for miles. We drove out to photograph the emissions we had detected from the air with a specialized infrared camera fitted with a lens made not of glass, but metal.\nAt the DCP Pegasus plant, south of Midland, the camera transformed a tranquil scene into a furnace. Hot columns of gas shot into the air. Fumes engulfed structures.\nThe camera sees several types of gases, including methane and ethane, both greenhouse gases, as well as pollutants called volatile organic compounds. Any emissions are likely to contain a mixture of the gases. Mr. Doty, who now runs a consultancy, said the emissions appeared to be from vapor combustors, compressors and storage tanks.\nAccording to Texas regulatory records, DCP has reported more than 250 unpermitted emissions events this year in the Permian Basin and is among the area\u2019s bigger emitters. State rules allow facilities to report irregular emissions without penalties.\nSarah Sandberg, a spokeswoman for DCP, which operates several pipelines and almost 50 gas processing plants nationwide, said she had \u201cmany questions regarding the accuracy of your assessment and assumptions.\u201d She did not respond to repeated follow-ups.\nPhillips 66 declined to comment.\nAt the EagleClaw Midstream gas processing plant just south of Pecos, we found emissions spewing from the top of a wastewater tank. The plant\u2019s manager, Justin Bishop, walked over to look at what we were filming. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know it was leaking,\u201d he said.\nA worker went to check on the tank, climbing some stairs and walking into the plume.\nHe said the emissions were simply water vapor. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t reporting it.\u201d\nBut Mr. Doty, the former Texas emissions regulator, said water vapor would have been visible to the naked eye. \u201cThat isn\u2019t water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of emissions.\u201d\nIn a statement, EagleClaw said its workers had discovered that the tank\u2019s valve did require maintenance and that the problem had been fixed 30 minutes later.\n\u201cThe amount of gas that leaked was determined, by our experts, to be well below any legal reportable limits,\u201d Todd Carpenter, the company\u2019s chief compliance officer, said in an email. He added that the safety and security of EagleClaw\u2019s employees, and of the public, \u201cwas of primary concern.\u201d The company has not filed an emissions event report this year.\nAs early as March 2017 \u2014 just months after the presidential inauguration \u2014 fossil fuel companies made contact with the Trump administration to argue for a rollback of methane emissions rules.\nThey held repeated meetings with federal officials, including an important one in November 2018, when lobbyists for DCP, EagleClaw and other oil processing companies met with officials from the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss a critical topic: unintended or \u201cfugitive\u201d methane emissions.\nRepresentatives of the lobby group, GPA Midstream, argued that the E.P.A. should relax monitoring requirements for fugitive emissions at gathering and compressor facilities, according to regulatory records reviewed by The Times. GPA Midstream met with Trump administration officials at least three times on the matter.\n\u201cMore frequent monitoring would not be cost-effective,\u201d GPA lobbyists later said in comments filed with the agency, and stricter regulation was \u201ccostly and burdensome.\u201d\nThe efforts were part of a broader industry push to reverse Obama-era rules that would have forced operators to more aggressively monitor and repair natural gas leaks while reducing flaring.\nEarlier, at a March 2018 meeting, lobbyists for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents thousands of oil and gas companies nationwide, circulated material that forcefully rebutted the scientific evidence of large fugitive emissions from drilling sites. The lobbyists said the data \u201ccreate the illusion\u201d that super emitters pose a problem, according to a handout from the meeting.\nThe petroleum association vice president, Lee O. Fuller, said in an interview that for smaller operators, which often run low-producing wells, the costs of excessive regulations could be crippling. They \u201ccould put many out of business,\u201d he said.\nThe companies found an administration willing to listen. Before his appointment to the post of assistant administrator at the E.P.A. overseeing air pollution, William L. Wehrum lobbied on behalf of oil and gas producers, including gas processors and petroleum refineries.\nMr. Wehrum resigned from the agency in June and is under investigation for his contacts with former clients. His former boss, Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, also lobbied for energy companies earlier in his career.\nBy this August, the E.P.A. had proposed a broad rollback, including rescinding direct regulations of methane emissions completely. Volatile organic compounds, a separate but related category of gases, would remain regulated, which would have a side effect of limiting some methane emissions.\nIn a statement, an E.P.A. spokesman, Michael Abboud, said methane was a valuable resource, so the industry already \u201chas an incentive to minimize leaks.\u201d He added that E.P.A. staff members work with ethics officials \u201cto ensure they are in compliance with all ethics rules.\u201d Mr. Wehrum did not respond to a request for comment.\nEnergy giants including BP, Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell have, to varying degrees, publicly supported methane regulation. However, trade associations representing all three, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Independent Petroleum Association of America, have fought against direct regulation.\nA spokesman for BP said the company wanted to maintain the direct regulation of methane, and an official from Exxon said the company was making voluntary efforts to reduce methane, including infrastructure upgrades. A Chevron spokesman, Sean Comey, said the company \u201csupports global efforts to reduce flaring and methane emissions.\u201d Shell said it supported the continued direct regulation of methane and more frequent leak inspections.\nSome companies are starting to use infrared cameras, drones and other technology to detect methane leaks. BP said recently it would use drones and surveillance cameras to monitor for fugitive emissions at new oil and gas projects. Shell is testing solar-powered technology to watch for leaks.\nAs the boom-and-bust oil business goes through another one of its financial gyrations \u2014 production in the Permian is expected to slow as a glut of gas and rock-bottom prices take their toll \u2014 there are concerns that investments in methane detection won\u2019t be a priority, particularly for smaller operators.\nOne site where we identified leakage with the infrared camera was an unmanned well pad with a battery of gray tanks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of volume coming out of there,\u201d Mr. Doty later said of the images. \u201cIf this is going 100 percent of the time, that\u2019s a lot of emissions.\u201d\nThe site was owned by MDC Texas Operator, which we discovered had filed for bankruptcy that very day.\nCalls to the company went unanswered, and its bankruptcy lawyers didn\u2019t return requests for comment. It is unknown whether the tank is still spewing gas.\nFor more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.\nProduced by Matt Ruby\nAbout the infrared video\nTo create images of methane emissions in the Permian Basin, The Times used a custom-built FLIR camera that converts infrared energy into an electronic signal to create moving pictures. The camera\u2019s filter allows infrared wavelengths between 3.2 to 3.4 micrometers on the electromagnetic spectrum to pass through to the sensor.\nTo visualize gas, the camera uses helium to cool down the sensor to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, around minus 200 degrees Celsius. Unlike traditional photography lenses, which are glass, the infrared images were created using metal lenses made from germanium, which is transparent at infrared wavelengths.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Presidential War Powers\nIn recent years, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel has claimed that the Constitution authorizes the president, as commander in chief, to order the military to attack other countries without congressional permission if the president determines that this would be anticipatory self-defense or otherwise serve the interests of the United States \u2014 at least where the nature, scope and duration of the anticipated hostilities are \u201climited,\u201d like airstrikes against Libyan government forces in 2011 and Syrian government forces in 2017 and 2018.\nDo you agree with the O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning? Under what circumstances other than a literally imminent threat to the United States, if any, does the Constitution permit a president to order an attack on another country without prior Congressional authorization? What about bombing Iranian or North Korean nuclear facilities?\nweld's Answer\nIt is imperative that the government of the United States be able to respond swiftly and decisively to hostile threats to our safety, security, and other essential interests. This does not require evisceration of our Constitution\u2019s unambiguous assignment of war making powers to Congress.\n\u2022 Do you agree with the O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning?\nIt is imperative that the government of the United States be able to respond swiftly and decisively to hostile threats to our safety, security, and other essential interests. This does not require evisceration of our Constitution\u2019s unambiguous assignment of war making powers to Congress. This power has been inappropriately compromised and eroded over a number of successive Presidential administrations and various Congresses in the hands of each of the major parties. The O.L.C.\u2019s reasoning is simply a recent manifestation. The Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s contra-Constitutional reasoning and its conclusions are incorrect.\nReturning the war making power to Congress will require careful attention to policies and procedures for effective and efficient communication between our diplomatic, military, homeland security, and intelligence officials to appropriately designated members, supported by adequately trained and resourced staff, all with the requisite security clearances. It will be incumbent upon leaders in Congress to develop appropriate rules for making decisions in ways appropriate to the variety of situations that can and do arise.\n\u2022 Under what circumstances other than a literally imminent threat to the United States, if any, does the Constitution permit a president to order an attack on another country without prior Congressional authorization?\nThe President possesses Constitutional authority to protect against specific, imminent, and concrete threats to the United States or risks of death or serious physical injury to United States persons. Even so, it is prudent for the President to seek carefully-circumscribed Congressional authorization related to then-prevailing conditions and circumstances in anticipation of these types of threats.\nThis type of authorization should be subject to periodic Congressional review and require periodic Congressional renewal. It is outrageous that the Trump Administration (like others before it) continues to rely on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force; there will soon be American soldiers and sailors deployed abroad and in harm\u2019s way based on a law passed before they were born.\n\u2022 What about bombing Iranian or North Korean nuclear facilities?\nThe Iranian and North Korean situations are the sort for which the President should seek carefully-circumscribed Congressional authorization to use force as expressly deemed necessary. With appropriate authorization, the President can thereafter properly operate with prudent judgment about whether, how, when to exercise military force as authorized.\nRead full answer\n2. Military Force Against Americans\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, an American citizen who had been arrested in Chicago and accused of terrorism links was deemed to be an \u201cenemy combatant\u201d and transferred to military custody. He was held in wartime detention without trial for years, then transferred back to the civilian justice system before the Supreme Court could resolve his case. In 2011, an American drone strike targeted and killed an American citizen who had been deemed to be an operational terrorist leader whose capture was infeasible, but who had not been charged or convicted in a trial. In 2019, the executive branch was reported to be considering invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces on domestic soil to enforce immigration laws.\nAre any of these examples unlawful? Under what circumstances, if any, may a president use military force within the United States or against Americans?\nweld's Answer\nIt is not generally appropriate to use our national military resources for domestic policing, law enforcement, or other purposes or against United States citizens, certainly when based on contorted legal reasoning used to avoid Congressional authorization. As Professor Louis Hartz observed, the essence of democracy is that the individual should never be backed into the corner.\nIt is not generally appropriate to use our national military resources for domestic policing, law enforcement, or other purposes or against United States citizens, certainly when based on contorted legal reasoning used to avoid Congressional authorization. As Professor Louis Hartz observed, the essence of democracy is that the individual should never be backed into the corner. The use of military force on our soil or against our citizens is an extreme counter-example, so any Congressional authorization for this sort of extra-ordinary activity must be thoroughly informed and highly specific.\nRead full answer\n3. Commander in Chief Power\nAfter 9/11, the NSA wiretapped on domestic soil without court orders seemingly required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the CIA used coercive interrogation techniques on prisoners despite antitorture laws and treaties. In the 2014 Bergdahl deal, the military transferred five Guantanamo detainees to Qatar without giving Congress the 30 days notice seemingly required by a detainee transfer law. In each instance, executive branch lawyers said the apparent legal barriers were unconstitutional encroachments on commander in chief power.\nWere any of these actions unlawful? Under what circumstances, if any, do you believe the Constitution empowers the president, as commander in chief, to override or bypass prohibitions or requirements in federal statutes?\nweld's Answer\nOne of the President\u2019s core constitutional responsibilities is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. In each of these three instances, the executive actions were contrary to duly enacted laws within the scope of Congressional authority.\nOne of the President\u2019s core constitutional responsibilities is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed.

Presidential Signing Statements\nIn recent decades, presidents have started to routinely use \u201csigning statements\u201d to claim a constitutional right to bypass provisions of bills they are signing into law. The American Bar Association has called the practice unconstitutional and said presidents can choose only between vetoing bills, giving Congress an opportunity to override their judgments, or signing and obeying all of them. Other legal specialists have disagreed, saying the practice is appropriate so long as the theories of executive power used to challenge provisions are legitimate.\nUnder what circumstances, if any, would you use signing statements to deem provisions of bills constitutionally invalid?\nweld's Answer\nThe separation of powers assigns to Congress authority to make the laws and to the Courts to declare whether they are constitutionally valid. A President presented with a facially constitutionally problematic bill may properly exercise veto authority; the President is otherwise (i.e, after signing a bill into law or after Congressional override of a veto) bound to take care the law is faithfully executed.\nThe separation of powers assigns to Congress authority to make the laws and to the Courts to declare whether they are constitutionally valid.

That said, under the limited circumstance in which omnibus or other consolidated legislation may contain certain constitutionally infirm provisions, a signing statement is appropriate to indicate Presidential discomfort with engaging in statutorily authorized but constitutionally suspect actions.\nRead full answer\n5. Presidential Obstruction of Justice\nBefore becoming attorney general, William P. Barr took the position that obstruction of justice laws should not be interpreted as applying to a president who abuses his official powers to impede an investigation for corrupt reasons \u2014 and that, as a constitutional matter, Congress could not criminalize abuse of official power even if lawmakers explicitly intended to do so.\nAs a constitutional matter, does Congress have the authority to criminalize a president\u2019s abuse of Article II powers for corrupt purposes? As a statutory matter, do current obstruction-of-justice laws apply to a president\u2019s abuse of his official powers?\nweld's Answer\nYes of course Congress possesses that power. Mr. Barr\u2019s analysis, both in his June 2019 memorandum and subsequently, proves far too much and is legally and constitutionally unsound.\nYes of course Congress possesses that power.

Presidential Indictability\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u2014 first under the Nixon administration during the Watergate scandal, and then under then Clinton administration during the Whitewater/Lewinsky scandal \u2014 has asserted that sitting presidents are immune from criminal indictment and trial and so any such criminal process has to come after they leave office, a view that bound the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\nIs this the correct interpretation of the Constitution? If not, would you instruct your attorney general to rescind those O.L.C. opinions? If so, would you sign legislation tolling the statute of limitations for any criminal offenses by presidents so that it does not run while they are in office?\nweld's Answer\nIn my view it would be constitutional for the Justice Department to file a sealed indictment against a sitting president, so as to satisfy the statute of limitations, as long as the sitting president was not obliged to respond to the charges or to compulsory process while in office.\nIn my view it would be constitutional for the Justice Department to file a sealed indictment against a sitting president, so as to satisfy the statute of limitations, as long as the sitting president was not obliged to respond to the charges or to compulsory process while in office.\nRead full answer\n7. Executive Secrecy\nPresidents of both parties have claimed that executive privilege applies not only to their own internal White House communications, but also to internal deliberations within government department and agencies that do not involve the president. The Trump legal team has further argued that congressional subpoenas whose primary goal is to uncover potential wrongdoing, rather than to inform bill writing, are invalid because they lack a legitimate legislative purpose.\nDoes executive privilege extend to agency deliberations that did not involve the White House? Does Congress have legitimate constitutional authority to issue subpoenas compelling disclosure of information about potential wrongdoing?\nweld's Answer\nI think an otherwise proper assertion of executive privilege could extend to executive branch deliberations not involving the White House. On the other hand, the oversight responsibilities of Congress clearly warrant the issuance of subpoenas seeking evidence of potential wrongdoing.\nI think an otherwise proper assertion of executive privilege could extend to executive branch deliberations not involving the White House.

Press Freedoms\nProsecutors recently expanded a criminal case against Julian Assange to include accusations that he violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and publishing classified documents leaked in 2010 by Chelsea Manning, which could establish a precedent that such common journalistic activities (a separate question from whether Assange counts as a \u201cjournalist\u201d) can be treated as a crime in America.\nAre these charges constitutional?

Potential Post-Trump Reforms\nMany recent disputes have raised the prospect that Congress, in a post-Trump era, will seek to tighten legal limits on executive power to enforce previous norms of presidential behavior.\nWhat sorts of new legal restrictions on presidential authority, if any, would you view as constitutional and be inclined to sign into law on these topics?\n\u2022 Ability of a president to declare a national emergency and activate various standby powers, and to invoke national-security exceptions to various legal prohibitions\n\u2022 The ability of a president to order the removal of a special prosecutor appointed to scrutinize potential high-level executive branch wrongdoing\n\u2022 The ability of a president or presidential candidate to choose not to make public his or her tax returns\n\u2022 The ability of a president or presidential candidate to accept non-financial assistance from a foreign government in an election\n\u2022 The ability of a president to choose not to divest from significant business holdings or place them into a blind trust, and to engage in business transactions with foreign governments while in office\n\u2022 The ability of a president to hire close family members for White House positions\n\u2022 The ability of a president to intervene in Justice Department law enforcement actions, including in matters like antitrust and directing the opening or closing of investigations into political allies or opponents\n\u2022 The ability of a president to override recommended denials of security clearances\n\u2022 The ability of a president to use the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to install someone as acting agency or department head who was not in the normal order of succession for that position\n\u2022 The application of the Freedom of Information Act requests to White House records, which are currently exempt\n\u2022 The ability of a president to pardon or dangle a potential pardon at someone in a self-protective context \u2014 such as an investigation in which the president, one of his family members, or a campaign or close business associate is a target, subject, or witness \u2014 without disclosing to Congress communications and materials about the pardon, including evidence against the recipient\nweld's Answer\nI do not believe that legislation aimed at curbing the President\u2019s emergency or standby powers in a post-Trump world would be necessary, and might be of doubtful constitutionality.

Tell me whatever you need and I will provide it for you.\nThe Iran Cables: Secret Documents Show How Tehran Wields Power in Iraq\nHundreds of leaked intelligence reports shed light on a shadow war for regional influence \u2014 and the battles within the Islamic Republic\u2019s own spy divisions\nIn mid-October, with unrest swirling in Baghdad, a familiar visitor slipped quietly into the Iraqi capital. The city had been under siege for weeks, as protesters marched in the streets, demanding an end to corruption and calling for the ouster of the prime minister, Adil Abdul Mahdi. In particular, they denounced the outsize influence of their neighbor Iran in Iraqi politics, burning Iranian flags and attacking an Iranian consulate.\nThe visitor was there to restore order, but his presence highlighted the protesters\u2019 biggest grievance: he was Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, head of Iran\u2019s powerful Quds Force, and he had come to persuade an ally in the Iraqi Parliament to help the prime minister hold onto his job.\nIt was not the first time General Suleimani had been dispatched to Baghdad to do damage control. Tehran\u2019s efforts to prop up Mr. Mahdi are part of its long campaign to maintain Iraq as a pliable client state.\nNow leaked Iranian documents offer a detailed portrait of just how aggressively Tehran has worked to embed itself into Iraqi affairs, and of the unique role of General Suleimani. The documents are contained in an archive of secret Iranian intelligence cables obtained by The Intercept and shared with The New York Times for this article, which is being published simultaneously by both news organizations.\nThe unprecedented leak exposes Tehran\u2019s vast influence in Iraq, detailing years of painstaking work by Iranian spies to co-opt the country\u2019s leaders, pay Iraqi agents working for the Americans to switch sides and infiltrate every aspect of Iraq\u2019s political, economic and religious life.\nMany of the cables describe real-life espionage capers that feel torn from the pages of a spy thriller. Meetings are arranged in dark alleyways and shopping malls or under the cover of a hunting excursion or a birthday party. Informants lurk at the Baghdad airport, snapping pictures of American soldiers and keeping tabs on coalition military flights. Agents drive meandering routes to meetings to evade surveillance. Sources are plied with gifts of pistachios, cologne and saffron. Iraqi officials, if necessary, are offered bribes. The archive even contains expense reports from intelligence ministry officers in Iraq, including one totaling 87.5 euros spent on gifts for a Kurdish commander.\nAbout the Iran Cables\nThis article was reported in partnership with The Intercept, a nonprofit investigative news organization.\n[Read the key findings from this investigation.]\nAccording to one of the leaked Iranian intelligence cables, Mr. Mahdi, who in exile worked closely with Iran while Saddam Hussein was in power in Iraq, had a \u201cspecial relationship with the I.R.I.\u201d \u2014 the Islamic Republic of Iran \u2014 when he was Iraq\u2019s oil minister in 2014. The exact nature of that relationship is not detailed in the cable, and, as one former senior U.S. official cautioned, a \u201cspecial relationship could mean a lot of things \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean he is an agent of the Iranian government.\u201d But no Iraqi politician can become prime minister without Iran\u2019s blessing, and Mr. Mahdi, when he secured the premiership in 2018, was seen as a compromise candidate acceptable to both Iran and the United States.\nThe leaked cables offer an extraordinary glimpse inside the secretive Iranian regime. They also detail the extent to which Iraq has fallen under Iranian influence since the American invasion in 2003, which transformed Iraq into a gateway for Iranian power, connecting the Islamic Republic\u2019s geography of dominance from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe trove of leaked Iranian intelligence reports largely confirms what was already known about Iran\u2019s firm grip on Iraqi politics. But the reports reveal far more than was previously understood about the extent to which Iran and the United States have used Iraq as a staging area for their spy games. They also shed new light on the complex internal politics of the Iranian government, where competing factions are grappling with many of the same challenges faced by American occupying forces as they struggled to stabilize Iraq after the United States invasion.\nAnd the documents show how Iran, at nearly every turn, has outmaneuvered the United States in the contest for influence.\nThe archive is made up of hundreds of reports and cables written mainly in 2014 and 2015 by officers of Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence and Security, or M.O.I.S., who were serving in the field in Iraq. The intelligence ministry, Iran\u2019s version of the C.I.A., has a reputation as an analytical and professional agency, but it is overshadowed and often overruled by its more ideological counterpart, the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was formally established as an independent entity in 2009 at the order of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nIn Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, which Iran considers crucial to its national security, the Revolutionary Guards \u2014 and in particular its elite Quds Force, led by General Suleimani \u2014 determines Iran\u2019s policies. Ambassadors to those countries are appointed from the senior ranks of the Revolutionary Guards, not the foreign ministry, which oversees the intelligence ministry, according to several advisers to current and past Iranian administrations. Officers from the intelligence ministry and from the Revolutionary Guards in Iraq worked parallel to one another, said these sources. They reported their findings back to their respective headquarters in Tehran, which in turn organized them into reports for the Supreme Council of National Security.\nCultivating Iraqi officials was a key part of their job, and it was made easier by the alliances many Iraqi leaders forged with Iran when they belonged to opposition groups fighting Saddam Hussein. Many of Iraq\u2019s foremost political, military, and security officials have had secret relationships with Tehran, according to the documents. The same 2014 cable that described Mr. Mahdi\u2019s \u201cspecial relationship\u201d also named several other key members of the cabinet of former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi as having close ties with Iran.\n\u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0639\u0644 \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u06cc \u0627\u0634\u0631\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0637 \u0648 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0645\u062a\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0648 \u0628\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0628\u0627 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u062f\u0627\u0639\u0634 \u0648 \u0647\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0634\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639\u060c \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0647\u062f\u0641 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0632\u0627\u0631\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0622\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u0648 \u06cc\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f \u0647\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u060c \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u0648 \u0627\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642\u060c \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f.\nThe current objective is for this person to provide intelligence insights into the U.S. government\u2019s plans in Iraq, whether it is for dealing with ISIS or any other covert operations. The ultimate goal is for this person to be an informant, either in the U.S. State Department or with any Iraqi Sunni or Kurdish leaders who are willing to cooperate.\nA political analyst and adviser on Iraq to Iran\u2019s government, Gheis Ghoreishi, confirmed that Iran has focused on cultivating high-level officials in Iraq. \u201cWe have a good number of allies among Iraqi leaders who we can trust with our eyes closed,\u201d he said.\nThree Iranian officials were asked to comment for this article, in queries that described the existence of the leaked cables and reports. Alireza Miryusefi, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s United Nations mission, said he was away until later this month. Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran\u2019s United Nations ambassador, did not respond to a written request that was hand-delivered to his official residence. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif did not respond to an emailed request.\nWhen reached by telephone, Hassan Danaiefar, Iran\u2019s ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2017 and a former deputy commander of the Revolutionary Guards\u2019 naval forces, declined to directly address the existence of the cables or their release, but he did suggest that Iran had the upper hand in information gathering in Iraq. \u201cYes, we have a lot of information from Iraq on multiple issues, especially about what America was doing there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a wide gap between the reality and perception of U.S. actions in Iraq. I have many stories to tell.\u201d He declined to elaborate.\nAccording to the reports, after the American troop withdrawal in 2011, Iran moved quickly to add former C.I.A. informants to its payroll. One undated section of an intelligence ministry cable shows that Iran began the process of recruiting a spy inside the State Department. It is unclear what came of the recruitment effort, but according to the files, Iran had started meeting with the source, and offered to reward the potential asset with a salary, gold coins and other gifts. The State Department official is not named in the cable, but the person is described as someone who would be able to provide \u201cintelligence insights into the U.S. government\u2019s plans in Iraq, whether it is for dealing with ISIS or any other covert operations.\u201d\n\u201cThe subject\u2019s incentive in collaborating will be financial,\u201d the report said.\nThe State Department declined to comment on the matter.\nIn interviews, Iranian officials acknowledged that Iran viewed surveillance of American activity in Iraq after the United States invasion as critical to its survival and national security. When American forces toppled Saddam Hussein, Iran swiftly moved some of its best officers from both the intelligence ministry and from the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards to Iraq, according to the Iranian government advisers and a person affiliated with the Guards. President George W. Bush had declared Iran to be part of an \u201caxis of evil,\u201d and Iranian leaders believed Tehran would be next on Washington\u2019s list of regime-change capitals after Kabul and Baghdad.\n700 pages of documents\nAround the world, governments have had to contend with the occasional leak of secret communiqu\u00e9s or personal emails as a fact of modern life. Not so in Iran, where information is tightly controlled and the security services are widely feared.\nThe roughly 700 pages of leaked reports were sent anonymously to The Intercept, which translated them from Persian to English and shared them with The Times. The Intercept and The Times verified the authenticity of the documents but do not know who leaked them. The Intercept communicated over encrypted channels with the source, who declined to meet with a reporter. In these anonymous messages, the source said that they wanted to \u201clet the world know what Iran is doing in my country Iraq.\u201d\nLike the internal communications of any spy service, some of the reports contain raw intelligence whose accuracy is questionable, while others appear to represent the views of intelligence officers and sources with their own agendas.\nSome of the cables show bumbling and comical ineptitude, like one that describes the Iranian spies who broke into a German cultural institute in Iraq only to find they had the wrong codes and could not unlock the safes. Other officers were browbeaten by their superiors in Tehran for laziness, and for sending back to headquarters reports that relied only on news accounts.\nBut by and large, the intelligence ministry operatives portrayed in the documents appear patient, professional and pragmatic. Their main tasks are to keep Iraq from falling apart; from breeding Sunni militants on the Iranian border; from descending into sectarian warfare that might make Shia Muslims the targets of violence; and from spinning off an independent Kurdistan that would threaten regional stability and Iranian territorial integrity. The Revolutionary Guards and General Suleimani have also worked to eradicate the Islamic State, but with a greater focus on maintaining Iraq as a client state of Iran and making sure that political factions loyal to Tehran remain in power.\nThis portrait is all the more striking at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran. Since 2018, when President Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions, the White House has rushed ships to the Persian Gulf and reviewed military plans for war with Iran. In October, the Trump administration promised to send American troops to Saudi Arabia following attacks on oil facilities there for which Iran was widely blamed.\n\u2018Tell them we are at your service.\u2019\nWith a shared faith and tribal affiliations that span a porous border, Iran has long been a major presence in Southern Iraq. It has opened religious offices in Iraq\u2019s holy cities and posted banners of Iran\u2019s revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, on its streets. It supports some of the most powerful political parties in the south, dispatches Iranian students to study in Iraqi seminaries and sends Iranian construction workers to build Iraqi hotels and refurbish Iraqi shrines.\nBut while Iran may have bested the United States in the contest for influence in Baghdad, it has struggled to win popular support in the Iraqi south. Now, as the last six weeks of protests make clear, it is facing unexpectedly strong pushback. Across the south, Iranian-backed Iraqi political parties are seeing their headquarters burned and their leading operatives assassinated, an indication that Iran may have underestimated the Iraqi desire for independence not just from the United States but also from its neighbor.\nIn a sense, the leaked Iranian cables provide a final accounting of the 2003 United States invasion of Iraq. The notion that the Americans handed control of Iraq to Iran when they invaded now enjoys broad support, even within the United States military. A recent two-volume history of the Iraq War, published by the United States Army, details the campaign\u2019s many missteps and its \u201cstaggering cost\u201d in lives and money. Nearly 4,500 American troops were killed, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died and American taxpayers spent up to $2 trillion on the war. The study, which totals hundreds of pages and draws on declassified documents, concludes: \u201cAn emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor.\u201d\nTurkey\nTigris\nSyria\nIraq\nIran\nAkkaz\ngas field\nBaghdad\nFalluja\nJurf Al-Sakhar\nKarbala\nNajaf\nEuphrates\nSaudi Arabia\nKuwait\n100 miles\nBy The New York Times\nIran\u2019s rise as a power player in Iraq was in many ways a direct consequence of Washington\u2019s lack of any post-invasion plan. The early years following the fall of Saddam were chaotic, both in terms of security and in the lack of basic services like water and electricity. To most observers on the ground, it appeared as if the United States was shaping policy on the go, and in the dark.\nAmong the most disastrous American policies were the decisions to dismantle Iraq\u2019s armed forces and to purge from government service or the new armed forces any Iraqi who had been a member of Saddam\u2019s ruling Baath Party. This process, known as de-Baathification, automatically marginalized most Sunni men. Unemployed and resentful, they formed a violent insurgency targeting Americans and Shias seen as United States allies.\nAs sectarian warfare between Sunnis and Shias raged, the Shia population looked to Iran as a protector. When ISIS gained control of territory and cities, the Shias\u2019 vulnerability and the failure of the United States to protect them fueled efforts by the Revolutionary Guards and General Suleimani to recruit and mobilize Shia militias loyal to Iran.\nAccording to the intelligence ministry documents, Iran has continued to take advantage of the opportunities the United States has afforded it in Iraq. Iran, for example, reaped an intelligence windfall of American secrets as the United States presence began to recede after its 2011 troop withdrawal. The C.I.A. had tossed many of its longtime secret agents out on the street, leaving them jobless and destitute in a country still shattered from the invasion \u2014 and fearful that they could be killed for their links with the United States, possibly by Iran. Short of money, many began to offer their services to Tehran. And they were happy to tell the Iranians everything they knew about C.I.A. operations in Iraq.\nIn November 2014, one of them, an Iraqi who had spied for the C.I.A., broke and terrified that his ties to the Americans would cost him his life, switched sides. The C.I.A., according to the cable, had known the man by a nickname: \u201cDonnie Brasco.\u201d His Iranian handler would call him, simply \u201cSource 134992.\u201d\nTurning to Iran for protection, he said that everything he knew about American intelligence gathering in Iraq was for sale: the locations of C.I.A. safe houses; the names of hotels where C.I.A. operatives met with agents; details of his weapons and surveillance training; the names of other Iraqis working as spies for the Americans.\nSource 134992 told the Iranian operatives he had worked for the agency for 18 months starting in 2008, on a program targeting Al Qaeda. He said he had been paid well for his work \u2014 $3,000 per month, plus a one-time bonus of $20,000 and a car.\nBut swearing on the Quran, he promised that his days of spying for the United States were over, and agreed to write a full report for the Iranians on everything he knew from his time with the C.I.A.\n\u201cI will turn over to you all the documents and videos that I have from my training course,\u201d the Iraqi man told his Iranian handler, according to a 2014 Iranian intelligence report. \u201cAnd pictures and identifying features of my fellow trainees and my subordinates.\u201d\nThe C.I.A. declined to comment.\nIranian spies, Iraqi officials say, are everywhere in the south, and the region has long been a beehive of espionage. It was there, in Karbala in late 2014, that an Iraqi military intelligence officer, down from Baghdad, met with an Iranian intelligence official and offered to spy for Iran \u2014 and to tell the Iranians whatever he could about American activities in Iraq.\n\u201cIran is my second country and I love it,\u201d the Iraqi official told the Iranian officer, according to one of the cables. In a meeting that lasted more than three hours, the Iraqi told of his devotion to the Iranian system of government, in which clerics rule directly, and his admiration for Iranian movies.\nHe said he had come with a message from his boss in Baghdad, Lt. Gen. Hatem al-Maksusi, then commander of military intelligence in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense: \u201cTell them we are at your service. Whatever you need is at their disposal. We are Shiite and have a common enemy.\u201d\nGeneral al-Maksusi\u2019s messenger continued, \u201cAll of the Iraqi Army\u2019s intelligence \u2014 consider it yours.\u201d He told the Iranian intelligence officer about secret targeting software the United States had provided to the Iraqis, and offered to turn it over to the Iranians. \u201cIf you have a new laptop, give it to me so I can upload the program onto it,\u201d he said.\nAnd there was more, he said. The United States had also given Iraq a highly sensitive system for eavesdropping on mobile phones, which was run out of the prime minister\u2019s office and the headquarters of Iraqi military intelligence. \u201cI will put at your disposal whatever intelligence about it you want,\u201d he said.\nIn an interview, General al-Maksusi, disputed saying the things attributed to him in the cables and denied ever working for Iran. He praised Iran for its help in the fight against the Islamic State, but said he had also maintained a close relationship with the United States. \u201cI worked for Iraq and did not work for any other state,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not the intelligence director for the Shiites, but I was intelligence director for all of Iraq.\u201d\nWhen asked about the cable, a former American official said the United States had become aware of the Iraqi military intelligence officer\u2019s ties to Iran and had limited his access to sensitive information.\n\u2018The Americans\u2019 candidate\u2019\nBy late 2014, the United States was once again pouring weapons and soldiers into Iraq as it began battling the Islamic State. Iran, too, had an interest in defeating the militants. As ISIS took control of the west and the north, young Iraqi men traveled across the deserts and marshes of the south by the busload, heading to Iran for military training.\nSome within the American and Iranian governments believed the two rivals should coordinate their efforts against a common enemy. But Iran, as the leaked cables make clear, also viewed the increased American presence as a threat and a \u201ccover\u201d to gather intelligence about Iran.\n\u201cWhat is happening in the sky over Iraq shows the massive level of activity of the coalition,\u201d one Iranian officer wrote. \u201cThe danger for the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s interests represented by their activity must be taken seriously.\u201d\nThe rise of ISIS was at the same time driving a wedge between the Obama administration and a large swath of the Iraqi political class. Mr. Obama had pushed for the ouster of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki as a condition for renewed American military support. He believed Mr. al-Maliki\u2019s draconian policies and crackdowns on Iraqi Sunnis had helped lead to the rise of the militants.\nMr. al-Maliki, who had lived in exile in Iran in the 1980s, was a favorite of Tehran\u2019s. His replacement, the British-educated Haider al-Abadi, was seen as more friendly to the West and less sectarian. Facing the uncertainty of a new prime minister, Hassan Danaiefar, then Iran\u2019s ambassador, called a secret meeting of senior staffers at the Iranian Embassy, a hulking, fortified structure just outside Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone.\nAs the meeting progressed, it became clear the Iranians had little cause to worry about the new Iraqi government. Mr. Al-Abadi was dismissed as \u201ca British man,\u201d and \u201cthe Americans\u2019 candidate,\u201d but the Iranians believed they had plenty of other ministers in their pocket.\nOne by one, Mr. Danaiefar went down the list of cabinet members, describing their relationships to Iran.\nIbrahim al-Jafari \u2014 who had previously served as Iraqi prime minister and by late 2014 was the foreign minister \u2014 was, like Mr. Mahdi, identified as having a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Iran. In an interview, Mr. al-Jafari did not deny that he had close relations with Iran, but said he had always dealt with foreign countries based on the interests of Iraq.\nIran counted on the loyalty of many lesser cabinet members as well.\nThe report said the ministers of municipalities, communications and human rights \u201care in complete harmony and at one with us and are our people.\u201d The environment minister, it said, \u201cworks with us, although he is Sunni.\u201d The transportation minister \u2014 Bayan Jabr, who had led the Iraqi Interior Ministry at a time when hundreds of prisoners were tortured to death with electric drills or summarily shot by Shiite death squads \u2014 was deemed to be \u201cvery close\u201d to Iran. When it came to Iraq\u2019s education minister, the report says, \u201cwe will have no problem with him.\u201d\nThe former ministers of municipalities, communications and human rights were all members of the Badr Organization, a political and military group established by Iran in the 1980s to oppose Saddam Hussein. The former minister of municipalities denied having a close relationship with Iran; the former human rights minister acknowledged being close to Iran, and praised Iran for helping Shiite Iraqis during Mr. Hussein\u2019s dictatorship, and for help defeating the Islamic State. The former minister of communications said that he served Iraq, not Iran, and that he maintained relationships with diplomats from many countries; the former minister of education said that he had not been supported by Iran, and that he served at the request of Prime Minister al-Abadi. The former environment minister could not be reached for comment.\nIran\u2019s dominance over Iraqi politics is vividly shown in one important episode from the fall of 2014, when Baghdad was a city at the center of a multinational maelstrom. The Syrian civil war was raging to the west, Islamic State militants had seized almost a third of Iraq and American troops were heading back to the region to confront the growing crisis.\nAgainst this chaotic backdrop, Mr. Jabr, then the transportation minister, welcomed General Suleimani, the Quds Force commander, to his office. General Suleimani had come to ask a favor: Iran needed access to Iraqi airspace to fly planeloads of weapons and other supplies to support the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad in its fight against American-backed rebels.\nIt was a request that placed Mr. Jabr at the center of the longstanding rivalry between the United States and Iran. Obama administration officials had been lobbying hard to get the Iraqis to stop Iranian flights through their airspace, but face to face with the Quds chief, Iraq\u2019s transportation minister found it impossible to refuse.\nGeneral Suleimani, Mr. Jabr recalled, \u201ccame to me and requested that we permit Iranian airplanes to use Iraqi air space to pass on to Syria,\u201d according to one of the cables. The transportation minister did not hesitate, and General Suleimani appeared to be pleased. \u201cI put my hands on my eyes and said, \u2018On my eyes! As you wish!\u2019\u201d Mr. Jabr told the intelligence ministry officer. \u201cThen he got up and approached me and kissed my forehead.\u201d\nMr. Jabr confirmed the meeting with General Suleimani, but said the flights from Iran to Syria carried humanitarian supplies and religious pilgrims traveling to Syria to visit holy sites, not weapons and military supplies to aid Mr. Assad as American officials believed.\nMeanwhile, Iraqi officials known to have a relationship with the United States came under special scrutiny, and Iran took measures to counter American influence. Indeed, many of the files show that as top American diplomats met behind closed doors with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad, their conversations were routinely reported back to the Iranians.\nThroughout 2014 and 2015, as a new Iraqi government settled in, the American ambassador, Stuart Jones, met often with Salim al-Jabouri, who was speaker of the Iraqi Parliament until last year. Mr. al-Jabouri, although he is Sunni, was known to have a close relationship with Iran, but the files now reveal that one of his top political advisers \u2014 identified as Source 134832 \u2014 was an Iranian intelligence asset. \u201c[I] am present in his office on a daily basis and carefully follow his contacts with the Americans,\u201d the source told his Iranian handler. Mr. al-Jabouri, in an interview, said he did not believe that anyone on his staff had worked as an agent for Iran, and that he fully trusted his aides. (Mr. Jones declined to comment.)\nThe source urged the Iranians to develop closer ties to Mr. al-Jabouri, to blunt American efforts to nurture a new class of younger Sunni leaders in Iraq and perhaps bring about reconciliation between Sunnis and Shias. The source warned that Iran should act to keep the Parliament speaker from \u201cslipping into a pro-American position, since one of Salim al-Jabouri\u2019s characteristics is credulousness and making hasty decisions.\u201d\nAnother report reveals that Nechervan Barzani, then the prime minister of Kurdistan, met with top American and British officials and Mr. al-Abadi, the Iraqi prime minister, in Baghdad in December 2014, and then went almost immediately to meet with an Iranian official to tell him everything. Through a spokesman, Mr. Barzani said he did not recall meeting with any Iranian officials at the time, and described the cable as \u201cbaseless and unfounded.\u201d He said he \u201cabsolutely denies\u201d telling the Iranians details about his conversations with American and British diplomats.\nSometimes, the Iranians also saw trade value in the information they received from their Iraqi sources.\nOne report from the al-Jabouri adviser revealed that the United States was interested in gaining access to a rich natural gas field in Akkas, near Iraq\u2019s border with Syria. The source explained that the Americans might eventually try to export the natural gas to Europe, a major market for Russian natural gas. Intrigued, the intelligence ministry officer, in a cable to Tehran, wrote, \u201cIt is recommended that the aforementioned information be used in exchange with the Russians and Syria.\u201d The cable was written just as Russia was significantly stepping up its involvement in Syria, and as Iran continued its military buildup there, in support of President al-Assad.\nAnd although Iran was initially suspicious of Mr. al-Abadi\u2019s allegiances, a report written a few months after his rise to the premiership suggested that he was quite willing to have a confidential relationship with Iranian intelligence. A January 2015 report details a private meeting between al-Abadi and an intelligence ministry officer known as Boroujerdi, held in the prime minister\u2019s office \u201cwithout the presence of a secretary or a third person.\u201d\nDuring the meeting, Boroujerdi homed in on Iraq\u2019s Sunni-Shia divide, probing Mr. al-Abadi\u2019s feelings on perhaps the most sensitive subject in Iraqi politics. \u201cToday, the Sunnis find themselves in the worst possible circumstances and have lost their self-confidence,\u201d the intelligence officer opined, according to the cable. \u201cThe Sunnis are vagrants, their cities are destroyed and an unclear future awaits them, while the Shias can retrieve their self-confidence.\u201d\nIraq\u2019s Shia were \u201cat a historical turning point,\u201d Boroujerdi continued. The Iraqi government and Iran could \u201ctake advantage of this situation.\u201d\nAccording to the cable, the prime minister expressed his \u201ccomplete agreement.\u201d Mr. Abadi declined to comment.\n\u2018Sweetness into bitterness\u2019\nEver since the start of the Iraq War in 2003, Iran has put itself forward as the protector of Iraq\u2019s Shiites, and General Suleimani, more than anyone else, has employed the dark arts of espionage and covert military action to ensure that Shiite power remains ascendant. But it has come at the cost of stability, with Sunnis perennially disenfranchised and looking to other groups, like the Islamic State, to protect them.\nA 2014 massacre of Sunnis in the farming community of Jurf al-Sakhar was a vivid example of the kinds of sectarian atrocities committed by armed groups loyal to Iran\u2019s Quds Force that had alarmed the United States throughout the Iraq War, and undermined efforts at reconciliation. As the field reports make clear, some of the Americans\u2019 concerns were shared by the Iranian intelligence ministry. That signaled divisions within Iran over its Iraq policies between more moderate elements under President Hassan Rouhani and militant factions like the Revolutionary Guards.\n\u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0647 \u0639\u0645\u0648\u0645\u06cc \u062c\u0631\u0641 \u0635\u062e\u0631 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0648 \u062d\u062a\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0647\u0627 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0627\u0632\u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u06a9\u0648\u0686\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u062a\u0648\u0633\u0637 \u0646\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u062a\u062e\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0642\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0622\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u062e\u0631\u06cc\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0646\u062f \u06af\u0631\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0631\u062e\u06cc \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u062e\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u06cc\u0634\u0647 \u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u0633\u0648\u0632\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u0648\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0636\u0648\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u067e\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0632\u0644 \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u062e\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u0633\u0631 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u062f\u062f. \u0627\u062d\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0647 (\u06af\u0627\u0648 \u06af\u0648\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062f) \u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0642\u0627\u0637 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u067e\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u062f\u0648\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628 \u0645\u0634\u063a\u0648\u0644 \u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f.\nThe area around Jurf Al-Sakhar has been cleansed of terrorist agents. Their families have been driven away, most of their houses have been destroyed by military forces and the rest will be destroyed. In some places, the palm orchards have been uprooted to be burned to prevent the terrorists from taking shelter among the trees.\nThe people\u2019s livestock (cows and sheep) have been scattered and are grazing without their owners.\nJurf al-Sakhar, which lies just east of Falluja in the Euphrates River Valley, is lush with orange trees and palm groves. It was overrun by the Islamic State in 2014, giving militants a foothold from which they could launch attacks on the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf.\nJurf al-Sakhar is also important to Iran because it lies on a route Shiite religious pilgrims use to travel to Karbala during Muharram, the monthlong commemoration of the death of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Imam Hussein, a revered figure for Shiites.\nWhen Shiite militias supported by Iran drove the militants out of Jurf al-Sakhar in late 2014, the first major victory over the Islamic State, it became a ghost town. It was no longer a threat to the thousands of Shiite pilgrims who would pass by, but Iran\u2019s victory came at a high cost to the town\u2019s Sunni residents. Tens of thousands were displaced, and a local politician, the only Sunni member on the provincial council, was found with a bullet hole through his head.\nOne cable describes the damage in almost biblical terms. \u201cAs a result of these operations,\u201d its author reported, \u201cthe area around Jurf al-Sakhar has been cleansed of terrorist agents. Their families have been driven away, most of their houses have been destroyed by military forces and the rest will be destroyed. In some places, the palm orchards have been uprooted to be burned to prevent the terrorists from taking shelter among the trees. The people\u2019s livestock (cows and sheep) have been scattered and are grazing without their owners.\u201d\nThe Jurf al-Sakhar operation and other bloody actions led by Iran\u2019s proxies and directed by Tehran further alienated Iraq\u2019s Sunni population, according to one report, which notes that \u201cdestroying villages and houses, looting the Sunnis\u2019 property and livestock turned the sweetness of these successes\u201d against the Islamic State into \u201cbitterness.\u201d One of the Jurf al-Sakhar cables cast the impact of Shiite militias in particularly stark terms: \u201cIn all the areas where the Popular Mobilization Forces go into action, the Sunnis flee, abandoning their homes and property, and prefer to live in tents as refugees or reside in camps.\u201d\nThe intelligence ministry feared that Iran\u2019s gains in Iraq were being squandered because Iraqis so resented the Shia militias and the Quds Force that sponsored them. Above all, its officers blamed General Suleimani, whom they saw as a dangerous self-promoter using the anti-ISIS campaign as a launching pad for a political career back home in Iran. One report, which states at the top that it is not to be shared with the Quds Force, criticizes the general personally for publicizing his leading role in the military campaign in Iraq by \u201cpublishing pictures of himself on different social media sites.\u201d\nDoing that had made it obvious that Iran controlled the dreaded Shia militias \u2014 a potential gift to its rivals. \u201cThis policy of Iran in Iraq,\u201d the report said, \u201chas allowed the Americans to return to Iraq with greater legitimacy. And groups and individuals who had been fighting against the Americans among the Sunnis are now wishing that not only America, but even Israel, would enter Iraq and save Iraq from Iran\u2019s clutches.\u201d\nAt times, the Iranians sought to counter the ill will generated by their presence in Iraq with soft-power campaigns similar to American battlefield efforts to win \u201chearts and minds.\u201d Hoping to gain a \u201cpropaganda advantage and restore Iran\u2019s image among the people,\u201d Iran devised a plan to send pediatricians and gynecologists to villages in northern Iraq to administer health services, according to one field report. It is not clear, however, if that initiative materialized.\n\u0636\u0631\u0648\u0631\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u062d\u062f \u0648 \u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u0644\u0648\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0634\u0648\u0646\u062a \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u0641\u0631\u0627\u062f \u0628\u06cc \u06af\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u062f\u0631\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642 \u0648 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a \u0622\u0642\u0627\u06cc \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u06cc \u062e\u0634\u0648\u0646\u062a \u0648 \u062f\u0631\u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u06cc\u0639\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0646\u06cc \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u062d\u0627\u0636\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0639\u0644\u06cc\u0647 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u062a \u0628\u0647 \u062d\u0633\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u06cc \u0634\u0648\u062f\u066c \u0686\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u06cc\u0645 \u0648 \u063a\u06cc\u0631 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u06cc\u0645 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0646\u0642\u0634 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0648 \u06cc\u0627 \u0646\u0642\u0634\u06cc \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f.\nWe must think about limiting violence against innocent Sunnis in Iraq and limiting Mr. Soleimani\u2019s measures, or else violence and strife between Shiites and Sunnis will continue. Currently, any actions taken against Sunnis will be blamed on Iran, whether Iran had a direct or indirect role in it, or none at all.\nJust as often, Iran would use its influence to close lucrative development deals. With Iraq dependent on Iran for military support in the fight against the Islamic State, one cable shows the Quds Force receiving oil and development contracts from Iraq\u2019s Kurds in exchange for weapons and other aid. In the south, Iran was awarded contracts for sewage and water purification by paying a $16 million bribe to a member of Parliament, according to another field report.\nToday, Iran is struggling to maintain its hegemony in Iraq, just as the Americans did after the 2003 invasion. Iraqi officials, meanwhile, are increasingly worried that a provocation in Iraq on either side could set off a war between the two powerful countries vying for dominance in their homeland. Against this geopolitical backdrop, Iraqis learned long ago to take a pragmatic approach to the overtures of Iran\u2019s spies \u2014 even Sunni Iraqis who view Iran as an enemy.\n\u201cNot only doesn\u2019t he believe in Iran, but he doesn\u2019t believe that Iran might have positive intentions toward Iraq,\u201d one Iranian case officer wrote in late 2014, about an Iraqi intelligence recruit described as a Baathist who had once worked for Saddam Hussein and later the C.I.A. \u201cBut he is a professional spy and understands the reality of Iran and the Shia in Iraq and will collaborate to save himself.\u201d\nThis story was reported in partnership with The Intercept, where James Risen is the senior national security correspondent and Murtaza Hussain is a reporter.\nAdditional Reporting: Matthew Cole and Laura Secor for The Intercept; Rick Gladstone, Falih Hassan and Alissa J.

This week, Times Opinion is reporting on a huge trove of location data showing the precise location movements for millions of Americans.\nOnce your location is shared with the companies, there\u2019s no way to delete that information or get it back. Your best bet is to avoid sharing your location in the first place \u2014 at least until the government bestirs itself to begin regulating how that information is collected, used and sold.\n1\nStop sharing your location with apps\nThe most important thing you can do now is to disable location sharing for apps already on your phone. (Don\u2019t worry, your phone will automatically send its location to emergency responders if you dial 911.) It\u2019s easy to do this without having to open each app.\nSelect your device\nWe used a Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 9 for these instructions; the exact steps may vary slightly depending on your device.\nTo turn off location sharing, go to Settings Privacy Location Services. You can choose when to share your location for each app.\nTo turn off location sharing, go to Settings Biometrics and security App permissions Location. You can choose whether to share your location for each app.\nYou can also prevent your phone from sharing your location in the background. To do so, go to Settings General Background App Refresh. This will not affect your ability to receive push notifications.\nMany apps that request your location, like weather, coupon or local news apps, often work just fine without it. There\u2019s no reason a weather app, for instance, needs your precise, second-by-second location to provide forecasts for your city.\nApple has recently made it harder for companies to snoop on your whereabouts via backdoor methods like checking for nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks. Make sure your phone\u2019s operating system is updated to benefit from these safeguards.\n2\nDisable your mobile ad ID\nYour online activity is often tied together and tracked using your mobile advertising ID, which is a unique number created by your phone and sent to advertisers and app makers.\nSince location data is sent along with your ad ID, it can be tied to other data about you. You can disable this feature entirely in your privacy settings, limiting the ways companies can tie your activities together.\nGo to Settings Privacy Advertising and turn on Limit Ad Tracking.\nGo to Settings Google Ads and then turn on Opt out of Ads Personalization.\n3\nPrevent Google from storing your location\nIf you have a Google account, the company may already have saved a trove of location data tied to your devices. You can prevent Google from collecting this information by going to your account\u2019s location activity controls and turning off location sharing.\n4\nUnderstand location tracking is hard to avoid\nYou can do only so much. Location vendors are engaged in a race to find new ways to ferret out your devices, regardless of whether you followed the steps above. Some will try to identify you using your device type, I.P. address, screen size and even volume and screen brightness, in a process called \u201cfingerprinting.\u201d\nYour mobile carrier also collects location pings while your phone is turned on, regardless of whether you followed the steps above. Telecom companies were recently caught selling that data to companies that then resold it to bounty hunters, who used it to find phones in real time. The telecom companies have since pledged to stop selling the data, but they still collect it.\nInterested in doing more to keep your location to yourself? Try the Privacy Pro SmartVPN app, which allows users to monitor apps and block them from additional forms of data sharing.\nReal protections will come only if federal laws are passed to limit what companies can do with the data they collect. Until then, no matter what settings we choose, we\u2019re all at risk.\nCorrection: Jan. 13, 2020\nAn earlier version of this article included a technique for preventing location sharing on smartphones in error.

What is happening here is happening across the country. Nationally, high school participation in 11-man football has fallen more than 10 percent since 2009.\nIt is falling all over the country: on the coasts and in the heartland, in the Upper Midwest and in the Deep South, and in California, Florida and Texas.\nFootball has long been a fundamental part of the American identity, and it likely will be for years to come. But it has become mired in controversy over safety, and it has to compete harder each year with the popularity of other sports. In Maiden and elsewhere, the joyous Friday nights and Saturday afternoons remain, but they are different now.\nOn a December morning in 2017, some of the most powerful men in football gathered at a Midtown hotel in New York with a vital mission: to save their sport.\nRobert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, was there, as was the commissioner of the N.F.L., Roger Goodell. Commissioners from the Power 5 college athletic conferences were in the room. So were Northwestern\u2019s head coach, Pat Fitzgerald, and a pair of Hall of Famers turned business titans, Roger Staubach and Archie Manning.\nThat these men felt compelled to turn the gathering, an annual meeting of the National Football Foundation, into a strategy session for pushing back against the forces threatening their game illustrates the dramatic disruption football has undergone in the past decade. Over that time, the public\u2019s awareness of football\u2019s role in some forms of long-term brain damage has potentially become the sport\u2019s kryptonite.\nThere was no table-pounding, no hand-wringing. But there was a sense of urgency.\n\u201cIf we stand for anything, it\u2019s to protect the game, so let\u2019s step off the curb and get to work,\u201d said Steve Hatchell, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, summing up the mood in the room that day.\nFootball is still the most popular high school sport among boys.\nFootball remains far and away the country\u2019s most popular sport. It garners huge television audiences every week, and more children play it than any other sport. But participation in youth leagues is dropping. Over the last decade, the number of high school boys playing tackle football \u2014 the heart and soul of the sport \u2014 has dropped more than 10 percent. The people who play the game are changing, too, with the number of white players diminishing as black and Hispanic players increasingly make up a larger plurality of the player pool.\nWhite high school boys make up a smaller share of football players.\nHarder to measure is how fans perceive the game, but clearly football has become yet another thing that people are for or against. Several states are considering whether young people should even play the tackle version of the sport at all, as they weigh legislation to impose minimum age requirements for playing.\nAs research on the damage football causes to young athletes grows and stories about the diminished capabilities of former N.F.L. greats continue to be a vital part of the sports conversation, some parents have come to fear that they may be putting their children in danger by letting them play football.\nThose forces make securing the future of the sport a substantial challenge. Football participation is down even in unexpected places, while soccer and cross-country running have grown significantly.\nFootball participation is down in states that typically feed the N.F.L.\nIn Texas, the state that gave us $70 million high school stadiums and \u201cFriday Night Lights,\u201d football participation is down 10 percent. Ohio has produced the fourth highest total of N.F.L. players, but participation has dropped 27 percent in the Buckeye State. Eight Ohio high schools were unable to fill squads to play even eight-man football last year.\nKansas, stricken with budget cuts, has seen participation fall 13 percent. With that decline, expensive football programs have become an easy target for school boards looking to save money. The state now has 12 schools playing six-man football.\nIt\u2019s impossible to nail down one reason for the decline. Specialization has hurt all sports, as has the growth of video games and e-sports.\nIt is also impossible, however, to ignore the impact of health and safety, especially when it comes to brain injuries.\nNot only are high school boys almost twice as likely to sustain a head injury in football during a game compared with the next closest sport, but they also are more likely to get a head injury in football than any other injury in any other sport recorded in the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study.\nThis is how Caine Houser, the athletic director at Maiden High School in North Carolina, in the heart of a breeding ground for many top college programs, summed up the psyche that his staff has to battle: \u201cParents are scared of head injuries, and rightly so.\u201d\nHere are the most common injuries for boys\u2019 basketball.\nIn boys\u2019 soccer, 11 head injuries take place every 10,000 competition plays.\nBoys\u2019 hockey has the second highest rate of head injuries.\nBoys\u2019 football has the highest rate of head injuries, nearly double that of hockey.\nCommon injuries for boys among popular high school sports\nInjuries per 10,000 competition plays\nThe New York Times commissioned a national online poll of 1,000 14- to 17-year-old boys. The survey, conducted by Pollfish and PredictWise this fall, found 9 percent of those who identified themselves as football players said they had parents who voiced concerns over head injuries, compared with 3 percent of wrestlers and 2 percent of hockey players. Still, only 4 percent of boys who had quit football said that personal concerns over head injuries were the main reason they quit. A third of former players said they just lost interest, another third became busy with something else and 15 percent said they simply started playing another sport.\nHouser said the number of players on the Maiden varsity football team had fallen to 30 from 39 since 2008. The decline, he said, is worse in neighboring districts where junior varsity teams have been shuttered. Parents are steering their children into sports that they can play year-round, like baseball and basketball, to give them a leg up on making a college team.\nEven though coaches have tried to address their concerns by teaching new tackling techniques and monitoring head injuries closely, Houser said it could be very hard when \u201cparents get caught up in the \u2018let\u2019s don\u2019t take a chance\u2019 thing.\u201d\nThe headwinds are real, but football is still operating from a position of strength. In 2018, for example, nine of the top 10 most-watched prime-time broadcasts were N.F.L. or college football games. Football\u2019s golden age may be behind it, but whether it is in a slow fade, on the verge of a renaissance or heading for a collapse is a matter of debate.\nIn the coming weeks, The Times will examine football\u2019s hold on America, among children and their parents in the heartland, at public high schools and elite colleges.\nA significant decline in football\u2019s prominence would represent an important cultural shift in America. The sport long ago surpassed baseball as the true national pastime, both in terms of participation and fanaticism, and seeing its numbers drop represents a chance to understand in real time how quickly the ground can shift.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, boxing and horse racing ruled, then suddenly they did not. Few understood or explored the dynamics \u2014 safety concerns were growing, and entertainment options were increasing \u2014 while they were underway.\nCertainly, the 30 or so National Football Foundation board members in the room that morning two Decembers ago understood that they had to try to change the narrative surrounding their game. All were volunteers. All were there on their own dime. Most had played the game, and credited the lessons they learned on the field for their success. They were savvy businesspeople, and many were invested in keeping the sport a multibillion-dollar industry at the top of the nation\u2019s entertainment pyramid.\nThe organization was founded in 1947, when football was ascendant, by a war hero, a coach and a sportswriter: Gen. Douglas MacArthur; Army\u2019s coach, Red Blaik; and Grantland Rice of The New York Herald Tribune. They wanted to make sure football inhabited a sacred place in the American psyche. Its mission was straightforward: to promote football as a way to mold future leaders through sportsmanship, competition and academic excellence.\nBy the time that December 2017 meeting had ended, football\u2019s power brokers had decided to try to make that mission relevant in the 21st century.\nWithin weeks, money had started to roll in. Kraft and Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys and a foundation board member, along with Goodell, on behalf of the N.F.L., came up with several hundred thousand dollars. The N.C.A.A commissioners pledged to set aside money from the College Football Playoff. Several doctors offered their counsel, including those skeptical of research linking repeated head hits to degenerative brain disease.\nPractically overnight, rebranding football became perhaps the biggest part of the foundation\u2019s portfolio, next to maintaining the College Football Hall of Fame and honoring the academic achievements of collegiate football players.\nBy May 2018, the campaign #FootballMatters had begun to spread across multiple platforms. On the Football Matters website, there were resources for parents on rule changes and safety advances; articles about leadership and teamwork and overcoming adversity; and football-friendly data, such as the number of colleges that field football teams (775, with seven more being added by 2022) and the number of college players who are working on their master\u2019s degrees (1,439 out of about 73,000).\nEach Friday, fans who connect with Football Matters on social media get \u201chype videos\u201d of high school coaches\u2019 pregame talks to their teams. For casual fans, there is a documentary about Polynesian football or a YouTube video of a girls\u2019 tackle football league in Utah.\nThe five-year campaign has cost $2 million so far. The foundation\u2019s leaders say they have been careful not to allow the N.F.L. and the N.C.A.A., or their largess, to take the lead in a campaign aimed at everyday people. Is it working? It\u2019s too early to tell. Television ratings are rebounding after a period of decline, but participation has continued to fall.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to change anyone\u2019s minds, but we hope to put football in a fuller context and give people enough information to make their own decisions,\u201d said Ken Luce, the founding partner of LDWW, the marketing agency based in Dallas that is running the campaign.\nOthers in the sport who want to maintain football\u2019s prominence have redoubled their efforts to build a better helmet, but the structure of the human head \u2014 hard skull, soft brain \u2014 makes that challenging. Pop Warner is pushing the idea that tackling can be safer, though many neuroscientists are skeptical. Teams and coaches at every level are decreasing the number of contact practices because scientists increasingly warn of the risk of not just concussions but also repeated head and body hits. No one knows how much is too much.\n\u201cWe are facing a lot of issues \u2014 the biggest one is that you can get hurt playing football,\u201d Hatchell, the foundation\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cBut we have decided to be a player in the conversation. To push back.\u201d\nHatchell concedes that the foundation \u2014 and all of the game\u2019s boosters \u2014 need to be nimble and aggressive in telling people that their game is changing for the better. \u201cIt\u2019s still the most popular sport out there,\u201d Hatchell said. \u201cSo how do we continue to build on it?\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

She pulled into the lot of the Pasadena Waldorf School in Altadena, Calif., at 10:26 a.m. It was a gorgeous, clear morning, and she and hundreds of others walked among the bales of hay and suits of armor decorating the grounds for the annual holiday Elves\u2019 Faire. At 12:49 p.m. she pulled out of the lot, heading back down East Mariposa Street the way she came.\nAll afternoon the city hummed in every direction. Across town, K. was en route to a lunch at Din Tai Fung, a Taiwanese restaurant in Arcadia where he\u2019d arrive at 1:34 p.m. for a 54-minute lunch. M. stopped at Pasadena City College briefly, then made a trip to Home Depot. Others, like C. and J., went to church. There were evening errands: After a day with family, A. popped into a CVS at 6:57 p.m. C. took an evening trip to Costco. T. made a stop at AutoZone in Rosemead. Hundreds more shopped, ate, walked in the park, visited doctors\u2019 offices and coffee shops, and a few checked into hotels at odd hours.\nThe only thing out of the ordinary for the good people of Pasadena, Calif., about this particular Saturday is that three years later and 3,000 miles away in a newsroom, Times Opinion watched their every move unfold all over again. Minute by minute and inch by inch.\nWe pieced together some stories from Pasadena over a period of several months. Our eye in the sky wasn\u2019t a network of traffic cams or satellites but data exhaust spewing from smartphone apps buried in the pockets and purses of unsuspecting Americans.\nThe Times Privacy Project was given access to a data set with more than 50 billion location \u201cpings\u201d from the phones of more than 12 million Americans across several major cities. Each piece of information came down to a set of coordinates in time. The result is a tapestry of movement laid across a city grid \u2014 like the computer game SimCity, only real.\nThis granular location data \u2014 the kind that is collected by hundreds of mobile apps and then shared with dozens of location data brokers \u2014 may seem like a catalog of the mundane. But the aggregate is closer to total surveillance \u2014 an exact record of the rhythms of a living, breathing community.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nModern data surveillance relies on the ease of gathering but also the capacity to analyze giant sets of numbers. Run a set of numbers through a computer and the data becomes far more personal and invasive. Data points become a diary. A cluster of pings inside a secure facility reveals clues to the secretive role of an aerospace engineer. Visits to places of worship, trips to Planned Parenthood, a late-night visit to a bail bondsman \u2014 all collected in perpetuity and logged forever to be analyzed, traded and monetized. Each mark of latitude and longitude tells the story of the triumphs and tribulations of a life.\nAmericans would never consent to a government directive that all citizens carry a device that broadcast, in real time, their physical location and archived that information in repositories that could be shared among powerful, faceless institutions. Instead, Americans have been lulled into doing it voluntarily by misleading companies.\nIf a mobile phone is turned on, chances are its location is collected in a spreadsheet somewhere. What does it feel like to see that archive? We went to Pasadena to find out.\nTake away the temperate, cloudless days, the 90,000-plus people who pack the Rose Bowl at the start of each year and the imposing presence of the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, and Pasadena could be anywhere. Which is, in part, why we chose Pasadena. The data doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2014 it\u2019s collected from every town and city in America. Situated 11 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles and in the county of the same name, Pasadena is both of the city and not. Hollywood celebrities live there, but mostly to escape the crush of the Greater Los Angeles sprawl.\nThe city changes by the block. Palm-tree-lined streets with manicured lawns give way to suburban sprawl, drive-through liquor stores and laundromats. There are wildfires and gentrification. NASA and Caltech map the depths of the universe from here, while the public school district tries to provide a soft landing for a large influx of foster children.\nDan Paige, a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, has to look after all of it. As a member of the city\u2019s Homeless Outreach, Search and Rescue, and the Community Emergency Response Team, he\u2019s accustomed to being the person doing the tracking. But without his knowledge a series of apps on his phone had been silently, scrupulously relaying his location. When we emailed to say we were in town and had a map of his movements, Mr. Paige agreed to meet. He didn\u2019t bother providing the station\u2019s address. \u201cHopefully with that data you have, you can track my exact location,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. Paige took over managing the Sheriff\u2019s Station social media accounts in 2012, and so he carries two phones and an iPad most of the time. In a dimly lit room where we met, he drummed his fingers on his county-issue iPhone 6 and let out a resigned laugh as we showed him a detailed map of his movements over a few months: shuttling to the dry cleaners, then to lunch downtown followed by a stop at Search and Rescue headquarters and finally to a E.M.T. training at a Glendale community college. When we showed him the thick red lines drawing a direct route from the police station to his home, he winced.\n\u201cIt is a little surprising,\u201d he confessed. As a law enforcement officer, he was concerned about possible threats against him and his family. In his line of work, any record of his home, as well as of the stores and restaurants he frequents, is a vulnerability.\nMr. Paige is not a stranger to technology and privacy. He meticulously strips photos of their metadata before posting them to the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s Twitter or Facebook accounts. He checks his permissions and helps educate fellow officers. But though he turns location services off on most of his apps, he\u2019s aware that it takes only one slip-up to transmit his exact coordinates \u2014 like everyone, he\u2019s only as secure as the weakest link in his chain of downloaded apps. \u201cWhenever you agree to an app, there's those eight pages of two-point font to read and, yeah, I'm guilty of not reading \u2014 just hit \u2018accept\u2019 and roll the dice,\u201d he said.\nAs they go about their daily lives, many Pasadena residents we spoke with, like the rest of us, frequent locations whose populations for one reason or another could be vulnerable \u2014 because they attend mosques or synagogues or work at secure facilities, like NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We plucked one scientist at the lab out of the data, and when we tracked him down in real life and explained how we did it, he was alarmed. \u201cSomebody who might want to get some information from [the lab] for instance, they might target me,\u201d the scientist told us. \u201cThis will be a treasure trove for any spying agency, I would presume.\u201d He asked that we preserve his anonymity in this story.\nFor Mr. Paige, seeing his location map laid out before him crystallized the risks to the community he has sworn to protect. He mused about the judges he knew in town, the prosecutors, the Hollywood celebrities and even the clergy whom someone might want to target. \u201cIf you were to compile a list of all the people that you feel could be vulnerable, it would probably be quite a few groups,\u201d he told us.\nAll of it seemed, to him, more than a little out of control. \u201cYou have that feeling of it being out of your hands,\u201d he said.\nAmong the most sensitive and vulnerable populations under Mr. Paige\u2019s guard is the student body at John Muir High, a labyrinth of classrooms tucked against the San Fernando Freeway. When we arrived, the din from a nearby on-ramp was drowned out by the Muir drumline, which was putting the finishing touches on a routine for the playoff football game against Chaffey High School that evening. The principal, Lawton Gray, was presiding over it all, wearing a Mustangs T-shirt for the occasion.\nAt Muir, 79 percent of the students are listed by the Pasadena school district as \u201csocioeconomically disadvantaged,\u201d and Dr. Gray, who is fiercely protective of the kids, has no shortage of concerns. He does home visits to help students who are struggling with their school work or their family lives.\nWe went into the school, sat down with Dr. Gray at a table in his office and pulled up the dataset for John Muir High \u2014 roughly 80 cellphones pinging across a six-month period. His eyes widened and he put his elbows on the table for a closer look at the laptop screen. \u201cWait, they\u2019re tracking individual cell phones? Oh, that\u2019s scary,\u201d he said. His eyes intensely scanned the screen. At first, he wasn\u2019t sure what was in front of him. He stopped on a particular clustering of pings, peppered across Muir High School and the surrounding area. \u201cWait. This isn\u2019t just everybody? This is for one person?\u201d Yes, we told him. His voice went hushed. \u201cOh, shit.\u201d\nAfter a minute, he exhaled, and referred to a certain movie from 20 years ago that we also find ourselves thinking a lot about these days. \u201cThis is almost like \u2018Enemy of the State,\u2019\u201d he said.\nHis thoughts went to the kids he knew who were having trouble with an abusive parent. \u201cI just think about those families,\u201d he said, letting out a short, exasperated sigh. \u201cIf there's child abuse or there's something going on and this parent has access to find out where this kid is even though they're not supposed to. That's what bothers me the most. Because I do know those situations.\u201d\nMany parents probably aren\u2019t aware of this, but there are only weak rules and regulations prohibiting the location tracking of minors. Many terms-of-service agreements for apps prohibit people younger than 13 from creating accounts, but it\u2019s really up to the kids and their families to enforce such rules. And with technology now everywhere in the classroom \u2014 much of it, like laptops, provided by some school districts \u2014 parents may not be aware how connected their children really are.\nDr. Gray zoomed out to see one device \u2014 very likely carried by a Muir student \u2014 and its lengthy data trail, a tangle of lines traversing the greater Los Angeles area. \u201cThere are no valid reasons that someone can tell me right now as to why they need to collect this data for people that are under 18 years old,\u201d he said.\nPaging through an entire city\u2019s location data is disorienting. Initially, there\u2019s the surprise at the ease of pulling needles out of the digital haystack. Draw a box around any given location, isolate a date or time and voil\u00e0 \u2014 the bird\u2019s-eye details of a life sprawl out before you. The first thing to notice is the granularity \u2014 precise movements, sometimes down to the inch. The precision is what feels most unnerving. Watching employees move from the cafeteria to their office and then idling in the parking lot feels less like a justifiable marketing insight than it does a pillar of the panopticon.\nAt the spreadsheet level, the notion of location tracking is abstract, almost a thought experiment. Corporations, hungry for Big Data, view mapping every move as an aggregation. But as you drive through Pasadena\u2019s quiet sun-drenched streets, the surveillance becomes real. From this vantage, a location data map of Pasadena \u2014 or any town \u2014 takes on a darker quality. Each device and its pings are a detailed diary of a given day and also a dossier: intelligence collected on neighbors, parishioners or a fellow traveler in the produce section of the grocery store. Sanctified spaces like synagogues, churches and mosques are transformed from sacred gathering places into revealing data points. But such data are a blunt instrument, an inference or educated guess as to one\u2019s identity. Show up someplace once and you\u2019re forever associated with it in a database someplace, context be damned. We saw single visits to spaces where patrons probably thought their trip was lost to time and masked in the cover of night: a stroll into the Church of Scientology storefront, a late-night stop at a massage parlor. Now, forever, those visits are recorded in a database and often tied directly to a home address, viewable by anyone with access.\nThe collective nature of privacy has even made its way to local law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern for everybody,\u201d John Perez, Pasadena\u2019s chief of police, told us. He suggested a leak of such data could even turn neighbors against one another. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start destroying relationships with families and people. At the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be destroyed by it \u2014 and can we put it back together?\u201d\nAmericans don\u2019t have the vocabulary to adequately describe the experience and pervasiveness of digital surveillance. When we showed up on doorsteps, laptop in hand to inform people that their movements had been captured, sold and eventually supplied to us, many didn\u2019t know what to make of it. Shocked? In theory, yes. And yet many also assumed they\u2019d signed their data away long ago. Upset? Sometimes. They felt violated, but what could they really do about it? They were, when we visited them, alive and well, so how bad could it be? Many tried to describe a feeling but were unable to find the right words.\n\u201cI definitely don't like it,\u201d Linda Keavy, a schoolteacher, told us as she stood on her doorstep one Sunday afternoon. \u201cI don't know why they need that. And I don't know, I kind of get frustrated in that everything is about someone making money off of everything.\u201d\n\u201cAs sad as it is, it's kind of expected, I think,\u201d said Luis Chavez, an emergency-room technician. \u201cI'm sure a lot of people don't know that, they're just downloading some candy app, they have no idea.\u201d Mr. Chavez traced his data path and rattled off explanations for the pings. A trip to see a cousin. Commutes to the hospital. A few trips to the Subaru dealership where he bought his car.\nMr. Chavez, like others we spoke to, seemed mostly unconcerned about himself but worried more about others, like the patients who come into his emergency room and might be anxious about their privacy, which in theory is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. When we asked him what he\u2019d say to companies that collected the information, he was at a loss for words. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering, where does it go? It's too late to reclaim it now \u2014 it's just permanently out there. I don't know what I'd say.\u201d\nWhen confronted with their digital trail, people can get defensive. On doorsteps across Pasadena, people assured us they\u2019d already taken steps to protect themselves. They'd heard about Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, and they notice when they\u2019re followed around the internet with targeted ads. They weren\u2019t surprised, but many couldn\u2019t suppress a sheepishness when we explained that we\u2019d been looking at them, as if they\u2019d done something wrong or been exposed for sloppy digital hygiene. Despite our assurances that there\u2019s little way to escape at least some location tracking, many seemed to blame themselves for getting caught up in a dataset they had no idea existed.\nSome people we identified just shrugged off the news. They saw themselves as unimportant, and so they thought there was little risk anyone would ever go to the trouble of de-anonymizing their location data and using it against them. Some simply couldn\u2019t imagine harm coming from such information, even when the data exposed the most personal corners of their lives.\nLike most digitally savvy folks, Ed Honowitz, a former small-business owner, figured that precious pieces of his data were ricocheting around unknown servers. He told us that while the location map trail in our dataset was alarming to see, he wasn\u2019t quite surprised. \u201cIt's not like \u2018Oh my God, I had no idea this existed.\u2019\u201d\nOne man we identified in the data \u2014 M. \u2014 was so concerned about his privacy that he insisted we not identify him by name and meet him not at his house, which is in a gated community, but at his place of worship. Of all the data trails we tracked in the region, his told the most poignant story. It showed a series of visits to a hospital by two phones, one of which eventually disappeared from the data. The pings chronicled the progression of an illness that eventually claimed the life of M.\u2019s wife.\nHe squinted at the information spread out on the laptop before him. The movements of his late wife were cherished memories for him. Did it seem wrong that they could also be corporate intelligence to a marketer? M. just shrugged. The trials of her illness, as painful and private as they were at the time, were summed up in a public obituary. Ultimately, he argued, the data was already out in the world. It had already traveled so far. So what if it was now staring back at him through the screen?\nRobert Howell, a professor of philosophy at Southern Methodist University, has identified what he calls the Peeping Tom Effect to express the indifference many people feel toward data surveillance. He says we have a visceral reaction only \u201cwhen we think about living, breathing agents observing our private lives.\u201d It just doesn\u2019t feel like such a personal violation when \u201ccorporations are collecting the same information and storing it on their computers.\u201d\nThis psychological bias in favor of faceless surveillance may explain why Amazon\u2019s Alexa smart speaker faced such a backlash after reports revealed that Amazon hired thousands of people to listen to the recordings. Few people had seemed bothered that Amazon could store conversations for eternity and using them for targeted advertising or other profitable ends. That feeling curdled only when Alexa users learned that real people were listening in.\nIt\u2019s also possible that many people just feel as if they never had that much privacy to begin with, even before the era of mobile phones and ubiquitous corporate surveillance. Some security and privacy researchers, like Munish Walther-Puri, argue this is the reason average citizens are resigned to invasive practices like location tracking: \u201cWhat is the value of privacy if you never felt like you had it to begin with?\u201d\nAnd yet the data is ours. It comes from the phones we bought, on mobile networks we pay to use. It chronicles our movements and our lives. It may be used to manipulate our behavior by nudging us toward a particular purchase or political candidate. It may be leaked or hacked or bought or sold to bad actors and abused. If that happens, we, not the corporations who hold our data, will suffer personal consequences.\nSitting at her kitchen table, Margie Homer couldn\u2019t stop following her past self. \u201cThat was a birthday party,\u201d she said hovering a cursor over the details of a Saturday afternoon nearly three years ago. Her two cats nuzzled at our feet as she leaned in toward our laptop. \u201cThat's the cafeteria, and that's the building that I primarily work in.\u201d She was gesturing toward a sprawling complex of buildings that make up NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a secure facility roughly the size of a university where Dr. Homer, a chemist, works on projects for space stations.\nDr. Homer is no Luddite. At J.P.L., she\u2019s surrounded by state-of-the-art technology and an army of number crunchers and data miners. Privacy warnings have rubbed off on her \u2014 enough that she has resisted the constant pleas of her pre-teenage kids for a smartphone. Aside from the occasional tracking mandated by her favorite guilty pleasure, \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go,\u201d Dr. Homer assumed she\u2019d been a good steward of her location data.\nShe grabbed her Android off the table and started sifting through her apps, starting with those whose location permissions were set to \u201callowed all the time.\"\nCVS. Google Maps. Google search. Google V.R. services, which Dr. Homer didn\u2019t recall giving location permissions. Google Wifi and Chrome. Ikea. Amazon. AMC. Theaters. Pok\u00e9mon Go. She paused on an app from her school district that she hadn\u2019t realized had been hoovering up location data. \u201cThis is the problem with putting all this technology into people's hands when they don't really understand what's going on,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not stupid. In a sense, I saw it coming. People talk about it at work all the time. But it's a completely different thing when someone shows you a map.\u201d\nDr. Homer was outraged and frustrated. Scrolling through visits to friends and family, she worried that maybe her data might somehow reveal the information of those closest to her. She remembered political protests she attended \u2014 was her phone betraying activists around her? Staring at the data, it became easy to see what people frequently misunderstand: Privacy isn\u2019t just an individual matter. It\u2019s a collective concern. Dr. Homer\u2019s location wasn\u2019t just hers but was also intertwined with that of every person she\u2019d encountered.\nConsent is murky. Technically, each ping is collected legally, with the express consent of the device holder; apps can\u2019t collect GPS data unless you allow them to via a pop-up screen. But of the dozens of Pasadena residents we spoke with \u2014 even those unfazed by the detail of the data \u2014 none felt as though they\u2019d consented to this level of collection. \u201cUndoubtedly the whole industry benefits from the passivity of people, just not caring that much about what happens, or understanding, or worrying about it,\u201d said Mr. Honowitz, the former small-business owner we surprised with his data on his front porch.\n\u201cIf these companies actually walked us through their terms of service on these apps in a meaningful way, people would say: \u2018This is insane. I don't want to give you the right to do this,\u2019\u201d said Patrick Cahalan, a Pasadena School Board member.\nCollecting every scrap of our lives via smartphones is framed as a trade-off. If companies know where you are, they can serve you better information, like a personalized ad or a list of coffee shops near you. Pooling the data is even more useful. Companies can see trends, like traffic patterns, which may result in a faster commute. That\u2019s a persuasive argument.\nLocation tracking has always been an abstract idea. Consumers could never see behind the scenes and into the data.\nWhat happens when Americans parse the information companies actually collect on them? They begin to evaluate the true cost of their digital conveniences. For Dr. Homer the cost was this: the location of her home, her parents\u2019 house, her office, the site of a date and even her kids\u2019 favorite stalls at an annual holiday carnival. And while she\u2019s not entirely sure which app or apps was the culprit, she thinks it\u2019s entirely possible she traded it all for a few coupons for a reduced price on soup, the benefit she received for giving location permission to a hastily downloaded app.\nDr. Homer is lucky. What separates her from the tens of millions of us who\u2019ve traded our information is that she has seen the full exchange of values. Unlike the rest of us, she knows, down to the data point, the cost of her services rendered. Is it really worth it? That\u2019s a question not just people in Pasadena, but all of us, need to ask ourselves.\nCharlie Warzel (charlie.warzel@nytimes.com) is a writer at large for Opinion. Stuart A.

At the New York Stock Exchange \u2026\nof Los Angeles ...\nthe Pentagon \u2026\nTrump\u2019s Palm Beach resort.\nTwelve Million Phones, One Dataset, Zero Privacy\nEvery minute of every day, everywhere on the planet, dozens of companies \u2014 largely unregulated, little scrutinized \u2014 are logging the movements of tens of millions of people with mobile phones and storing the information in gigantic data files. The Times Privacy Project obtained one such file, by far the largest and most sensitive ever to be reviewed by journalists. It holds more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans as they moved through several major cities, including Washington, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nEach piece of information in this file represents the precise location of a single smartphone over a period of several months in 2016 and 2017. The data was provided to Times Opinion by sources who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so. The sources of the information said they had grown alarmed about how it might be abused and urgently wanted to inform the public and lawmakers.\n[Related: How to Track President Trump \u2014 Read more about the national security risks found in the data.]\nAfter spending months sifting through the data, tracking the movements of people across the country and speaking with dozens of data companies, technologists, lawyers and academics who study this field, we feel the same sense of alarm. In the cities that the data file covers, it tracks people from nearly every neighborhood and block, whether they live in mobile homes in Alexandria, Va., or luxury towers in Manhattan.\nOne search turned up more than a dozen people visiting the Playboy Mansion, some overnight. Without much effort we spotted visitors to the estates of Johnny Depp, Tiger Woods and Arnold Schwarzenegger, connecting the devices\u2019 owners to the residences indefinitely.\nIf you lived in one of the cities the dataset covers and use apps that share your location \u2014 anything from weather apps to local news apps to coupon savers \u2014 you could be in there, too.\nIf you could see the full trove, you might never use your phone the same way again.\nin New York City\nThe data reviewed by Times Opinion didn\u2019t come from a telecom or giant tech company, nor did it come from a governmental surveillance operation. It originated from a location data company, one of dozens quietly collecting precise movements using software slipped onto mobile phone apps. You\u2019ve probably never heard of most of the companies \u2014 and yet to anyone who has access to this data, your life is an open book. They can see the places you go every moment of the day, whom you meet with or spend the night with, where you pray, whether you visit a methadone clinic, a psychiatrist\u2019s office or a massage parlor.\nThe Times and other news organizations have reported on smartphone tracking in the past. But never with a data set so large. Even still, this file represents just a small slice of what\u2019s collected and sold every day by the location tracking industry \u2014 surveillance so omnipresent in our digital lives that it now seems impossible for anyone to avoid.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nIt doesn\u2019t take much imagination to conjure the powers such always-on surveillance can provide an authoritarian regime like China\u2019s. Within America\u2019s own representative democracy, citizens would surely rise up in outrage if the government attempted to mandate that every person above the age of 12 carry a tracking device that revealed their location 24 hours a day. Yet, in the decade since Apple\u2019s App Store was created, Americans have, app by app, consented to just such a system run by private companies. Now, as the decade ends, tens of millions of Americans, including many children, find themselves carrying spies in their pockets during the day and leaving them beside their beds at night \u2014 even though the corporations that control their data are far less accountable than the government would be.\n[Related: Where Even the Children Are Being Tracked \u2014 We followed every move of people in one city. Then we went to tell them.]\n\u201cThe seduction of these consumer products is so powerful that it blinds us to the possibility that there is another way to get the benefits of the technology without the invasion of privacy. But there is,\u201d said William Staples, founding director of the Surveillance Studies Research Center at the University of Kansas. \u201cAll the companies collecting this location information act as what I have called Tiny Brothers, using a variety of data sponges to engage in everyday surveillance.\u201d\nIn this and subsequent articles we\u2019ll reveal what we\u2019ve found and why it has so shaken us. We\u2019ll ask you to consider the national security risks the existence of this kind of data creates and the specter of what such precise, always-on human tracking might mean in the hands of corporations and the government. We\u2019ll also look at legal and ethical justifications that companies rely on to collect our precise locations and the deceptive techniques they use to lull us into sharing it.\nToday, it\u2019s perfectly legal to collect and sell all this information. In the United States, as in most of the world, no federal law limits what has become a vast and lucrative trade in human tracking. Only internal company policies and the decency of individual employees prevent those with access to the data from, say, stalking an estranged spouse or selling the evening commute of an intelligence officer to a hostile foreign power.\nCompanies say the data is shared only with vetted partners. As a society, we\u2019re choosing simply to take their word for that, displaying a blithe faith in corporate beneficence that we don\u2019t extend to far less intrusive yet more heavily regulated industries. Even if these companies are acting with the soundest moral code imaginable, there\u2019s ultimately no foolproof way they can secure the data from falling into the hands of a foreign security service. Closer to home, on a smaller yet no less troubling scale, there are often few protections to stop an individual analyst with access to such data from tracking an ex-lover or a victim of abuse.\nA DIARY OF YOUR EVERY MOVEMENT\nThe companies that collect all this information on your movements justify their business on the basis of three claims: People consent to be tracked, the data is anonymous and the data is secure.\nNone of those claims hold up, based on the file we\u2019ve obtained and our review of company practices.\nYes, the location data contains billions of data points with no identifiable information like names or email addresses. But it\u2019s child\u2019s play to connect real names to the dots that appear on the maps.\nHere\u2019s what that looks like.\nThe data included more\nthan 10,000 smartphones tracked\nin Central Park.\nHere is one smartphone, isolated\nfrom the crowd.\nHere are all pings from\nthat smartphone over the period covered by the data.\nConnecting those pings reveals a diary of the person\u2019s life.\nIn most cases, ascertaining a home location and an office location was enough to identify a person. Consider your daily commute: Would any other smartphone travel directly between your house and your office every day?\nDescribing location data as anonymous is \u201ca completely false claim\u201d that has been debunked in multiple studies, Paul Ohm, a law professor and privacy researcher at the Georgetown University Law Center, told us. \u201cReally precise, longitudinal geolocation information is absolutely impossible to anonymize.\u201d\n\u201cD.N.A.,\u201d he added, \u201cis probably the only thing that\u2019s harder to anonymize than precise geolocation information.\u201d\n[Work in the location tracking industry? Seen an abuse of data? We want to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, contact us on a secure line at 440-295-5934, @charliewarzel on Wire or email Charlie Warzel and Stuart A. Thompson directly.]\nYet companies continue to claim that the data are anonymous. In marketing materials and at trade conferences, anonymity is a major selling point \u2014 key to allaying concerns over such invasive monitoring.\nTo evaluate the companies\u2019 claims, we turned most of our attention to identifying people in positions of power. With the help of publicly available information, like home addresses, we easily identified and then tracked scores of notables. We followed military officials with security clearances as they drove home at night. We tracked law enforcement officers as they took their kids to school. We watched high-powered lawyers (and their guests) as they traveled from private jets to vacation properties. We did not name any of the people we identified without their permission.\nThe data set is large enough that it surely points to scandal and crime but our purpose wasn\u2019t to dig up dirt. We wanted to document the risk of underregulated surveillance.\nWatching dots move across a map sometimes revealed hints of faltering marriages, evidence of drug addiction, records of visits to psychological facilities.\nConnecting a sanitized ping to an actual human in time and place could feel like reading someone else\u2019s diary.\nIn one case, we identified Mary Millben, a singer based in Virginia who has performed for three presidents, including President Trump. She was invited to the service at the Washington National Cathedral the morning after the president\u2019s inauguration. That\u2019s where we first found her.\nShe remembers how, surrounded by dignitaries and the first family, she was moved by the music echoing through the recesses of the cathedral while members of both parties joined together in prayer. All the while, the apps on her phone were also monitoring the moment, recording her position and the length of her stay in meticulous detail. For the advertisers who might buy access to the data, the intimate prayer service could well supply some profitable marketing insights.\n\u201cTo know that you have a list of places I have been, and my phone is connected to that, that\u2019s scary,\u201d Ms. Millben told us. \u201cWhat\u2019s the business of a company benefiting off of knowing where I am? That seems a little dangerous to me.\u201d\nLike many people we identified in the data, Ms. Millben said she was careful about limiting how she shared her location. Yet like many of them, she also couldn\u2019t name the app that might have collected it. Our privacy is only as secure as the least secure app on our device.\n\u201cThat makes me uncomfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that makes every other person uncomfortable, to know that companies can have free rein to take your data, locations, whatever else they\u2019re using. It is disturbing.\u201d\n[Related: What\u2019s the Worst That Could Happen With My Phone Data? \u2014 Our journalists answers your questions about their investigation into how companies track smartphone users.]\nThe inauguration weekend yielded a trove of personal stories and experiences: elite attendees at presidential ceremonies, religious observers at church services, supporters assembling across the National Mall \u2014 all surveilled and recorded permanently in rigorous detail.\nProtesters were tracked just as rigorously. After the pings of Trump supporters, basking in victory, vanished from the National Mall on Friday evening, they were replaced hours later by those of participants in the Women\u2019s March, as a crowd of nearly half a million descended on the capital. Examining just a photo from the event, you might be hard-pressed to tie a face to a name. But in our data, pings at the protest connected to clear trails through the data, documenting the lives of protesters in the months before and after the protest, including where they lived and worked.\nWe spotted a senior official at the Department of Defense walking through the Women\u2019s March, beginning on the National Mall and moving past the Smithsonian National Museum of American History that afternoon. His wife was also on the mall that day, something we discovered after tracking him to his home in Virginia. Her phone was also beaming out location data, along with the phones of several neighbors.\nThe official\u2019s data trail also led to a high school, homes of friends, a visit to Joint Base Andrews, workdays spent in the Pentagon and a ceremony at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall with President Barack Obama in 2017 (nearly a dozen more phones were tracked there, too).\nInauguration Day weekend was marked by other protests \u2014 and riots. Hundreds of protesters, some in black hoods and masks, gathered north of the National Mall that Friday, eventually setting fire to a limousine near Franklin Square. The data documented those rioters, too. Filtering the data to that precise time and location led us to the doorsteps of some who were there. Police were present as well, many with faces obscured by riot gear. The data led us to the homes of at least two police officers who had been at the scene.\nAs revealing as our searches of Washington were, we were relying on just one slice of data, sourced from one company, focused on one city, covering less than one year. Location data companies collect orders of magnitude more information every day than the totality of what Times Opinion received.\nData firms also typically draw on other sources of information that we didn\u2019t use. We lacked the mobile advertising IDs or other identifiers that advertisers often combine with demographic information like home ZIP codes, age, gender, even phone numbers and emails to create detailed audience profiles used in targeted advertising. When datasets are combined, privacy risks can be amplified. Whatever protections existed in the location dataset can crumble with the addition of only one or two other sources.\nThere are dozens of companies profiting off such data daily across the world \u2014 by collecting it directly from smartphones, creating new technology to better capture the data or creating audience profiles for targeted advertising.\nThe full collection of companies can feel dizzying, as it\u2019s constantly changing and seems impossible to pin down. Many use technical and nuanced language that may be confusing to average smartphone users.\nWhile many of them have been involved in the business of tracking us for years, the companies themselves are unfamiliar to most Americans. (Companies can work with data derived from GPS sensors, Bluetooth beacons and other sources. Not all companies in the location data business collect, buy, sell or work with granular location data.)\nA Selection of Companies Working\nthe Location Data Business\nA Selection of Companies Working\nin the Location Data Business\nLocation data companies generally downplay the risks of collecting such revealing information at scale. Many also say they\u2019re not very concerned about potential regulation or software updates that could make it more difficult to collect location data.\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t really keep us up at night,\u201d Brian Czarny, chief marketing officer at Factual, one such company, said. He added that Factual does not resell detailed data like the information we reviewed. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like anybody should be doing that because it\u2019s a risk to the whole business,\u201d he said.\nIn absence of a federal privacy law, the industry has largely relied on self-regulation. Several industry groups offer ethical guidelines meant to govern it. Factual joined the Mobile Marketing Association, along with many other data location and marketing companies, in drafting a pledge intended to improve its self-regulation. The pledge is slated to be released next year.\nStates are starting to respond with their own laws. The California Consumer Protection Act goes into effect next year and adds new protections for residents there, like allowing them to ask companies to delete their data or prevent its sale. But aside from a few new requirements, the law could leave the industry largely unencumbered.\n\u201cIf a private company is legally collecting location data, they\u2019re free to spread it or share it however they want,\u201d said Calli Schroeder, a lawyer for the privacy and data protection company VeraSafe.\nThe companies are required to disclose very little about their data collection. By law, companies need only describe their practices in their privacy policies, which tend to be dense legal documents that few people read and even fewer can truly understand.\nEVERYTHING CAN BE HACKED\nDoes it really matter that your information isn\u2019t actually anonymous? Location data companies argue that your data is safe \u2014 that it poses no real risk because it\u2019s stored on guarded servers. This assurance has been undermined by the parade of publicly reported data breaches \u2014 to say nothing of breaches that don\u2019t make headlines. In truth, sensitive information can be easily transferred or leaked, as evidenced by this very story.\nWe\u2019re constantly shedding data, for example, by surfing the internet or making credit card purchases. But location data is different. Our precise locations are used fleetingly in the moment for a targeted ad or notification, but then repurposed indefinitely for much more profitable ends, like tying your purchases to billboard ads you drove past on the freeway. Many apps that use your location, like weather services, work perfectly well without your precise location \u2014 but collecting your location feeds a lucrative secondary business of analyzing, licensing and transferring that information to third parties.\nFor many Americans, the only real risk they face from having their information exposed would be embarrassment or inconvenience. But for others, like survivors of abuse, the risks could be substantial. And who can say what practices or relationships any given individual might want to keep private, to withhold from friends, family, employers or the government? We found hundreds of pings in mosques and churches, abortion clinics, queer spaces and other sensitive areas.\nIn one case, we observed a change in the regular movements of a Microsoft engineer. He made a visit one Tuesday afternoon to the main Seattle campus of a Microsoft competitor, Amazon. The following month, he started a new job at Amazon. It took minutes to identify him as Ben Broili, a manager now for Amazon Prime Air, a drone delivery service.\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d Mr. Broili told us in early December. \u201cBut knowing that you all can get ahold of it and comb through and place me to see where I work and live \u2014 that\u2019s weird.\u201d That we could so easily discern that Mr. Broili was out on a job interview raises some obvious questions, like: Could the internal location surveillance of executives and employees become standard corporate practice?\nMr. Broili wasn\u2019t worried about apps cataloguing his every move, but he said he felt unsure about whether the tradeoff between the services offered by the apps and the sacrifice of privacy was worth it. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful lot of data,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I really still don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s being used. I\u2019d have to see how the other companies were weaponizing or monetizing it to make that call.\u201d\nIf this kind of location data makes it easy to keep tabs on employees, it makes it just as simple to stalk celebrities. Their private conduct \u2014 even in the dead of night, in residences and far from paparazzi \u2014 could come under even closer scrutiny.\nReporters hoping to evade other forms of surveillance by meeting in person with a source might want to rethink that practice. Every major newsroom covered by the data contained dozens of pings; we easily traced one Washington Post journalist through Arlington, Va.\nIn other cases, there were detours to hotels and late-night visits to the homes of prominent people. One person, plucked from the data in Los Angeles nearly at random, was found traveling to and from roadside motels multiple times, for visits of only a few hours each time.\nWhile these pointillist pings don\u2019t in themselves reveal a complete picture, a lot can be gleaned by examining the date, time and length of time at each point.\nLarge data companies like Foursquare \u2014 perhaps the most familiar name in the location data business \u2014 say they don\u2019t sell detailed location data like the kind reviewed for this story but rather use it to inform analysis, such as measuring whether you entered a store after seeing an ad on your mobile phone.\nBut a number of companies do sell the detailed data. Buyers are typically data brokers and advertising companies. But some of them have little to do with consumer advertising, including financial institutions, geospatial analysis companies and real estate investment firms that can process and analyze such large quantities of information. They might pay more than $1 million for a tranche of data, according to a former location data company employee who agreed to speak anonymously.\nLocation data is also collected and shared alongside a mobile advertising ID, a supposedly anonymous identifier about 30 digits long that allows advertisers and other businesses to tie activity together across apps. The ID is also used to combine location trails with other information like your name, home address, email, phone number or even an identifier tied to your Wi-Fi network.\nThe data can change hands in almost real time, so fast that your location could be transferred from your smartphone to the app\u2019s servers and exported to third parties in milliseconds. This is how, for example, you might see an ad for a new car some time after walking through a dealership.\nThat data can then be resold, copied, pirated and abused. There\u2019s no way you can ever retrieve it.\nLocation data is about far more than consumers seeing a few more relevant ads. This information provides critical intelligence for big businesses. The Weather Channel app\u2019s parent company, for example, analyzed users\u2019 location data for hedge funds, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this year that was triggered by Times reporting. And Foursquare received much attention in 2016 after using its data trove to predict that after an E. coli crisis, Chipotle\u2019s sales would drop by 30 percent in the coming months. Its same-store sales ultimately fell 29.7 percent.\nMuch of the concern over location data has focused on telecom giants like Verizon and AT&T, which have been selling location data to third parties for years. Last year, Motherboard, Vice\u2019s technology website, found that once the data was sold, it was being shared to help bounty hunters find specific cellphones in real time. The resulting scandal forced the telecom giants to pledge they would stop selling location movements to data brokers.\nYet no law prohibits them from doing so.\nLocation data is transmitted from your phone via software development kits, or S.D.Ks. as they\u2019re known in the trade. The kits are small programs that can be used to build features within an app. They make it easy for app developers to simply include location-tracking features, a useful component of services like weather apps. Because they\u2019re so useful and easy to use, S.D.K.s are embedded in thousands of apps. Facebook, Google and Amazon, for example, have extremely popular S.D.K.s that allow smaller apps to connect to bigger companies\u2019 ad platforms or help provide web traffic analytics or payment infrastructure.\nBut they could also sit on an app and collect location data while providing no real service back to the app. Location companies may pay the apps to be included \u2014 collecting valuable data that can be monetized.\n\u201cIf you have an S.D.K. that\u2019s frequently collecting location data, it is more than likely being resold across the industry,\u201d said Nick Hall, chief executive of the data marketplace company VenPath.\nTHE \u2018HOLY GRAIL\u2019 FOR MARKETERS\nIf this information is so sensitive, why is it collected in the first place?\nFor brands, following someone\u2019s precise movements is key to understanding the \u201ccustomer journey\u201d \u2014 every step of the process from seeing an ad to buying a product. It\u2019s the Holy Grail of advertising, one marketer said, the complete picture that connects all of our interests and online activity with our real-world actions.\nOnce they have the complete customer journey, companies know a lot about what we want, what we buy and what made us buy it. Other groups have begun to find ways to use it too. Political campaigns could analyze the interests and demographics of rally attendees and use that information to shape their messages to try to manipulate particular groups. Governments around the world could have a new tool to identify protestors.\nPointillist location data also has some clear benefits to society. Researchers can use the raw data to provide key insights for transportation studies and government planners. The City Council of Portland, Ore., unanimously approved a deal to study traffic and transit by monitoring millions of cellphones. Unicef announced a plan to use aggregated mobile location data to study epidemics, natural disasters and demographics.\nFor individual consumers, the value of constant tracking is less tangible. And the lack of transparency from the advertising and tech industries raises still more concerns.\nDoes a coupon app need to sell second-by-second location data to other companies to be profitable? Does that really justify allowing companies to track millions and potentially expose our private lives?\nData companies say users consent to tracking when they agree to share their location. But those consent screens rarely make clear how the data is being packaged and sold. If companies were clearer about what they were doing with the data, would anyone agree to share it?\nWhat about data collected years ago, before hacks and leaks made privacy a forefront issue? Should it still be used, or should it be deleted for good?\nIf it\u2019s possible that data stored securely today can easily be hacked, leaked or stolen, is this kind of data worth that risk?\nIs all of this surveillance and risk worth it merely so that we can be served slightly more relevant ads? Or so that hedge fund managers can get richer?\nThe companies profiting from our every move can\u2019t be expected to voluntarily limit their practices. Congress has to step in to protect Americans\u2019 needs as consumers and rights as citizens.\nUntil then, one thing is certain: We are living in the world\u2019s most advanced surveillance system. This system wasn\u2019t created deliberately. It was built through the interplay of technological advance and the profit motive. It was built to make money. The greatest trick technology companies ever played was persuading society to surveil itself.\nStuart A. Thompson (stuart.thompson@nytimes.com) is a writer and editor in the Opinion section.

I checked the clock. Three minutes had passed.\nI had just earned another 5 cents on a digital work marketplace run by Amazon called Mechanical Turk. At least I thought I had. Weeks later, I\u2019m still not sure.\nThere are lots of ways to make a little money in this world. Amazon Mechanical Turk, which since 2005 has flourished, to varying degrees, in an obscure corner of the globe-striding behemoth\u2019s empire, offers an uncertain, mystifying and often maddening way to make very, very little money.\nOn Mechanical Turk \u2014 named for a chess-playing \u201cmachine\u201d from the 18th century that concealed a living chess master \u2014 scores of thousands of humans earn pennies or dollars doing tasks that computers cannot yet easily do.\nIt works like this: Employers, known as requesters, post batches of what are called Human Intelligence Tasks, or HITs, on Mechanical Turk\u2019s website. A task could be transcribing an invoice, or taking part in a study, or labeling photographs to train an artificial intelligence program. (Occasionally a photo shows something disturbing, like a beheading.)\nFreelance workers, known informally as turkers, race to grab and do the tasks, providing what Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, once called \u201cartificial artificial intelligence.\u201d\nMost tasks pay a dime or less, and there is a daily churn of tasks that pay only a penny.\nAnd the weird thing is that workers \u2014 mostly American workers \u2014 will do them, for many different reasons.\nPeople turk to save for a motorcycle. They turk to buy insulin. They turk to pay off debt or pass the time profitably while on the clock at a boring job.\nSome do it because there are few decent-paying jobs that can be done at will. People who are confined to their homes by disability or social anxiety or who live where there are few jobs do it because, despite lousy wages, it seems like the best option.\nPlenty turk full time. In a 2016 Pew Research Center survey of nearly 3,000 American turkers, a quarter said they made most or all of their earned income on the platform. More than half the turkers surveyed said they earned under $5 an hour.\nTry Your Hand at Turking\nThroughout this story we\u2019ll give you the chance to do HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks) that The Times has devised based on ones that novice workers like me encounter on Mechanical Turk.

Please note: You will not actually be paid.\nRequesterWestern Manhattan School of Business TitleReview a Crowdfunding Project Reward$0.01 Action\nAs little as turking appears to pay on paper, in practice it often pays less because MTurk, as it is known, is a sloppy, shoddy free-for-all.\nTurkers spend their time fighting requesters over an unfair 10-cent rejection or a missing 60-cent payment. They waste minutes filling out bubbles on defective questionnaires that cannot be submitted. They abandon \u201c10-minute\u201d surveys after half an hour.\nThey swap horror stories and warnings on turker message boards (\u201crejection on a $0.50 hit,\u201d read one recent bulletin, \u201creason is \u2018funds were not allocated\u2019\u201d). They leave scathing reviews on the turker-run site Turkopticon (\u201cunfair and wild use of the rejection button\u201d).\nJust how much turkers make is the subject of considerable scholarly debate, but one paper published last year analyzed millions of tasks done by thousands of turkers. Though they probably overrepresented novice turkers like me who do the lowest-paying tasks, the paper\u2019s authors concluded that if you count time spent looking for tasks and working on tasks that came to nothing, the median turker\u2019s hourly wage was $1.77.\nOnly 4 percent of turkers, the researchers found, made more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour.\nAdvertisement\nPresiding over this production is the world\u2019s biggest tech company, feet firmly planted on the sidelines. Amazon usually declines to get involved when turkers say requesters rip them off, even as it lets requesters hide behind aliases that can make them impossible to track down.\nIt has ignored turkers\u2019 pleas to mandate higher wages, even as it takes a cut of each transaction ranging from 17 to 50 percent; a requester posting a 1-cent HIT pays one penny to the turker and another to Amazon.\nAmazon even finds ways to recoup some of the pennies turkers earn, a reminder of the days when miners were paid in scrip redeemable only at the company store. While American turkers can get their wages direct-deposited, thousands of turkers overseas have only one way to get paid without incurring third-party fees: on an Amazon gift card.\nWhile Amazon pays all of its American employees at least $15 an hour and favors raising the minimum wage, the company declined numerous requests to comment about the pay policy for turkers or anything else regarding Mechanical Turk. Minimum-wage laws generally do not apply to piecework jobs like turking.\nMechanical Turk is now one of a handful of big players in the field known as crowdwork or microwork. (One crowdwork company, Prolific, used by academic researchers, enforces a minimum wage: $6.50 an hour.)\nCrowdwork\u2019s proponents see a gleaming future \u2014 a borderless, no-overhead labor market where task-creator and task-doer meet at the intersection of supply and demand. Its critics see a throwback to something more Dickensian, where the lack of regulation and accountability keeps workers in the dark and on the defensive.\nMechanical Turk, in particular, combines the inconsistency and precariousness of gig work with Big Tech\u2019s tendency to dodge liability for the icky things that happen on its platforms.\n\u201cThis is a great little microcosm of what happens when you take away any rules and the wages fall to the bottom,\u201d said Kristy Milland, a former turker turned labor activist who was one of the authors of the paper that analyzed turkers\u2019 earnings.\nRequesterTrevor TitleTemplate Tagging Reward$0.03 Action\nThe bottom was where I dwelled during my brief tenure as a turker.\nI tagged blurry, surveillance-looking photos of construction workers on job sites according to whether they were wearing hard hats or harnesses (1 cent per photo).\nI helped train a virtual paralegal by describing a hypothetical injury claim (\u201cI suffered a serious injury because a defect in my lawn mower caused it to start\u201d) but earned nothing because the \u201csubmit\u201d box never popped up.\nI imagined myself as an \u201cactive investor\u201d and rated the prospect of my supporting a Kickstarter for a device that makes nut milk \u201cextremely likely.\u201d\nOver the course of several weeks in September, I completed 221 HITs in a little over eight hours of dedicated turking, and earned a grand total of $7.83. That works out to 97 cents an hour.\nBut hourly wages are not everything. Jane Lamont, a 30-year-old call center worker in Louisville, quit her $7.25-an-hour second job at McDonald\u2019s to turk.\nShe works from 7 to 11 on weeknights, five or six hours a day on weekends, and typically makes $5 a day.\nWhile the pay is \u201creally low,\u201d she said, she prefers turking to fast food for its freedom \u2014 freedom from having to wear a uniform, freedom to spend time at home with her mother, freedom to watch videos between tasks.\nBesides, she said, she would probably be online anyway \u2014 \u201cI like being paid while just being leisurely.\u201d On weekends, she brings her laptop to her boyfriend\u2019s house. While he\u2019s wasting time gaming, she\u2019s making money.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Ms. Lamont said. \u201cI feel like that money I can spend on extra things that I want,\u201d like two trips to New York City last year.\nKatie Boehm of Pittsburgh turned to turking in 2017 after her husband, who has diabetes, lost his job and insurance coverage. Her own health issues keep her from working outside the house, and turking seemed like a lifeline.\nShe turks at least 50 hours a week, sets herself a minimum goal of $20 a day and usually makes $30 to $50.\nHer husband\u2019s insulin costs $1,500 a month. \u201cMTurk covers about half of what he needs to survive,\u201d Ms. Boehm, 40, said. \u201cSilly insulin.\u201d\nRequesterData Capture, Inc. TitleExtract purchased items from a shopping receipt Reward$0.04 Action\nAmazon claims a turking work force of half a million, but independent researchers say the number of active turkers is smaller. An N.Y.U. data scientist who studies Mechanical Turk, Panos Ipeirotis, estimates that there are from 100,000 to 200,000 turkers, and that at any moment several thousand are doing tasks. The vast majority of turkers are believed to be in the United States \u2014 at least three-quarters, researchers say \u2014 with India a distant second.\nMechanical Turk was created to solve an in-house problem. In 2001, looking for help weeding out duplicate product listings, Amazon applied for a patent for \u201ca hybrid machine/human computing arrangement which advantageously involves humans to assist a computer to solve particular tasks.\u201d\nThe name was a homage to a contraption built by a Hungarian nobleman, featuring a bearded mannequin in a turban, that dazzled Europe with its chess-playing expertise. The moves were actually executed by a magnet-wielding human hidden beneath the board.\nMechanical Turk opened to the public in 2005 with considerable fanfare. \u201cMarket forces will define how effective it is for requesters and how lucrative it is for workers,\u201d an Amazon executive, Peter Cohen, said at the time.\nOne requester I talked to has found MTurk quite effective. For a year, Ryan Schefke, the founder of a Texas company called Lead Liaison, has used turkers to transcribe business cards that salespeople collect at events. The contacts go into a database of sales prospects, a process known as \u201clead capture.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nMultiple turkers transcribe the cards to yield 99 percent accuracy, and the turnaround from the moment a customer scans a card is 10 to 12 minutes, Mr. Schefke said. A turker is paid 3 cents per card.\n\u201cBasically it\u2019s set it and forget it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome.\u201d\nI mentioned that the one Lead Liaison task I did, transcribing a card covered in handwriting, took me 84 seconds, yielding an effective hourly wage of $1.29, and asked whether that was an issue for him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it would be relevant to us as a business,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pay is per task, not hourly, and if a turker did one card and then went off to pick cotton in the field, that\u2019s up to them. I actually think that\u2019s pretty good wages. If you look at people in the Philippines or some other countries, it\u2019s pretty good pay.\u201d The minimum wage in Metro Manila is $1.17.\nMany major corporations have availed themselves of Mechanical Turk. The New York Times Company has used turkers for at least three data projects.\nMTurk also has big fans in the social sciences. Over 50,000 academic studies are conducted using MTurk each year, according to Leib Litman, a founder of CloudResearch, a company that helps researchers use the platform.\nTurking is not always low-paying. The most proficient turkers make upward of $12 an hour, using computer scripts and free tools like HIT Catcher and HIT Forker to beat their fellow turkers to the sweetest HITs and racking up special qualifications that open the door to higher pay.\nDr. Litman said that a small cadre of super-turkers actually do most of the tasks on MTurk and estimated that the average wage for turkers who take part in studies run with CloudResearch at $6.50 an hour.\nAmber Smoot is good at turking. She sits on the porch of her future in-laws\u2019 house in Middleburg, Fla., and runs HIT Forker in the background while she watches her dogs play.\nWhen the script catches a task that pays a dollar or more, her computer blasts a snippet of operatic rock and she grabs the HIT and sets it aside until she has a bunch. \u201cI\u2019ll queue \u2019em up and kick \u2019em all out,\u201d she said.\nMs. Smoot, 32, doesn\u2019t depend on MTurk to survive, but she knows that many people do. She spends a lot of time on message boards that offer tips to rookies.\n\u201cI love MTurk and I love the opportunities it gives people \u2014 it\u2019s great for what it is, a side gig,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the state of America is that people are turning to something that shouldn\u2019t be a job and trying to make a living off it.\u201d\nMost turkers are relatively young \u2014 the majority who answered the Pew survey were under 32 years old \u2014 but some are older.\nJeff Archacki of Corvallis, Ore., is 60 and a former I.T. worker and computer store owner. Since 2014, he has gotten by on disability payments for a hand injury, and turking.\nHe sits at the computer from 2 a.m. to noon, doing crossword puzzles while waiting for good HITs, and typically makes around $40 a day. \u201cI don\u2019t live a lavish lifestyle,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to the food bank or anything.\u201d\nMs. Milland, the turker advocate, said the biggest problem on MTurk was that requesters could decline to pay turkers by \u201crejecting\u201d their submissions, but still keep the work. \u201cI\u2019ve known a requester to be open about the fact that they automatically reject 10 percent of jobs to pay for Amazon fees,\u201d she said.\nTurkers have little recourse in dealing with shady requesters.\nOften, they have no idea for whom they\u2019re working. Many requesters operate under generic, untraceable names like \u201cEvents\u201d or \u201cPanel\u201d or \u201cDavid\u201d or \u201cJosh.\u201d\nThe task where I rated the patriotic quotients of photographs was posted by an outfit called Vision. I graded eight sets for Vision. At 5 cents per set, I should have made 40 cents. But Vision shortchanged me 15 cents.\nI clicked \u201cContact Requester\u201d and asked Vision to email me, twice. I never heard back.\nAdvertisement\nWhat was I to do? According to a Mechanical Turk help page, it wasn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s problem. \u201cIf you have questions about the instructions in a particular HIT, completing a HIT, or why your HIT was rejected, contact the requester,\u201d it says. \u201cPlease note that requesters determine when your HITs are approved.\u201d\nFor another requester, I transcribed handwritten disability findings. One contained the patient\u2019s name, describing him as \u201cfully disabled\u201d and \u201cunable to sit/stand for more than 90 minutes w/o pain.\u201d\nWhy was this presumably confidential patient information posted on Mechanical Turk, a platform open to anyone with access to an email address?\nThe requester, p9r, did not respond to my \u201cContact Requester\u201d query.\nSearching the p9r website for direct contact information, I found only the physical address of a public high school in Portland, Ore. A receptionist and a business teacher there said they knew nothing of p9r. Weeks later, p9r wrote back, but when I said I was a reporter, I was ghosted again.\n(Amazon has made one recent effort toward transparency. Since July, it has listed requesters\u2019 approval rates \u2014 valuable information for a turker who is deciding whether to do a task.)\nRequesterLiz TitleConsumer attitude toward video advertising Reward$0.05 Action\nAnother occupational hazard of turking is HITs that contain graphic imagery. A few years ago, Ms. Milland did some work describing photos circulated by the Islamic State.\n\u201cYou have to digest the content of the image in order to come up with the keywords,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThings like \u2018orange jumpsuit,\u2019 \u2018caged prisoner,\u2019 \u2018prisoner on fire,\u2019 \u2018kneeling on explosives,\u2019 \u2018basket full of heads.\u2019\u201d\nThe job paid 10 cents a photo.\nA few months ago, a turker who uses the screen name sprinkles123 did a HIT for a legal-services company that uses turkers as mock jurors. It involved a car-crash victim with multiple amputations and severe burns.\n\u201cThe case had a lot of pictures and I didn\u2019t even finish the HIT,\u201d sprinkles123 said in a direct message. \u201cI still think about it and wish I hadn\u2019t opened it.\u201d Such HITs are rare and usually come with warnings, and a turker always has the option not to complete a HIT, but turkers tend to finish what they start.\nProfessor Ipeirotis of N.Y.U. said his research indicated that Amazon itself was one of the biggest requesters and that it posted tasks under many different aliases. Amazon refused to say whether it posts tasks on Mechanical Turk.\nOn the $200 billion Amazon scale of things, Mechanical Turk is a tiny operation. Still, Professor Ipeirotis said he believed that more than $100 million worth of tasks were done on Mechanical Turk annually, of which Amazon\u2019s take would be tens of millions.\nTurking can be deadly tedious one minute, deliriously random the next. Recently on a Reddit forum, a turker named Mohammed Talukder posted something like a prose poem about the turking life:\nI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m doing it I think MTurk is making me crazy following dots with my eyes ..looking at kids starving.. asking me about hotel stays..telling me to bring up past experiences of trauma \u2026 judging faces so so so many faces \u2026 watching video clips about people stealing \u2026 judging the calories for foods..is this a cat or a dog?\nMy last tasks for Mechanical Turk consisted of looking at old paintings and coming up with 10 descriptors for each one: \u201cportrait,\u201d \u201cwoman,\u201d \u201clong hair,\u201d \u201carchway.\u201d The job paid 1 cent per painting.\nThe requester was an Austrian print dealer, Meisterdrucke, that posts tens of thousands of artworks. I told Meisterdrucke\u2019s chief operating officer, Georg Petritsch, that it had taken me nine minutes and 15 seconds to do 10 of his HITs, for an hourly rate of 65 cents, and asked how he felt about paying people so little.\n\u201cIt would be a lie to say that we find it fair,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut just yesterday, I saw a documentary about the \u2018garbage island\u2019 on the Maldives, where people work in burning garbage, risking their health and lives, and get $200 a month.

Auden\u2019s \u201cSeptember 1, 1939\u201d (\u201cWaves of anger and fear / Circulate over the bright / And darkened lands of the earth\u201d). Yeats\u2019s poem, written just after World War I, spoke of a time when \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity.\u201d Auden\u2019s poem, written in the wake of Germany\u2019s invasion of Poland, described a world lying \u201cin stupor,\u201d as democracy was threatened and \u201cthe enlightenment driven away.\u201d\nApocalypse is not yet upon our world as the 2010s draw to an end, but there are portents of disorder. The hopes nourished during the opening years of the decade \u2014 hopes that America was on a progressive path toward growing equality and freedom, hopes that technology held answers to some of our most pressing problems \u2014 have given way, with what feels like head-swiveling speed, to a dark and divisive new era. Fear and distrust are ascendant now. At home, hate-crime violence reached a 16-year high in 2018, the F.B.I. reported. Abroad, there were big geopolitical shifts. With the rise of nationalist movements and a backlash against globalization on both sides of the Atlantic, the liberal post-World War II order \u2014 based on economic integration and international institutions \u2014 began to unravel, and since 2017, the United States has not only abdicated its role as a stabilizing leader on the global stage, but is also sowing unpredictability and chaos abroad.\nA 2019 Freedom House report, which recorded global declines in political rights and civil liberties over the last 13 years, found that \u201cchallenges to American democracy are testing the stability of its constitutional system and threatening to undermine political rights and civil liberties worldwide.\u201d\nIf Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s dazzling 2015 musical \u201cHamilton,\u201d about the founders\u2019 Enlightenment vision of the United States, embodied the hopes and diversity of America during the Obama years, dystopian fables and horror-driven films and television series \u2014 including \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d (2016), a rebooted \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d (2019), \u201cJoker\u201d (2019), \u201cGet Out\u201d (2017), \u201cWatchmen\u201d (2019), \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (2017) and \u201cWestworld\u201d (2016) \u2014 spoke to the darkening mood in the second half of the decade, as drug overdose deaths in America rose to nearly half a million by the decade\u2019s end, life expectancy fell in the United States and Britain, and many of us started to realize that our data (tracking everything we viewed, bought and searched for online) was being sold and commodified, and that algorithms were shaping our lives in untold ways. In what was likely the hottest decade on record, scientists warned that climate change was swiftly approaching a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d; we learned that glaciers were melting at record speed at the top of the world; and fires ravaged California and Australia and threatened the very future of the Amazon rainforest.\nMany of these troubling developments didn\u2019t happen overnight. Even today\u2019s poisonous political partisanship has been brewing for decades \u2014 dating back at least to Newt Gingrich\u2019s insurgency \u2014 but President Trump has blown any idea of \u201cnormal\u201d to smithereens, brazenly trampling constitutional rules, America\u2019s founding ideals and virtually every norm of common decency and civil discourse.\nThe biggest casualty of the decade was trust. According to a Pew survey earlier this year, only 17 percent of Americans trust the government to do what is right \u201cmost of the time\" or \u201cjust about always.\u201d America\u2019s reputation tumbled even further on the world stage: A 2018 Pew survey of 25 countries found that 70 percent of respondents said they lack confidence that the American president would make the right foreign policy moves. Between the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term and late 2018, positive views of America fell 27 percentage points in Germany, 26 points in Canada, and 25 points in France. As with many things, Donald Trump is both a symptom and a radical accelerant of the decline in trust. While exploiting the anger at the establishment that snowballed around the world in response to the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Trump has also cruelly amplified existing divisions and resentments in America, fueling suspicion of immigrants and minorities and injecting white nationalist views into the mainstream, in efforts to gin up his base.\nMr. Trump\u2019s improbable rise benefited from a perfect storm of larger economic, social and demographic changes, and the profoundly disruptive effects of new technology. His ascent also coincided with the rising anxieties and sense of dislocation produced by such tectonic shifts. Around the world, liberal democracy is facing grave new challenges, authoritarianism is on the rise and science is being questioned by \u201cpost-fact\u201d politicians. Echoes of Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist populism can be found in Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain\u2019s recent electoral victory and the Brexit referendum of 2016, and in the ascent of the far-right President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil. Democracy is under threat in Hungary and Poland. Once fringe right-wing parties with openly racist agendas are rebranding themselves in Sweden and Belgium. And far-right groups in Germany and Spain are now the third-largest parties in those nations\u2019 parliaments.\nAt the same time, Donald Trump remains a uniquely American phenomenon. Although the United States was founded on the Enlightenment values of reason, liberty and progress, there has long been another strain of thinking at work beneath the surface \u2014 what Philip Roth called \u201cthe indigenous American berserk,\u201d and the historian Richard Hofstadter famously described as \u201cthe paranoid style.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an outlook characterized by a sense of \u201cheated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy,\u201d Hofstadter wrote in his 1964 essay, and focused on perceived threats to \u201ca nation, a culture, a way of life.\u201d Its language is apocalyptic (Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d is a perfect example); its point of view, extremist. It regards its opponents as evil and ubiquitous, while portraying itself, in Hofstadter\u2019s words, as \u201cmanning the barricades of civilization.\u201d\nThe \u201cparanoid style,\u201d Hofstadter observed, tends to occur in \u201cepisodic waves.\u201d The modern right wing, he wrote, feels dispossessed: \u201cAmerica has been largely taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it.\u201d In their view, \u201cthe old American virtues have already been eaten away by cosmopolitans and intellectuals,\u201d and national independence has been \u201cdestroyed by treasonous plots, having as their most powerful agents not merely outsiders and foreigners but major statesmen seated at the very centers of American power.\u201d\nOne well-known eruption of the \u201cparanoid style\u201d occurred in the 1950s with the anti-Communist hysteria led by Joseph McCarthy. It would surface again in the 1960s with the emergence on the national stage of George C. Wallace, who ran a presidential campaign fueled by racism and white working-class rage.\nIn his 2018 book \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d the historian Jon Meacham also wrote about the cycles of hope and fear in American history, emphasizing the role that presidents play in setting a tone for the country and defining \u2014 or undermining \u2014 its founding ideals. He wrote about presidents who have worked to unify the country and appeal to what Abraham Lincoln called \u201cthe better angels of our nature,\u201d and those who have courted discord and division.\nLincoln was followed in office by his vice president Andrew Johnson, a champion of white supremacy who pardoned more than 7,000 Confederates and opposed the 14th Amendment. Johnson was impeached in 1868: And while he was not convicted in the Senate, the historian Brenda Wineapple argues, the House\u2019s decision to impeach him implied \u201cthe glimmering hope of a better time coming, a better government, a fairer and more just one\u201d down the road in the years to come.\nMr. Meacham notes that \u201cextremism, racism, nativism, and isolationism, driven by fear of the unknown, tend to spike in periods of economic and social stress.\u201d Periods, that is, like our own, when change of every sort is blowing across the globe.\nThe event that turned people\u2019s sense of dislocation and disillusionment into populist anger on both the right (the Tea Party) and the left (Occupy Wall Street and, later, Bernie Sanders\u2019s candidacy) was the 2008 financial crisis. Trust in government had been in sharp decline in previous decades \u2014 driven by Watergate and Vietnam in the 1970s, and more recently by the invasion of Iraq and the failure to find weapons of mass destruction there, and by frustration with worsening partisan gridlock in Washington. But the lingering fallout of the 2008 crash \u2014 growing income inequality, declining social mobility and dwindling job security \u2014 ignited rage against the elites and the status quo.\nWhile the banks were bailed out and the fortunate 1 percent soon made back its losses (and more), working- and middle-class voters struggled to make up lost ground. Many students realized they were looking at jobs in the gig economy and years of crippling debt, while workers in the manufacturing sector found themselves downsized or out of work. As a candidate, Mr. Trump sold himself as the champion of such voters \u2014 whom he called \u201cthe forgotten men and women\u201d \u2014 and he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington. But once in office, he enlarged the swamp, hiring some 281 lobbyists, and set about cutting taxes for corporations and the very rich.\nHe also began a war on the institutions that were the very pillars of the government he now headed. In early 2017, Mr. Trump\u2019s then adviser and strategist Steve Bannon vowed that the administration would wage a tireless battle for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d and the administration has done so ever since \u2014 nihilistically trying to undermine public faith in the efficacy, the professionalism, even the mission of the institutions that are crucial for guarding our national security, negotiating with foreign governments and ensuring the safety of our environment and workplaces. Mr. Trump also launched chilling attacks on those he reviled \u2014 from the F.B.I. to the judiciary \u2014 for having failed to put loyalty to him ahead of loyalty to the Constitution.\nThis is familiar behavior among authoritarians and would-be dictators, who resent constitutional checks and balances, and who want to make themselves the sole arbiters of truth and reality. A reporter said that in 2016 when she asked Mr. Trump why he continually assailed the press, he replied: \u201cI do it to discredit you all and demean you all so when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.\u201d It was fitting, then, that in January 2017, the month of his inauguration, George Orwell\u2019s classic novel \u201c1984\u201d shot to the top of best-seller lists. The nearly 70-year-old novel suddenly felt unbearably timely with its depiction of a world in which the truth is whatever Big Brother says it is.\nOne of the terrible ironies of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency is that his administration\u2019s dysfunction \u2014 little to no policymaking process on many issues, impulsive decision-making, contempt for expertise and plunging morale at beleaguered agencies \u2014 creates a toxic feedback loop that further undermines public trust in the government and lends momentum to his desire to eviscerate the \u201cdeep state.\u201d The conflicts of interest that swirl around Mr. Trump and his cronies further increase the public\u2019s perception of corruption and unfairness.\nMeanwhile, tectonic shifts were occurring in technology: Not just game-changing developments in artificial intelligence, genetic research and space exploration, but also new platforms, apps and gadgets that almost immediately altered people\u2019s daily habits, including Instagram (2010), Snapchat (2011), the iPad (2010), Uber (2009), and digital assistants Siri (2011) and Alexa (2014). In these years, we also developed a growing appreciation of technology\u2019s dark side: Gamergate, N.S.A. surveillance, Russian attacks on our elections, the fear that you might not only lose your job to a stranger on the other side of the planet, but also to robots in your hometown.\nIn the 2010s, we also became addicted to podcasts, and binge-watching became a thing. In fact, immersion or escape into compelling fictional worlds seemed to be one strategy people were embracing to cope with political outrage fatigue. Perhaps this also explains why nostalgia became so popular in the 2010s with reboots and returns of old television shows like \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d \u201cDynasty,\u201d \u201cLost in Space,\u201d \u201cRoseanne,\u201d \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon that\u2019s both a reflection of the retro-mania catalyzed by the endless availability of old content on the web and a longing for older, saner times.\nWith his calls to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump appealed to a different sort of nostalgia \u2014 for an era when white men were in charge and women, African Americans, Hispanics and immigrants knew their place.\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump and his campaign revived the culture wars of the 1960s and \u201970s, and politicized everything from football and Starbucks coffee cups (criticized by some evangelicals for being too secular and part of the \u201cwar on Christmas\u201d) to plastic straws and windmills. It might have been funny if we were living in a satirical novel, not in the real world with a former reality TV star as president.\nIn his insightful forthcoming book, \u201cWhy We\u2019re Polarized,\u201d Ezra Klein observes that \u201cour partisan identities have merged with our racial, religious, geographic, ideological, and cultural identities.\u201d This is coming at a moment when the nation\u2019s demographics are rapidly changing \u2014 census statistics project that America will become \u201cminority white\u201d in 2045 \u2014 and putting more emphasis than ever on questions of identity. Our political identities have become so crucial to us, Mr. Klein writes, that \u201cwe will justify almost anything or anyone so long as it helps our side, and the result is a politics devoid of guardrails, standards, persuasion, or accountability.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a measure of just how partisan our politics has become that most Republicans now reflexively support Mr. Trump \u2014 despite broken promises, ballooning deficits, and tariffs that have hurt Americans, never mind the astonishing volume of lies he emits. Many Trump supporters inhabit a soundproofed echo chamber: A 2017 study, published in the Columbia Journalism Review, found that pro-Trump audiences got most of their information from an insulated media system, anchored around Breitbart News, that reinforced \u201cthe shared worldview of readers\u201d and shielded \u201cthem from journalism that challenged it.\u201d\nNo surprise, then, that the president\u2019s hard-core supporters stubbornly repeat the lies and conspiracy theories that cycle through his Twitter feed, connecting him with Russian trolls, white nationalists and random crackpots, or that Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions and fictional narratives are amplified further by Republican politicians and the right-wing media noise machine.\nSocial media, which came into its own in the 2010s, accelerated the filter bubble effect further, as algorithms designed to maximize user \u201cengagement\u201d (and therefore maximize ad revenues) fed people customized data and ads that tended to reinforce their existing beliefs and interests. This is why Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, increasingly have trouble even agreeing upon shared facts \u2014 a development that has undermined trust between different groups, fueled incivility and sped up the niche-ification of culture that began years ago with the advent of cable television and the internet.\nIn addition, platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have enabled politicians (as well as advertisers, Russian agents and alt-right conspiracy theorists) to circumvent gatekeepers like the mainstream media and reach out directly to voters. \u201cInfluencers\u201d replaced experts, scientists and scholars; memes and misinformation started to displace facts. As the news cycle spun faster and faster, our brains struggled to cope with the flood of data and distraction that endlessly spilled from our phones. And in an era of data overload and short attention spans, it\u2019s not the most reliable, trustworthy material that goes viral \u2014 it\u2019s the loudest voices, the angriest, most outrageous posts that get clicked and shared.\nWithout reliable information, citizens cannot make informed decisions about the issues of the day, and we cannot hold politicians to account. Without commonly agreed upon facts, we cannot have reasoned debates with other voters and instead become susceptible to the fear-mongering of demagogues. When politicians constantly lie, overwhelming and exhausting us while insinuating that everyone is dishonest and corrupt, the danger is that we grow so weary and cynical that we withdraw from civic engagement. And if we fail to engage in the political process \u2014 or reflexively support the individual from \u201cour\u201d party while reflexively dismissing the views of others \u2014 then we are abdicating common sense and our responsibility as citizens.\nIn his wise and astonishingly prescient \u201cFarewell Address,\u201d from 1796, George Washington spoke of the dangers he saw the young new nation facing in the future. He warned against \u201cthe insidious wiles of foreign influence,\u201d \u201cthe impostures of pretended patriotism,\u201d and, most insistently, of \u201cthe baneful effects of the spirit of party\u201d \u2014 imploring his fellow citizens not to let partisan or geographic differences plant seeds of mistrust among those who \u201cought to be bound together by fraternal affection.\u201d\nEvery portion of the country, he wrote, should remember: \u201cYou have in a common cause fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint counsels, and joint efforts of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\u201d Citizens, he urged, must indignantly frown \u201cupon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.\u201d\nMichiko Kakutani (@michikokakutani) is the author of \u201cThe Death of Truth: Notes on Falsehood in the Age of Trump.\u201d\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Where Mr. Yang differs \u2014 beyond his almost complete lack of government or political experience \u2014 is in his prescriptions, including his signature Freedom Dividend.\nMr. Yang previously ran a successful test prep company and created the nonprofit Venture for America, which he argues is a strength, offering him fresh perspective and critical distance from the workings of Washington.\nIn an interview on Dec. 4, it was clear that Mr. Yang has done his homework, traveling across the country and listening closely. \u201cHe really seemed to have an almost emotional sense of what people have been going through and what the problems are,\u201d a board member [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] said afterward. \u201cHis portrait of the fundamental economic problems were more moving than Bernie\u2019s, and Bernie has been selling this for 30 years.\u201d\nHe articulated a vision for the future of work, education and technology for the nation. The board also delved into Mr. Yang\u2019s approach to foreign policy and military intervention, and learned of his fascination with aliens and fear of flying vacuum cleaners.\nHere is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 90-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d The Times\u2019s TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about \u201cThe Choice\u201d, or meet the editorial board members]\nKathleen Kingsbury: Wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So I have a serious question to ask you, but first we wanted to ask, were you wearing a helmet while you were biking here?\nMr. Yang biked to the Times from his Manhattan home. More New York City cyclists died biking in 2019 than in any other year since 2000; Gothamist counts 29 deaths.\nI was wearing a helmet. I have a staffer with the helmet as proof.\nJesse Wegman: Is the inside of the helmet warm?\nMy team then had me take the helmet off and then tried to make my hair look good. So that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t show up with the helmet.\nKK: It looks sharp.\nI commented to one of my team members, I feel like running for president is at least a glimpse into what it\u2019s like to be a professional woman because I feel like I care about my appearance more now than I ever did. And there are people that are always like looking after \u2014\u2014\nHe\u2019s right, of course. Women in politics have long been subjected to much closer scrutiny than men; in 1917, the first female member of Congress, Jeannette Rankin, took office and The Washington Post ran an article headlined: \u201cCongresswoman Rankin Real Girl; Likes Nice Gowns and Tidy Hair.\u201d\nBrent Staples: Scrutinizing you.\nScrutinizing, looking after it, because I\u2019m just like, \u201cWhat? My hair? Who cares? No one.\u201d And then people are like, \u201cNo, no,\u201d and they have to put time in, smooth it out.\nKK: So let\u2019s get into it. We have about 90 minutes together. In your assessment, what are the policy breakdowns that lead to Americans still being hungry today?\nWow, I love this question. There are many causes of poverty, and the fact that we\u2019re not able to put food into people\u2019s houses and on their tables is a structural problem. My campaign\u2019s based upon the premise that we\u2019re going through this profound economic transformation, the fourth industrial revolution. And one of the major problems is that we still pretend we\u2019re in the economy of the \u201970s or \u201980s.\nMr. Yang is not the first to label this period \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2014 the term was made popular by Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, at its annual meeting in Davos in 2016. Mr. Schwab\u2019s book of the same name argues that \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d is transforming every sector of the economy and industry through new technologies that merge the physical, digital and biological realms.\nIn the \u201970s or \u201980s, your labor and overall productivity were more or less in lock step. And we still pretend that if someone wakes up in the morning and says, \u201cHey, I need to put food on the table,\u201d he can go out to his main street, he can sell his time for money at some hourly rate, and then he\u2019ll be able to make a good enough living so he can feed his family, raise kids and the rest of it. That has become progressively less true over the last 40 years, unfortunately, where wages have stagnated while productivity has gone up and up, and that\u2019s going to accelerate because of the convergence of capital and technology now, in unprecedented ways.\nStarting in 1979, productivity and pay sharply diverged \u2014 productivity rose nearly 70 percent, while typical hourly pay essentially stagnated, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\nEspecially for people who are at the lower end of the skills ladder, which is most Americans. Only 33 percent of Americans will graduate from college, 42 percent if you include two-year degrees.\nSo you\u2019re looking at a nation of high school graduates. And what do high school graduates do for a living? The top five occupational categories are retail and administrative, which includes call center work, retail, food service and food preparation, transportation, primarily truck driving, and attendant supportive jobs and manufacturing still. We all know that we have gutted many of these industries, and their labor bases have shrunk.\nSo for a high school graduate in America to get by, if you have one health problem or car breakdown, it can take a very tenuous financial situation and send it in a downward spiral. Then how do you put food on the table? In theory, there are nonprofits and food pantries that would see to this, but we all know that they\u2019re dramatically underresourced relative to the need. And so when you look at the causes of food poverty, to me the best solution is instead of trying to create organizations that will put food into people\u2019s hands, which we should do obviously, we should just put money into Americans\u2019 hands and then they would be able to procure food to provide for themselves and their families.\nMr. Yang\u2019s candidacy has centered on the idea of his Freedom Dividend, essentially universal basic income \u2014 which has a long history, drawing support from Thomas Paine, Martin Luther King Jr. and Friedrich von Hayek, but also a controversial one. (Later annotations will look at why.)\nKK: So I assume you\u2019re referring to [your] universal basic income plan. Your campaign platform, you have tons and tons of proposals, everything from U.B.I. to universal daylight saving time. Plans don\u2019t really mean anything unless you have priorities. What would you do immediately when you enter office? What would be first on your agenda? What would you want to accomplish in the first 100 days?\nMr. Yang has prided himself on injecting the race with new thinking through proposals like yearlong daylight saving time. Daylight saving time was instituted during World War I for energy-efficiency purposes. Mr. Yang argues that extending it year-round would decrease traffic accidents, increase economic activity and lower crime.\nTo me, the economic imbalances are causing many of our other problems. If you look up and down the line, health problems, poor educational attainment and results, even political polarization, they stem from the fact that we have this pervasive financial insecurity where 78 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost half can\u2019t afford an unexpected $400 or $500 bill. If you can\u2019t pay next month\u2019s rent, it\u2019s very hard to worry about climate change. I come and talk to you and say, \u201cHey, we need to fight climate change.\u201d And you look up and say like, \u201cI\u2019m worried about next month. Next year, next decade has to wait in line.\u201d\nThe statistic that 78 percent of Americans live paycheck to paycheck was reported in a 2017 study by the human capital management firm CareerBuilder. Read the study here.\nAnd that\u2019s probably a generous response. Some of the responses would be worse than that. So if you get the boot off people\u2019s throats, then you can start making progress on our health, on our educational outcomes, on our political polarization.\nEveryone knows my flagship proposal is this Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult, which is not a new idea. And it\u2019s not my idea. Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country. Martin Luther King fought for it and was fighting for it when he was assassinated. So after I\u2019m the nominee and I defeat Donald Trump, everyone will know that I\u2019m in the White House because of the Freedom Dividend.\nDemocrats and progressives will be so thrilled to have defeated Donald Trump, they will love the fact that we\u2019re going to put buying power into families\u2019 hands, make children stronger and healthier. But here\u2019s the great thing: The Republicans will look up and say, \u201cWait a minute, do I hate the Freedom Dividend?\u201d And they look up, and they notice only one state\u2019s had a dividend for almost 40 years, and it\u2019s Alaska, a deep red conservative state, that was passed by a Republican governor.\nSince 1982, Alaska has been giving every resident an annual check from its $66.3 billion permanent fund, which gets at least 25 percent of the state\u2019s mineral royalties every year. The results of the experiment have been mixed \u2014 crippling poverty is low, but unemployment rates are among the highest in the country, and the fund\u2019s value fluctuates with oil prices.\nThe reason I am drawing, in some polls, 10 percent or more of Donald Trump voters to my campaign is that Republicans and conservatives do not hate economic buying power in citizens\u2019 hands. What they hate is a giant bureaucracy making everyone\u2019s decisions. So you ask what my main priority will be as president, it will be to get the Freedom Dividend across the finish line and get buying power into Americans\u2019 hands, which will then lead us to be able to solve many other problems much more quickly.\nMr. Yang\u2019s argument that he is pulling 10 percent or more of Trump supporters was not rated favorably on PolitiFact \u2014 the 10 percent figure comes from a July YouGov poll, and subsequent polls found the number to be lower.\nKK: Have you spoken to Republican lawmakers about the Freedom Dividend?\nI haven\u2019t sat down with a lot of sitting senators and congressmen and women, but I\u2019ve talked to literally thousands of people who supported Donald Trump in the last election who say they are now supporting me. I\u2019ve talked to many folks who are Republicans who say they are, at least, sympathetic to my message, in large part because they understand the numbers. When I talked to 70 C.E.O.s here in New York City, not that far from here, it was a fancy bank office, most of them were Republicans. I said, \u201cHow many of you are looking at replacing your back-office clerical workers with artificial intelligence and software?\u201d Guess how many hands went up out of 70. All of them. The truth is, you should fire any C.E.O. who was not looking to make that happen, because their incentives are all tied to the bottom-line profitability of their firm. And most of them were Republicans. So they understand the need for what I am proposing.\nJamie Dimon, who is a Democrat but is a numbers person, has looked at the numbers and said, we should declare a national emergency around the fact that the economy is not working for most Americans. And he\u2019s proposing a negative income tax, which is a close cousin to the Freedom Dividend that I\u2019m championing.\nUnlike universal basic income, a system that would provide some cash to every person regardless of income level, a negative income tax system would give cash to people below a certain income threshold. Milton Friedman made the case for the tax as a poverty alleviation tool in his 1962 book \u201cCapitalism and Freedom.\u201d\nSo this is not a left or a right idea, this is bipartisan. And many Republicans will see that this is going to be a huge win for their constituents, for rural areas, for red states on the interior. We don\u2019t need 80 percent of Congress to pass it, we just need a majority.\nKK: I want to move on to some other questions, but I actually have one last for you, which is why run as a Democratic versus a Republican if you have such bipartisan issues?\nI\u2019ve been a registered Democrat since the Clinton years; I was an Obama appointee. I had a fund-raiser for John Kerry. It wasn\u2019t a great fund-raiser because I was kind of young; it wasn\u2019t one of those fancy ones where you generate tens of thousands.\nKK: How much money did you raise?\nI want to say we raised maybe $5,000, and I was quite pleased. It was at a lounge.\nKK: With inflation, though, it would be higher, right?\nWell, thank you for saying so. Yeah, in 2019 dollars it must be at least $6,000. I\u2019ve been a Democrat for years and years, and if you look at my alignment on the vast majority of issues, they\u2019re lock step with the Democratic Party. So it was very natural for me to run as a Democrat. I\u2019ve ruled out completely any third-party bid because that would in my mind increase the chances of Donald Trump winning, and the mission is to defeat Donald Trump and help move the country forward.\nMr. Yang, a former technology executive and entrepreneur, has distinguished himself from Senator Sanders and the far left of the Democratic Party in making the case for a more humane capitalist system, what he calls \u201chuman-centered capitalism.\u201d\nKK: O.K. Moving onto a perhaps slightly less serious topic.\nIn hindsight, this was not an accurate assessment of the next question.\nI like it already.\nAisha Harris: Back in September, you actually spoke out on behalf of the comedian Shane Gillis, who had been hired on \u201cSNL\u201d and then was quickly fired after some racist comments were stirred up that he had made in the past on one of his podcasts. And you said you didn\u2019t want to be judged for something you had done 25 years ago. But Gillis\u2019s comments were maybe a year ago. So I\u2019m curious as to, in your mind, how long of a period of time should it be before someone faces some sort of consequences for something they\u2019ve done in the past?\nMr. Gillis was hired by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d last September, then dropped days later after clips surfaced showing him using slurs and language offensive toward Asian and L.G.B.T.Q. people, including one specifically about Mr. Yang. Mr. Yang later said the comedian should have had the chance to keep his job and explained: \u201cAs a society, we have become unduly punitive and vindictive about people making statements that some find offensive or distasteful.\u201d\nSo when I heard that Shane Gillis had called me \u201cJew chink\u201d \u2014 I think was the slur \u2014 my reaction was the same reaction anyone would have, which was like, who the heck is this guy, and he sounds like a total jackass. Well, my wife actually had heard about it independently and was also like, \u201cWho the heck is this guy?\u201d And so then I sat down and started to figure out who Shane Gillis was, what he did for a living, and then I sat down and watched some of his comedy to try and get some context.\nAfter watching his comedy, I felt that he wasn\u2019t a malignant racist and that his slur toward me was just very, very bad comedy run amok. Which did not strike me as a fireable offense, and I realized that if I was the individual who was actually directly slurred, and I did not feel that he should lose his job over it, then I should probably share that sentiment with other people.\nParticularly because I think we\u2019ve become unduly vindictive and punitive toward statements that people find objectionable. A friend of mine said something, he said, \u201cIf the online universe descends on someone, and they lose their job, the online universe moves on a week later, but that person still does not have a job a week later.\u201d That the impact on the individual lasts much, much longer than the rancor. So I shared this.\nThe comment about I wouldn\u2019t want to be judged for something 25 years ago was about something completely independent. I think I\u2019d seen something where Joe Biden was being called out for something he\u2019d said 25 years ago, when I said I wouldn\u2019t want to be called out for some misstatement I\u2019d made 25 years ago. And then I joked, good thing no one cared about what I was doing 25 years ago, because I was at that point a 20-year-old man, and the internet didn\u2019t really have full documentation of how I spent those years.\nMr. Yang was asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d about cancel culture and whether Americans have gone \u201ctoo far in the direction of a lack of grace or a lack of forgiveness.\u201d He responded: \u201cI\u2019m new to politics, but I certainly would hate to be judged by something I did 25 years ago.\u201d\nSo the Shane Gillis opinion was not based upon the timeline, it was just based upon my reaction as a person, and the person that was directly named. I certainly think there should be consequences for one\u2019s statements and actions, and I certainly think that obviously he made the statements within the year, and that if you did have some sort of time frame when you would want to overlook something, it would be much longer than a year.\nMr. Yang\u2019s comments, on Mr. Gillis and on judgment more broadly, contribute to a growing conversation among political and cultural figures about the merits and downsides of \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Former President Obama, for example, spoke out about the prevalence of \u201ccall-out culture\u201d during an interview in October, arguing that criticizing people on social media for not being \u201cwoke\u201d enough is \u201cnot activism\u201d and \u201cnot bringing about change.\u201d\nAH: But do you think, I mean, he never truly apologized. He just said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re offended.\u201d And while you may not have felt that way, there were other jokes he made about just Asian-Americans and Asian people in general, and there were other people who were obviously affected by this. So I mean, what kind of consequences do you think someone who makes those kinds of statements and who doesn\u2019t show any sort of remorse for it, should they face? If not firing, what should happen? What would the steps be?\nMr. Gillis issued what some saw as a non-apology, writing on Twitter that he is a comedian \u201cwho pushes boundaries\u201d and his \u201cintention is never to hurt.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said.\u201d\nWell, in this case, what\u2019s interesting is it\u2019s up to the employer, and it was NBC and \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Even as I made the statement saying I didn\u2019t think he should be fired, I thought he probably would be fired. Because if you\u2019re NBC and \u201cSNL,\u201d you look up and say, what is my upside for keeping this guy? He\u2019s not exactly a huge moneymaker, he hasn\u2019t worked a day on the set. Like, that\u2019s not a really powerful set of incentives. And so I thought they probably would fire him. I\u2019d suggest that the extent there are consequences for people\u2019s misstatements, they should be somewhere commensurate to the level of power and influence they have and the harm that they\u2019re doing. In Shane Gillis\u2019s case, he was a comedian. I\u2019d never heard of the guy before.\nAH: I mean, I don\u2019t think most people had.\nNo, certainly not before the statements had taken place, and in terms of consequences, I would suggest that someone like Shane had probably paid a price in many ways. Like, aside from being fired, there are many circles that, if he shows up in, he\u2019d be labeled very, very negatively. He reached out to me personally, and I had a conversation with him. The conversation with him made me feel more confident that I\u2019d done the right thing. Because I think in many cases we\u2019re trying to follow up on a sense of shame and humiliation that the person might already feel.\nAfter Mr. Gillis was fired, Mr. Yang tweeted that the comedian had reached out to him. \u201cLooks like we will be sitting down together soon,\u201d Mr. Yang wrote. Neither the comedian nor the candidate appears to have spoken publicly about the content of the meeting.\nKK: I think we have some questions around economics.\nBinyamin Appelbaum: Yes. After every invention basically since the plow, people have found new uses for the time saved by new technologies. You\u2019ve argued that this time, this won\u2019t happen quickly enough. Why will this time be different? What gives you the confidence that we\u2019re confronting something new in all of human history?\nMr. Yang has argued that his Freedom Dividend is one answer to the needs of the millions who will lose their jobs to automation.\nThe numbers. So keep in mind, I didn\u2019t just wake up and say, \u201cHey, technology is changing the world.\u201d I spent seven years working in Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis, Baltimore and other cities that have been blasted by the waves of automation.\nThis work was through Mr. Yang\u2019s nonprofit, Venture for America. More on that in a bit.\nDetroit is a city of 680,000 people. Its peak population was 1.7 million. If you look this direction, you can see a thriving neighborhood, and then you turn 90 degrees and you see abandoned buildings as far as the eye can see. If we were adapting, you would see not multidecade low rates of interstate migration, which we have right now. You would not be seeing 80 percent of the country have multidecade low levels of business formation, which we have right now. You would not be seeing historic lows of business formation among young people, which we have right now. You would not see labor force participation at 62.9 percent, a multidecade low which we have right now. You would not see record-high levels of drug overdoses and suicides to the point that America\u2019s life expectancy has declined for three years in a row, which we have right now.\nMr. Yang argues that the automation of manufacturing jobs \u2014 especially in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa \u2014 helped breed the discontent and economic desperation that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\nBA: But we also have record low unemployment, and when you mention labor force participation, some people think a big factor there is that the government already is giving people too much money.\nLabor force participation \u2014 the share of Americans either employed or \u201cactively looking for work\u201d \u2014 declined precipitously from the late 1990s, dropping to 62.7 percent in 2014 (its lowest rate since the Carter administration). Critics of President Obama liked to argue that this was because of government handouts. But there\u2019s a counterargument to be found in demographic trends \u2014 the Congressional Budget Office estimates that a sizable portion of the decline in labor-force participation is a result of the aging of the work force.\nWell, the labor force participation rate has declined precipitously, so I don\u2019t buy that somehow the government started giving people more money over the last number of years. And the headline unemployment rate, and I\u2019m sure you know this, it doesn\u2019t measure underemployment, 40 to 44 percent of recent college graduates are now doing a job that does not require a college degree. It does not measure the fact that 94 percent of new jobs in the economy are temp, gig or contract jobs that do not have health care benefits and can disappear at any moment. It doesn\u2019t include the fact that you might be doing two or three jobs to make ends meet.\nA 2016 study from the economists Lawrence Katz at Harvard and Alan Krueger at Princeton found that 94 percent of net job growth between 2005 and 2015 was \u201calternative work,\u201d including independent contractors, freelancers and temps.\nUber is literally advertising to schoolteachers saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019ve figured out schoolteachers make really good Uber drivers.\u201d And if you look at that situation, the headline unemployment rate says, \u201cCheck, this person is employed. Heck, this person might be employed twice.\u201d The headline unemployment rate when Donald Trump was running for president, he castigated it as fake news, and then he got into office and all the sudden it became real news. He was right the first time. The number is almost intentionally designed to obscure any of the difficulties in the labor market. If I drop out of the labor market, I no longer count. I actually help the number.\nRight now we have three flagship numbers we\u2019re beating the American people over the head with, telling them that things are going great. No. 1, the headline unemployment rate. No. 2, gross domestic product, which is obviously putting up record highs even as our life expectancy is declining. And No. 3, corporate profits and shareholder value. Stock market prices correspond to the fortunes of the top 20 percent of Americans, many of the people, obviously, who live here in Manhattan. The bottom 80 percent of Americans own 8 percent of stock market value. The bottom 50 percent own essentially zero.\nThe American cities with the highest number of high-net-worth individuals are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington. California has the most number of people on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans.\nIf these are your measurements, then of course you\u2019re going to think things are going in one direction, while your way of life disintegrates. Even the inventor of G.D.P., Simon Kuznets, said 100 years ago, this is a terrible measurement of national well-being, and we should never use it as that.\nIf you run an organization, imagine having an organization that has the wrong measurements. How is that organization going to fare over time? That is where we are in the United States of America right now. We\u2019re riding a century-old measurement off a cliff, while our way of life deteriorates underneath our feet. If you looked at levels of anxiety, stress, mental health, depression, suicides, drug overdoses, you would see that we\u2019re in a mental health recession or depression, we\u2019re in a wellness or life expectancy recession or depression, and the corporate profits are going to keep on going up, because in the 21st-century economy, companies can do very, very well while not hiring a lot of people, not treating them as full-time employees, and they don\u2019t need to care what happens in their own backyard because they sell everywhere.\nGross domestic product is a measure of a country\u2019s entire economic output. Its inventor worried that it might be mistaken as a measure of citizens\u2019 well-being. Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign has proposed that America measure its economic prosperity with a different index that accounts for human and not just monetary factors, including inequality and quality of life.\nBA: But you\u2019re not proposing to fix any of that. People don\u2019t just work to make money; they do work for a sense of self-worth. They work so that they can develop skills, they work so they have the possibility of earning more money someday. You\u2019re proposing to replace a portion of the income they may have lost, but not any of those other things. Why is that a solution?\nI love work, and the numbers also clearly show that people need work. Men in particular, without work, they volunteer less than employed men. So think about that for a second. They have higher rates of substance abuse, their health deteriorates, all these social ills accompany. Of course, we need to create jobs in as many communities as possible.\nHarmful effects of unemployment are felt by men and women, but men are more likely to experience negative health effects including depression and increased risk of suicide.\nThe question is, what is the means to creating those jobs? What I\u2019m suggesting is that if you were to put $12,000 a year into the hands of every American adult \u2026 Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a town in Missouri of 10,000 people. Let\u2019s say after I\u2019m president, their disposable income goes up by $10 million a month. Where is that money going to go? It\u2019s going to go into car repairs, day care expenses, Little League sign-ups, the occasional night out.\nIf you were a person in that town in Missouri and you wanted to start a bakery, before the dividend, it\u2019s a dumb idea. Post-dividend, it might be a great idea. You can hire someone to help staff the bakery, you know if the bakery fails, you\u2019re going to survive because you have this income that you can rely upon. This is the most stable and secure way to create jobs that actually reflect our community\u2019s needs and values. What are the other alternatives? For the government to come in and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to designate five people to clean up this park forever.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to designate 10 people to make our people stronger forever, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re \u2014\u2014\u201d\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government commissioned a series of experiments to look at how guaranteed income effects labor participation. Researchers discovered that a program like U.B.I. doesn\u2019t have the drastic effect on work that some might predict; households overall reduce their workload by roughly 13 percent, according to a paper in the Canadian Public Policy journal.\nBA: So a Republican would say that alternative is to let markets work. Is that what makes you a Democrat \u2014 you don\u2019t think the market will create enough jobs for Americans?\nOh, I think the market will work beautifully toward what it\u2019s designed to do. The market is designed for maximal capital efficiency, and it is doing a phenomenal job. That\u2019s why you see the returns on capital outstripping the returns on labor at historic levels. The market is not designed to maximize human well-being.\nAnd again, all you have to do to look at it is to say, stock market prices and G.D.P. record highs, life expectancy declining. Like, that sums it up. You know? You don\u2019t need any clearer divergence than that.\nMr. Trump likes to say that the economy has reached historic highs under his administration. However, life expectancy has been falling and other measures of well-being have declined, including rising rates of depression diagnosis.\nWhat I\u2019m suggesting is we actually make capitalism\u2019s goals align with ours, as human beings, as parents, as Americans. Instead of maximizing these capital efficiency measurements, we should be maximizing our own health and life expectancy, our children\u2019s education and success rates, our mental health and freedom from substance abuse, our environmental sustainability. Then we can line up the power of the markets with how we are doing. But the markets do not care one whit about us and our children.\nBA: I want to ask you about the \u2014 Oh, sorry, go ahead.\nKK: Oh, sorry, I just wanted to ask you, you know, there are some people who would suggest that a better use of money, instead of giving a Freedom Dividend, would be to dramatically overhaul America\u2019s high schools and start teaching people different skills instead of trying to continue the race against A.I. Why isn\u2019t that a path? Why couldn\u2019t we instead change how we do education in this country?\nThe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s Future of Education and Skills 2030 project is exploring the ways education systems internationally need to change to prepare students for a rapidly automating economy.\nWe should definitely do that, in a very big and dramatic way. And I have proposals to help move us toward a better model of high school education. Only 6 percent of American high school students are in technical, trade or apprenticeship tracks. In Germany, that\u2019s 59 percent. Think about that gulf. Meanwhile, there are millions of those trade and middle-scale jobs that are left unfilled. Why is this?\nOne, it\u2019s a lot easier and cheaper for us to throw kids into a classroom with textbooks and a teacher and say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to go to college,\u201d than it is to try and train them in skills that are going to give them a secure livelihood. Number two, we have fetishized college and stigmatized anything that\u2019s not college. We\u2019ve beaten Americans over the head, pretended everyone\u2019s going to college and say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to work for you.\u201d And the Democrats are guilty of this. That\u2019s why they\u2019re yelling, \u201cFree college, free college.\u201d Meanwhile, again, only 33 percent of Americans are going to go to college, and that is a relatively stable number.\nThe question of whether to prioritize free public college has divided the Democratic candidates. Senators Warren and Sanders say that four-year public colleges should be free, and Senator Cory Booker signed on to legislation that could make it debt-free. Senator Amy Klobuchar previously criticized the idea of \u201cfree college for all,\u201d but then signed on to a version of a free-college proposal. Mr. Yang, though, has said he supports forgiving more student loan debt but thinks the Freedom Dividend is a better solution to inequality than free college.\nKK: But access to college is still a civil rights issue in this country.\nPresident Obama referred to education as the \u201ccivil rights issue of our time,\u201d as did former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. Indeed, the gap between education outcomes for black and white students has barely budged in recent decades, according to research from the Brookings Institution.\nIt very much is. But if you were to apply resources, you would want to apply resources in ways that don\u2019t necessarily advantage the top third of your population by educational attainment exclusively. You would be trying to build more paths with the other two-thirds, which investing in trades and apprenticeships would do, and you would try and provide for the people who are the weakest and most vulnerable in the job market, which are not going to be the people that are attending college.\nMost American laborers work in the services sector, according to Pew Research \u2014 in July 2019, 107.8 million people worked in private service-providing industries including trade, transportation and utilities.\nOur economy is breaking down on all levels. Again, if you are fortunate enough to graduate from college today, you\u2019re in the top third of the population, you\u2019re graduating with tens of thousands in school loans very, very often, and there\u2019s a 40 to 44 percent chance you\u2019re going to do a job that does not require your college degree. That\u2019s if you\u2019re one of the winners in our society today. I spent seven years working with, frankly, some of the top educational products in our country. I saw that even the winners are not winning right now. And so imagine if you\u2019re a nonwinner, what this looks like.\nBS: Would you dilate what you\u2019re talking \u2014 seven years doing what?\nI started and ran a national nonprofit called Venture for America that recruited enterprising college graduates to help grow businesses in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, New Orleans, Birmingham, Baltimore, and nine other American cities. We helped create several thousand jobs. I\u2019m very, very proud of that. But I realize that the jobs we were creating were only going to apply for a small slice of the population. And these jobs were pouring water into a bathtub that has a giant hole ripped in the bottom. I\u2019m running for president to let America know that it is not our imagination, the water is rushing out of the bathtub. Immigrants have nothing to do with it. It\u2019s the fact that we\u2019re going through the greatest economic transformation.\nMr. Yang founded Venture for America, a fellowship program for recent college graduates, in 2011, with the goal of creating 100,000 new jobs in the country\u2019s most underresourced cities. As of 2019, the nonprofit has created around 3,500 jobs.\nBA: Just before we move on, maybe I can ask one more question.\nOf course, sure.\nBA: Your proposal is oddly regressive. On the benefits side you\u2019re proposing that people will have to choose between this benefit and their existing federal benefits while someone like me just all the sudden gets a new check in their mailbox every month. On the funding side you\u2019re relying on a VAT, which is an inherently regressive funding mechanism. You\u2019ve proposed some offsets, but I still don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t just embrace a progressive approach to taxation. Either raise top rates or a wealth tax. If there are people who need help, why aren\u2019t you trying to help them as much as possible?\nA VAT (value-added tax) is a tax on consumption, so the burden disproportionately falls on low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income.\nI\u2019m for a more progressive tax structure. It\u2019s clear that the people at the top of the income chain are not paying enough. I don\u2019t think a wealth tax will work. I like the spirit of a wealth tax, but if you look at other countries\u2019 experience, Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, very sophisticated developed countries, they tried a wealth tax and they wound up repealing it because it had massive compliance problems, and it did not generate anywhere near the revenue that was projected.\nSo if you cannot learn from the experiences of other countries, what can you learn from? We have to take a policy that actually works, and what those countries and every other developed country have determined works, is a value added tax. Because a value added tax is impossible to game your way out of. If you\u2019re a trillion-dollar technology company \u2014 you know, I was just in New Hampshire campaigning yesterday, and you know what I say to them? I say to everyone around the country, Amazon, a trillion-dollar technology company sucking up $20 billion in business every year, closing 30 percent of your stores and malls, paying zero in taxes, how do you feel about that? You know? And they are angry. They say, how the heck can Amazon be paying zero in taxes? And I was like, I know. And it\u2019s up to you, the people of New Hampshire, to change it. So if you look at other countries \u2014\u2014\nIn 1990, 12 European countries had some form of a wealth tax, while today only three have kept the policy \u2014 Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Reports by the O.E.C.D. and others have found that the tax led to an exodus of the wealthy and didn\u2019t raise as much revenue as anticipated.\nBA: But that doesn\u2019t make our tax code more progressive.\nSo if you look at other countries, they have a value-added tax and then they take those resources and put them to work toward various social programs in ways to balance out the inequality. Now, another thing I love about the value-added tax is you can either reduce it or exempt things like diapers, toilet paper, eggs, milk, things that Americans consume just to make ends meet, and you can dial it up on things like artificial intelligence, yachts, luxury watches. There are ways that you can make it so that it falls more heavily on people that would barely notice. And we\u2019re taking the resources plus an additional hundreds of billions of dollars and putting it directly into the hands of working Americans. This would increase the buying power of literally 90 percent of Americans.\nBA: But just to be clear, it\u2019s still not a progressive tax. There\u2019s no model that says that you can use these kinds of exclusions and exemptions to make that progressive. You can make it less regressive. You\u2019re still fundamentally proposing a nonprogressive means of revenue raising.\nA progressive tax is one in which the rate increases with income, while a regressive tax increases inversely with income.\nIn a vacuum, you\u2019re 100 percent correct. But it\u2019s failing to account for the fact that we\u2019re taking that money, and then some, and putting it directly into the hands of the American consumer.\nBA: But that just brings us to the other side of it, where what you\u2019re proposing is not to give as much more money to the people who need it the most. You\u2019re saying, if you get food stamps, the amount by which your government benefits increase will be less than for me or you.\nA working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.B.I. could redirect spending to more affluent and middle-income families, therefore leaving low-income families worse off; a U.B.I. large enough to direct more funds to low-income households would be extremely costly. Read the paper here.\nLet\u2019s say I\u2019m on food stamps, and I\u2019ve got a 15-year-old son and a 12-year-old daughter. I\u2019m concerned about their future, very, very deeply. And then Andrew Yang becomes president, and I find out that my 15-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month starting at age 18 for the rest of his life, and my 12-year-old is going to get $1,000 a month for the rest of her life. I\u2019m going to say, wow. That\u2019s actually the biggest value gain I\u2019ve ever even heard of in history. My kid will have a financial literacy class in high school, the first semester of their senior year. It is impossible to teach financial literacy to someone who does not have money. So the kids will actually learn about what to do with the money before they start getting the money.\nOther candidates have taken a different approach to creating a nest egg for low-income youth \u2014 Senator Booker, for example, favors baby bonds, which would provide every infant with a savings account that the government would contribute to annually depending on family income.\nThis is a game changer for Americans in any circumstance. And I am not for reducing or curtailing any of these social programs. For me, we\u2019re trying to lay a foundation that works for all Americans, and then we need to keep building on top of it. So if there are people that post-Freedom Dividend need additional programs and assistance, I\u2019m all for it.\nKK: I want to ask you, you were the C.E.O. of Manhattan Prep. How does test prep \u2014 doesn\u2019t that contribute to income inequality in the United States?\nMr. Yang was the C.E.O. of a boutique test prep company that was purchased by Kaplan in 2009. The company flourished during the 2008 financial collapse, becoming the country\u2019s foremost preparatory company for the GMAT as more people flocked to business school.\nYeah, it does. It\u2019s one reason why I think we need to de-emphasize \u2014 excuse me.\nKK: Take your time.\nNot at all. We originated the SAT during World War II as a way to determine which kids we did not want to send to the front lines. Now we treat our kids like every year is wartime. I\u2019ve talked to parents and teachers around the country, and I\u2019ve said, we need to de-emphasize these standardized tests. They are a terrible measurement of human value, certainly have nothing to do with character. At this point, as you said, they are more likely to test your parents\u2019 socioeconomic status than anything else.\nThe SAT was first administered in 1926 and evolved out of a test used for admission to Princeton University and Cooper Union. It was inspired by military experiments with I.Q. testing.\nSo we need to have better, more holistic ways of measuring how our kids are doing educationally, and we need to empower teachers and let teachers do their jobs. Because if you are a teacher and you\u2019re teaching to the test, you end up making decisions in the classroom that you know are not right for the students.\nKK: Actually, I also want to ask you about your time at Manhattan Prep. Your colleague Kimberly Watkins told City Council in September that she had faced both gender harassment and pay inequity under your leadership there. Could you respond to those allegations?\nI believe your reporters then talked to maybe half a dozen or more of Kim\u2019s contemporaries at the organization and found out that those allegations were completely groundless, which they were.\nIn an essay published by the Gotham Gazette, Kimberly Watkins alleged that Mr. Yang fired her from Manhattan Prep because he did not think she would \u201ccontinue working as hard\u201d after getting married. Mr. Yang appeared on \u201cThe View\u201d shortly after and said there was \u201czero truth\u201d to Ms. Watkins\u2019s account. After publication, Ms. Watkins reached out to the editorial board, noting the question contained an error \u2014 she testified before a New York City hearing on pay equity, but, as she wroteto us , \u201cI have on multiple occasions drawn contrast to \u2018pay equity,\u2019 with what I experienced, which concerns long term economic stability. The reality that my economic future was destroyed by Yang, right after my marriage, after an unblemished six-year commitment to this company, has been the focus of my story, not pay inequity\u2026Yang\u2019s response [also] grossly overstates the investigative process and draws a false conclusion.\u201d\nNick Fox: Can I clarify one point on taxation? Are you proposing any new or increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans or corporations, or is it strictly the VAT?\nIf you look at our proposals, we have a tax on financial transactions, which would obviously end up falling most heavily on the wealthiest Americans and the wealthiest companies. We have a carbon tax, which tends to fall most heavily on the wealthiest industries, which are emitting a lot. The value-added tax would obviously be enormously generative from people who benefit from society and consume the most. I\u2019m for trying to restore our income tax levels to previous levels to be more progressive.\nA Times evaluation of Mr. Yang's tax plan by N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of economics at Harvard, found that Mr. Yang\u2019s tax plan would target the affluent who spend their money lavishly while incentivizing people to save.\nMichelle Cottle: Now, I think it\u2019s clear that people are responding to you in part because you have this big vision, but Washington has a problem achieving even kind of modest \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has a fervent online following that calls itself the Yang Gang.\nYeah, we noticed.\nMC: So, and we are currently enjoying a businessmen president who has no experience in government or the military. What is your argument to people, that we should trust you with no experience in government and the military, in the same position, and that you will do a better job dealing with the peculiarities of Washington.\nMany of Mr. Yang\u2019s supporters say they are drawn to his perspective as a political outsider; in The Wall Street Journal, some say they previously supported Senator Sanders but now look for a candidate who offers an even fresher non-Washington perspective.\nWell, it sounds like you\u2019ve been there.\nMC: Quite a lot.\nDid you come up for this?\nMC: Yeah, I\u2019m based out of \u2014\u2014\nOh, man. Well, thank you for making the trip. Then you know. First, any person who says they\u2019re going to run government like a business does not know what they\u2019re talking about, because they are two completely different things.\nIn a business you can say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to go this way,\u201d and people generally have to do what you\u2019re saying. In government it\u2019s much more analogous to my role as the founder of a national nonprofit, where you have hundreds or even thousands of stakeholders, and you have to try and generate energy around a vision. Let people see that it\u2019s in their self-interest or the self-interest of the people that they represent to get on board with your vision. And that you\u2019re willing to compromise and work with them. That is the way I would lead as president.\nMr. Yang told Vox\u2019s Recode that one of the reasons he quit Venture for America, the nonprofit he created, was because he realized it couldn\u2019t achieve the change he wanted at the necessary scale. For instance, it had fallen short of the 100,000 jobs he set out for it to create.\nDonald Trump does not speak for every non-politician or nonmilitary officer. But there is a deep need, and you\u2019ve seen this, because you spent time in D.C., the D.C. establishment will not generate big solutions.\nOne of the reasons why Donald Trump is our president is that millions of Americans feel like our government is unresponsive to our needs and the needs in our communities. They\u2019ve been casting about for some sort of change agent for years. And it\u2019s not just Donald Trump\u2019s victory; it was Bernie Sanders outsized success. In some ways, it was even Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. If you remember that campaign, it was oh, hope, change. It was not, get the most experienced person in the seat as possible, because we are decades behind the curve in addressing the problems and challenges that are tearing us apart. Now \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has frequently said that automation contributed heavily to Mr. Trump\u2019s win, because voters feel disaffected and worry that the futures of their jobs and industries are in jeopardy.\nKK: Do you feel like President Obama achieved the change that he had promised in the 2008 campaign?\nI think that he did a lot of great things and he did a lot of what he could, but to the extent that there was a missed opportunity, it was in the wake of the financial crisis. And it\u2019s very hard to Monday morning quarterback a team when they literally felt like the economy itself was at stake, but we should have done much more to recapitalize homeowners as opposed to the banks. We could have kept many more people in their homes. We could\u2019ve kept many of these communities \u2014\u2014\nA critique of President Obama\u2019s financial policies by Matt Stoller, of the Open Markets Institute, argues that the Obama administration let banking executives off the hook for their role in the financial crisis and enabled nine million foreclosures.\nBS: Without a doubt.\n\u2014\u2014 more strong and more whole. There\u2019s a saying, I think it was actually, and maybe in this \u2026 no, it was an earlier administration, but a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. There was a crisis. There was a massive opportunity to help rebalance our economy, but we instead recapitalized the banks to the tune of $4 trillion. And what I say to Americans around the country, I say, \u201cHey, do you remember voting for the $4 trillion bailout of Wall Street\u201d? And it gets this laugh. But then they answer, \u201cWait, we did that\u201d? And it\u2019s, \u201cOf course we didn\u2019t vote for that.\u201d\n\u201cA crisis is a terrible thing to waste\u201d is a quote attributed to the Stanford economist Paul Romer. He made the comment at a meeting in 2004, referring to the competition America faces from the rising education levels around the globe. Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama\u2019s chief of staff, later echoed the statement after President Obama\u2019s election.\nSo, that to me was the biggest missed opportunity in the Obama administration, and it happened very, very early on. I wish that they owned and reflected a little bit on the fact that maybe they could have done some things differently at that stage, because we\u2019re still angry. This country is still angry. I was so shocked by what happened in the financial crisis, I quit my job and started a national nonprofit and ran it for seven years. I had \u2014 my wife was pregnant. I mean, what happened to this country then is still tearing us apart.\nMr. Yang started Venture for America in 2011, shortly after selling his test prep company to Kaplan. He said that he saw, in the wake of the financial crisis, how certain communities were rapidly losing jobs and wanted to create new work opportunities in those underserved areas.\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Yang, can you say who is on your short list for running mate?\nI love this question.\nLK: So do we.\nWell, one of the joys of running for president is you get to know incredible people on the trail, including some of the other contenders. I\u2019m on the record saying I would prefer to have a female running mate. I think teams run better if you have men and women leaders at the highest possible levels. I joke, but it\u2019s mostly true, that if you get too many men alone for too long, we kind of become morons. So we need to keep that from happening at the highest levels.\nMr. Yang confirmed this summer that he would like his running mate to be a woman.\nMC: He has my vote. All right. [LAUGHTER]\nBut at the same time, in order to have someone at that level of relationship, you need to have as much trust as possible and I\u2019m still developing that kind of relationship with some of the other, not just candidates, but also people who could be running mates that are not currently running.\nMr. Yang has scored internet points with some tweets paying tribute to former 2020 Democratic rivals, for example by tweeting \u201cI miss Beto.\u201d\nLK: So no names yet.\nNo names yet, no.\nKK: Do you feel like you need to have a running mate who has operated in Washington before or who has previous government experience?\nAlmost certainly, yes. And you saw it a little bit with Barack Obama where he tapped Joe Biden in part because Joe had very deep relationships on Capitol Hill. If you had another outsider like me, we\u2019d still be trying to figure out who to call. So, you need to have folks who have deep relationships on Capitol Hill from day one.\nLK: Speaking of women, I wanted to ask you about reproductive rights as well. You told some of our colleagues in the newsroom that you would consider some executive actions to protect reproductive rights, but I haven\u2019t seen any details about what actions you\u2019re considering. Do you have any details to share with us about that?\nWell, I\u2019m all about trying to improve the reality on the ground, to the extent that we can actually put resources and funds to work in communities to make sure that women have access to reproductive rights in clinics. Certainly any way we can make sure that there aren\u2019t any obstacles to the funding of Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. I would take those actions immediately. A lot of the legislative actions, you need a bit more time and a bit more buy-in from Congress, but at the Supreme Court level, I would consider appointing more justices if it was necessary to safeguard women\u2019s reproductive rights.\nMr. Yang has argued that more legislative oversight on reproductive issues should come from physicians rather than politicians. He tweeted: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think male legislators should be weighing in on women\u2019s reproductive rights and freedoms.\u201d\nKK: You mean, you would in addition to the nine that we already have?\nIn addition to the nine we already have. I believe that \u2014 so if you look at the Constitution, there is nothing there that stipulates the number of Supreme Court justices. We\u2019ve had fewer than nine, we\u2019ve had more than nine. I think that appointing new justices would be helpful on several levels. It would help depoliticize the process, at least marginally, because if you have 17 justices and one steps down, then it\u2019s not as much of an earthquake. Well, right now we we\u2019re hinging our laws on the health of an octogenarian. It would literally be rational for us to all just to follow Ruth Bader Ginsburg around and just scrub any door knob she touches. You know what I mean?\nJustice Bader Ginsburg has had a series of health scares in recent years, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment. She also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009.\nJW: You remember what happened the last time a president tried to do this, right?\nYeah. And I think in some ways, there\u2019s some positive lessons to be drawn from that time, because there were some significant accomplishments during that era.\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt tried to advance a \u201ccourt-packing\u201d strategy to ensure favorable rulings on New Deal legislation. He wanted to appoint up to six additional justices, one for every justice older than 70 years. The plan was unpopular in Congress and among the Supreme Court\u2019s justices.\nKK: So, can you give us some names of people you would nominate to the Supreme Court?\nThat\u2019s a fun exercise, too. I haven\u2019t gotten into the judicial appointment shortlist yet, but safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive rights would be one clear criteria. Because women\u2019s reproductive rights are fundamental human rights in my mind.\nI think it\u2019s actually unfortunate that I get asked about those sorts of questions, in the sense that I feel like men should leave the room and let women decide what to do with your bodies. I have a feeling I know what you would decide, and then we could come back and say, \u201cHey, what did you decide\u201d? I also think that if men got pregnant, this would be a very, very different conversation. And we\u2019d have a completely different approach to these issues. So, I don\u2019t have a short list of Supreme Court justice appointees, but safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive rights and having an evolving sense of the law would be very important.\nWe need to modernize the court. Lifetime appointments might have made sense at one point a long time ago, but when the Constitution was drafted, people did not live as long. And also, people stepped down from the Supreme Court for any of a range of reasons. They did not wait until they were at death\u2019s door. This is not a way to run a 21st-century society.\nWe should have 18-year term limits, increase the number of justices, make it so it\u2019s predictable that you lose an election, the other party might get one or two justices, and then we don\u2019t need to literally be monitoring the health of our justices. Or, the most ridiculous thing is you\u2019re literally looking at the age of the person you\u2019re appointing being, \u201cOoh, this person will be there for 30, 40 years.\u201d What kind of system do you want where you\u2019re having a society decide 30 years ago what women\u2019s rights are today? Doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nJW: Are you concerned that you wouldn\u2019t be triggering a sort of a war of \u2014 a back and forth between Republicans and Democrats, who were continuing to add justices to the bench with each new administration to satisfy their own policy priorities?\nIf you have term limits, it is bipartisan. Because \u2014\u2014\nJW: Right, but you\u2019re talking about expanding the court, too, and if you expand the court, as you say correctly, that it\u2019s a federal law, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution about the number of justices. You expand it to 13, the next Republican who comes in, who is furious about women having too many reproductive rights, will expand it to 17 to overturn the rulings you just got. So, how doesn\u2019t that just become \u2014 doesn\u2019t devolve into \u2014\u2014\nCourt packing isn\u2019t a violation of any part of the Constitution, but it is widely debated with critics pointing out that it would trigger severe political backlash.\nBS: An arms race.\nWell, I would suggest that one side has been acting as if it is an arms race. And so, in that environment, it\u2019s only appropriate to respond in a way that you think would help move the country and our legal system in the right direction. Can I talk \u2014 oh.\nJeneen Interlandi: Oh no, go ahead.\nJW: I just wanted to tie together the question \u2014 a question from Lauren and a question from Michelle, and ask you about Washington, both with regard to Supreme Court confirmation process and your agenda more generally. You said at the very beginning of our conversation, in response to Katie, that you don\u2019t need a \u2014 you were talking about various [cross talk].\nYeah, you said you don\u2019t need 80 percent of Congress, you need a majority. And I would push back and say neither of those is correct. You need 60 percent of the Senate currently. The question is, how do you plan to get things done, even if you had a Democratic majority in the Senate? Which I think is right now less than an even chance. How do you propose getting your agenda through Congress when the filibuster is in place?\nTo your earlier concern, I think we should examine the filibuster. I think that gridlock is bad for anyone trying to get anything done and solve problems. This might be controversial in this room, but I am for the restoration of earmarks, because it helped make legislation possible. That if I was a congressperson in a district, and there was a bill being passed, it\u2019s, \u201cHey, at least I can get some pork for my local museum.\u201d And that\u2019s a very small price to pay for a functional legislature. So, getting past the filibuster to me is one possible necessity, and the restoration of earmarks could be another.\nEarmarking allows Congress to appropriate discretionary funds for specific projects. Mr. Yang supports them because he feels they allow representatives to generate revenue for their constituents to offset costs their area might experience from a given piece of legislation.\nJW: And let me just, one last follow-up on that. If Democrats don\u2019t take back the Senate, how do you feel with the Supreme Court \u2014 how do you, I mean, put aside expanding the number of justices, how do you even get a justice onto the court in the first place?\nIt\u2019s obviously much harder. I\u2019m all about trying to maximize the possible. And so, if we don\u2019t get a majority \u2014 I expect the Democrats will win a slight majority in the Senate. I\u2019m very optimistic that way, but we\u2019re going to get done what we can get done with the branch of the government we have control of. And I will say too, I believe that we can get some things done that are traditionally bipartisan, regardless of who has control of the Senate. To me, I cannot believe that we did not get infrastructure done during the first couple of years of the Trump administration. I thought at least he would build some bridges and roads, and I was even willing to accept the Trump name on those bridges and roads if it got some bridges and roads built. I was, \u201cAt least we\u2019re going to get this.\u201d\nThe editorial board recently called for the Trump administration to break the impasse on funding for the proposed rail tunnel under the Hudson River in an editorial titled: \u201cBuild the Donald J. Trump Tunnel.\u201d The vital infrastructure project has stalled because of political infighting.\nKK: We\u2019ve called for that, too.\nReally? So, we have to get done what we can get done. And if we have to focus on things that are traditionally bipartisan, I\u2019d be excited to lead with that. I mean, I\u2019d be much more excited to lead with a much bigger agenda to balance out this economy, to work for people. And I will say that\u2019s bipartisan, too. When I go around to Americans around the country, if you were to go to a room of Republicans and say, \u201cHey, how do you feel about Amazon paying zero in taxes\u201d? They\u2019re not excited about that. They feel like this economy is rigged against them and their families, and they\u2019re generally correct, and that is bipartisan.\nJI: You\u2019ve proposed legalizing gambling at the federal level, regulating it.\nKK: Online.\nJI: Yeah, online gambling.\nJust online poker.\nJI: Yes. Regulating it heavily and using the revenue to treat gambling addiction. Can you talk through that? You say on your website that you think gambling addiction doesn\u2019t get nearly enough attention, and it is a really important issue. How does legalizing gambling, even if you use the revenue, not make that problem worse?\nAny American who wants to gamble online on a poker site can do so from any state in the country right now. If it\u2019s illegal in your state, you just end up using an offshore betting site, which is shady, has problems, but it\u2019s not going to ease your gambling addiction at all. So the question is, do we want Americans, in the vast majority of the country, on offshore betting sites, dealing with shady characters and generating no revenue and still being addicted? Or would we prefer that they do business with American firms, where we do have better regulations, we know they\u2019re not getting cheated, we know they\u2019re not getting exploited, and you generate tax revenue that you can use to treat gambling addiction.\nMr. Yang\u2019s campaign estimates that federally regulating the U.S. online poker market could raise $2.2 billion just in its first year. The campaign also argues that federal regulation would make it easier to combat money laundering.\nJI: So, what steps would you take to take that money and create a gambling addiction treatment program or system? So, what exactly would you do to get from A to B?\nI mean, you could make it so it\u2019s analogous to what happened in the tobacco industry, where there\u2019s a certain level of revenue that gets set aside and then you have various public service announcements.\nPresident Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in 2009, which gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to fully regulate the sale of tobacco products.\nJI: In that system, a lot of that money didn\u2019t actually go to treating tobacco-related health problems. A lot of it went to shoring up state budgets, and some of them even went to the tobacco industry actually, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best model.\nIn 2007 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that states direct 14 percent of funds from tobacco taxes and the national settlement toward antismoking campaigns, but most states have funneled it toward other areas, from agriculture to literacy.\nOh, you might not want to push the money to the states and then have them determine how to use it in their budgets. You could empower a national program or an agency to help administer it at the federal level, if you didn\u2019t trust the states to actually use it in the right way.\nJI: I actually really quickly want to go back to a question that Binya was asking you. You said, you gave us the example of parents with two kids and you\u2019re on food stamps and you\u2019re worried about your kids\u2019 future. And at the end of that explanation, you said that you are not for curtailing social supports, but isn\u2019t your plan such that, that mother, aside from what the kids would get in the future, that mother would have to choose between the food stamps and the actual U.B.I., right? Is that correct?\nThat is correct. But when I\u2019ve dug into it, very, very few Americans are getting $1,000 in food stamps. And most of the people who are on government assistance live in fear of losing that assistance because there are various requirements that tend to come with it. And when, if you ask them, say, \u201cHey, would you prefer $1,000 unconditional that you can rely upon,\u201d they actually think that\u2019s too good to be true.\nJI: Sure. But to Binya\u2019s point, it\u2019s still a trade-off. So, if I\u2019m on food stamps, I\u2019m getting less of a benefit than, say, Jesse, who\u2019s not on food stamps.\nWell to me, playing the relative benefit game, I mean of course in any large scale national program, it\u2019s you can\u2019t calibrate it precisely to everyone\u2019s individual situation. To me the test is more, is that person going to be better off tomorrow than they are today?\nKK: So I want to move on. We have some more personal questions for you.\nReally?\nKK: I think Mara\u2019s going to kick you off.\nMG: So, if you become president, what government secret are you most excited to learn about?\nDefinitely aliens, of course.\nKK: O.K.\nThat\u2019d be my first question if I got in there, I\u2019d be, \u201cAll right, let me see them. Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve been hiding all of these years.\u201d\nKK: And, who has broken your heart?\nWow, these questions are really fun. Who\u2019s broken my heart?\nBS: Don\u2019t be tactical now.\nThis is \u2014 I mean, this is going to make me very sad to say, but I feel like I had an arc or a relationship with President Obama, where it was inspirational when he won. I was celebrating with my wife in the streets. And then over the years I began to feel like we\u2019d missed a great opportunity. So, I\u2019d say there was some heartbreak attached to that. And I worked with the president afterward, and I still admire him a great deal, but I think we could have done a lot more, and I don\u2019t think opportunities like that come along very often.\nThe Obama administration named Mr. Yang a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship in 2015 and a Champion of Change in 2012.\nKK: For millions of Americans, church and religion are the centers of their communities. Do you believe in God? Do you go to church regularly? Who are your spiritual advisers?\nI grew up in an entirely secular household. My parents did not talk about God in the house, but I had this instinctive belief in a higher power. I had many Christian relatives. I went to church over holidays growing up quite often. And then I married my wife, Evelyn, who\u2019s Christian. And so, we\u2019re raising our kids in a Christian church. I go to church when I\u2019m home, which is not very often unfortunately nowadays. I enjoy it. My faith is still very much a journey, but I\u2019m unreservedly thrilled about the impact it has on my wife, my boys, my family, my community.\nMr. Yang was raised in New York; his parents immigrated from Taiwan.\nBS: Which denomination?\nIt\u2019s a progressive Protestant church. We primarily go upstate, where we have a house in a town called New Paltz. They\u2019ve got a rainbow flag up front. It\u2019s a very welcoming community.\nMr. Yang and his family began attending Sunday services at the Reformed Church of New Paltz after they purchased a home nearby in 2015.\nMG: Actually just a quick follow-up. When was the last time you rode the subway?\nI rode the subway maybe six weeks ago or so. It\u2019s become much more of a pain in the neck now that I actually get recognized. I confess that that\u2019s been the biggest adjustment in running for president. Because I was, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to get recognized on the street.\u201d Of course, keep in mind, when I started my run I was completely anonymous. I mean none of you had ever heard of me. And also there is, and this is not to make too much of it, but there\u2019s also this invisible Asian man thing. That you feel like all you have to do is just not want to be seen and then you disappear, and that doesn\u2019t work anymore.\nWhen I\u2019m on the subway, people will look at me and then look at me. And then eventually someone will inch over and say, \u201cHey, you running for president\u201d? And then I\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d They\u2019ll say, \u201cYeah, yeah, I like you. Thousand bucks a month,\u201d something like that. And then they want to take pictures. And then as soon as someone breaks the seal, then it\u2019s safe for everyone to do it. And so, then I\u2019ll be \u2014 and then there\u2019s this uncomfortable period in this subway car after you\u2019ve taken the pictures with him, you\u2019re still sitting there. And so then they\u2019re, \u201cSo, where are you going? Or, how\u2019s Bernie\u201d? Or whatever the questions are. And so, I have not been riding the subway lately, but I\u2019ve ridden the subway an awful lot over the years. Now my preferred mode of transportation is the bike, because if someone recognizes me, it\u2019s generally too late.\nKK: I thought you were going to say it\u2019s a lot harder to ride the subway now because of the breakdowns of New York infrastructure.\nIn 2017, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York\u2019s subway and pledged $1 billion for improvements. The editorial board has repeatedly called for action to make the subways workable for this paper\u2019s millions of readers.\nThat too. I mean, it\u2019s rough. But I mean, New York\u2019s going through \u2014 I just want to bring some things to you from experience. Like yeah, the infrastructure breaking down. I mean, we\u2019re coasting on the investments made decades ago and they\u2019re starting to fall apart. But also what you all do in terms of journalism \u2014 I\u2019ve been campaigning around the country and over 1,200 local papers have gone out of business because the local establishments that used to advertise are gone. All of their classified revenue went off to Craigslist and democracy works much less if you don\u2019t have local journalism.\nA report released by PEN America in November found that more than 1,800 local print outlets have closed since 2004, and at least 200 counties have no newspaper.\nThis, to me, is an emblem of what\u2019s gone wrong in American life. Where the market is all knowing and all powerful, and if the market decides that local journalism has zero value, then it has zero value. And that is not the way forward for us. We need to make our own independent determination of our own value as people, of the value of local journalism, of the value of arts, of the value of volunteering, of caregiving, of \u2014 like all the most important things in American life. And so you, in many ways, you\u2019re like the guardians of this incredible journalistic tradition, and it\u2019s like a unique privilege because the people who\u2019ve pursued the same vocation in other parts of the country are just seeing it disappear.\nKK: Do you believe in government subsidies for journalism?\nYes. I have three major pro-journalism proposals on my website, including federally funding journalists for every congressional district, billions of dollars in grants to help transition local journalism. Matching grants, so you\u2019re not like saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to do this.\u201d But matching grants to help transition them to cooperative models of ownership to nonprofit and philanthropic models.\nOne criticism of government subsidized journalism is that it could stifle the media\u2019s capacity to serve as a watchdog.\nYou can build it around the town library, because a lot of them have this bulletin board that serves as the skeleton of a local paper when the local paper has gone out of business. A lot of these papers would be able to get by if they did not have to generate stock market level returns for hedge fund owners and private equity owners. If you had a cooperative model and it\u2019s made a certain amount of money, spent a certain amount of money, ran as a nonprofit, you could restore and sustain local journalism and thousands of communities, but it will not happen without government support. It just won\u2019t.\nKK: Think you might be overly optimistic. Maybe we\u2019ll move on to foreign policy, if you don\u2019t mind?\nSure. Yeah.\nAlex Kingsbury: Another thing the country\u2019s invested in quite a lot is the military, and as commander in chief, you\u2019d be in charge of that. Can you tell me how many aircraft carriers the United States Navy has?\nOh my gosh.\nAK: Whether or not the Navy is big enough to meet its commitments with the Chinese and the South China Sea? What\u2019s going on in the Persian Gulf? What do you think?\nI think the number of aircraft carriers is either seven or nine. I confess to not knowing precisely. In terms of our investment, we\u2019re spending $650 billion plus on our military. Certainly more than any other country, but I think more than the next four countries combined, and we have to examine, at this stage, whether that $650 billion is making us safer and more secure.\nThe correct answer is 11.\nWhat are the true threats of the 21st century? Climate change is number one, and then cybersecurity and A.I., loose nuclear material, military drones in the hands of nonstate actors. It\u2019s very hard to secure a location from something the size of a flying vacuum cleaner. That\u2019s very, very difficult. So we\u2019re entering an era where it\u2019s going to be much easier to be offensive than defensive, and you don\u2019t need massive levels of resources to cause significant levels of damage. To me, a new aircraft carrier does not make our elections any more secure from Russian hacking, which is the most direct threat to our democracy upcoming in this cycle. We\u2019re spending money on the threats of the 20th century, and we need to try and modernize our approach as quickly as possible.\nAK: The president at the moment is at a NATO summit, or he might\u2019ve left \u2014\u2014\nI saw the headlines about how people were making fun of him. I was like, \u201cOh man, this is really \u2014 we really have to put an end to this administration.\u201d\nMr. Trump canceled a planned news conference at a NATO gathering in December after a video circulated that showed world leaders including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Emmanuel Macron of France in what appeared to be a conversation mocking Mr. Trump.\nAK: But one of his priorities has been to get our European allies to spend more money on their own defense. And I wonder if you think that that\u2019s a worthwhile goal and how you might go about it, if you agree that that\u2019s something that should be a priority for the United States.\nTo me, one of the worst things you can do in a relationship is if you have this longstanding understanding or a friendship or partnership, and then you try and change the understanding at a particular point in time and do it unilaterally.\nWe need to let our historic allies know that our commitments are good, and that if we want to make a change, we want to do it in a way that\u2019s not pulling the rug out from under you but actually consultative. If we want other people to invest more, then we have to try and sit down with them and drive them to do so without questioning our commitment to NATO wholesale. But to me, trying to nickel-and-dime our relationships with our historic allies is not the best way forward. I think it was James Mattis that said that if you invest more in diplomacy, you have to invest less in ammunition, which should be the goal. So we need to make sure our partnerships and alliances are actually strong, stable and secure, and then we can put pressure on Russia and China with more of a global consensus, and maintain the international world order that\u2019s benefited us for decades that now is falling apart because Donald Trump is so erratic and unreliable, even with the people we\u2019ve been allies with for decades.\nIn response to announcements about Mr. Trump\u2019s planned cuts to State Department funding, retired generals wrote a letter to lawmakers citing Secretary of Defense James Mattis\u2019s 2013 comment, \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition ultimately.\u201d\nAK: Speaking of allies, should Ukraine be invited to join NATO? I know that Ukraine\u2019s received sort of undue influence on this election, but going forward?\nI mean, that\u2019s not solely an American decision. NATO expansion is something that is fraught and elevates tensions with Russia in particular. I think we should explore it. I\u2019m sympathetic, but it\u2019s not a decision we can make alone.\nA recent poll found that roughly 50 percent of the Ukrainian population favors joining NATO, though Hungary\u2019s foreign minister recently said his country would block Ukrainian membership unless Ukraine changed a policy restricting its citizens\u2019 use of minority languages.\nKK: Do you think \u2014 speaking of allies, do you think Turkey is still an ally to the United States, and do you think the U.S. should have nuclear weapons there?\nThis is what\u2019s so tough right now is that countries are trying to figure out what are the benefits of being an ally of the United States and doing what we want them to do, and then what are the costs. Unfortunately that calculation is going against us more and more. Turkey\u2019s relationship with the U.S. has been stronger than our relationship with many other countries in that region. I think we should invest in that relationship if we\u2019re going to be able to accomplish any of our goals there. And that includes, to me, being a little bit more accommodating about behaviors that we might find objectionable or troubling from them than we might from another country.\nSerge Schmemann: Yeah. And staying with relationships and alliances, President Trump has reversed several key policies the United States has had toward Israel. He\u2019s moved the embassy to Jerusalem, he\u2019s recognized sovereignty over the Golan Heights, et cetera, et cetera. Would you reverse those?\nHistorically, we\u2019ve endorsed a two-state solution, which has always struck me as the best way forward, and I think it\u2019s really unfortunate that Donald Trump has moved us away from that to the extent that he has. I would try to move us back in that direction.\nMr. Yang has frequently reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution but has not released any detailed plans about how he would advance an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan or address Mr. Trump\u2019s policies in the region. He told the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cI don\u2019t want to prescribe the specifics of a two-state solution, as the Israeli and Palestinian people both need to be leading any conversation, and I look forward to engaging with all stakeholders.\u201d\nSS: O.K. Again, about your responsibilities as president. One of the heaviest ones would be waging war. When you look back on the conflicts into which recent presidents have put us, would you support this? Is this something you would have done in Syria, in Libya, in Kosovo? Would you have sent troops there?\nSo I have a three-part test for sending troops into harm\u2019s way. Number one, it needs to advance a vital American interest or avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Number two, it has to have a clearly defined timeline where we can look troops in the eyes and say, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take this long and you\u2019re going to be able to accomplish our mission and then you\u2019re going to be able to come home.\u201d And not some boardroom self-delusion, like you actually believe that you\u2019re going to get it done and then be able to bring them home in that time frame. And number three, we\u2019re not going in alone; there are allies joining us in the mission. If those three things are in place, then I would consider sending our troops into harm\u2019s way.\nGenerally speaking, I think we have become overly aggressive and optimistic about what we can accomplish in various foreign theaters. I\u2019ve signed a pledge to end the forever wars because I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the will of the American people for us to be in a constant state of armed conflict in foreign theaters for years and even decades at a time. Our Constitution says that it\u2019s in Congress\u2019s hands to declare war, but Congress has completely ceded this authority through the A.U.M.F. [Authorization for Use of Military Force] and then just said, \u201cHey, executive branch, you can do what you want.\u201d And now they want nothing to do with it, and that is not the will of the American people, and it\u2019s not the will of the Constitution. So we should repeal the A.U.M.F. and say, \u201cLook, Congress, if we want to authorize armed conflict, it should be on you and it should be the will of the people.\u201d\nCommon Defense\u2019s \u201cEnd the Forever War\u201d pledge advocates for an \u201cexpedient conclusion\u201d to the global war on terror and American military involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, and Mr. Yang became the fourth candidate to sign on, in May, following Senators Sanders and Warren (and former Senator Mike Gravel).\nSS: Concretely, would you have sent troops, say, to Syria?\nNo. I\u2019d have to look at the facts at the time that that decision was being made.\nJames Dao: Can I pose a future hypothetical? If the Chinese government were to flood Hong Kong with military troops after you were president and impose a violent crackdown, similar to, say, Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do?\nI have family in Hong Kong. I spent a semester there in college, and so when I see those streets wracked with riots and violence, I actually remember being on those streets. And so it\u2019s incredibly jarring, and it\u2019s an extraordinary situation because of Hong Kong\u2019s status as this semiautonomous region that\u2019s being reintegrated back into China.\nOur best path forward with China is to try and have them continue to show restraint, but also see that the costs to human rights abuse is not just in Hong Kong, but with their ethnic minorities and the Muslim population of Uighurs, that the costs are higher than their perceived benefits of maintaining social order and stability. In order to have those costs feel real to the Chinese, we can\u2019t just moralize and say, \u201cHey, do the right thing.\u201d Because at this point they\u2019re looking at us and saying like, \u201cKeep your opinions and value statements to yourselves.\u201d\nWe have to be working toward China\u2019s second main priority, which is maintaining robust economic growth. So there are two goals. There are two primary goals that are sometimes in tension, of maintaining social order and maintaining robust economic growth. And the best way we can try and contain their behavior in Hong Kong is to say, \u201cLook, the economic costs are going to be very, very high.\u201d And the best way we can do that is to build global consensus around certain norms and behaviors.\nAt the last debate, I proposed a world data organization, because to me, China\u2019s in position to leapfrog us in artificial intelligence. They\u2019re investing tens of billions in a way that our government is not. It\u2019s a national effort. And they\u2019ve now separated their technology ecosystem from the West\u2019s and they\u2019re trying to sell their software and operating systems to other countries with very limited success right now, but this parallel tech universe, to me, is something that we can actually use to bring China back to the table.\nThat\u2019s why something like world data organization is so vital. When they had to join the W.T.O. [World Trade Organization], they realized this was going to be vital to their economic growth, so they\u2019re going to have to make some decisions and compromises in order to join the world order. We can create an analogous situation for data and technology and then use that to try and curb some of their worst abuses and behaviors. Now, is this going to happen in time to help Hong Kong? I certainly hope so. I mean, I certainly hope that they don\u2019t flood the streets of Hong Kong with troops any time in the next number of days or weeks.\nMr. Yang has been critical of China\u2019s \u201cincreasingly authoritarian\u201d behavior and told the Council on Foreign Relations the United States must in reply demonstrate \u201ca model for democratic capitalism.\u201d\nKK: And do you think President Xi is a dictator?\nI think he meets just about every conventional definition of dictator. Yes.\nCharlie Warzel: You were talking about data and that\u2019s a good segue into some of the \u2014 I mean, you\u2019re probably the candidate who sort of runs on understanding the internet better than anyone right now. And I\u2019m curious first about this worldwide data organization. For someone like China, wouldn\u2019t it actually be better for them to sort of hoard that data and hoard that information and keep that closed system?\nMr. Yang has proposed what he describes as \u201ca W.T.O. for data\u201d and has argued that data ownership should be made a property right. Some argue that such an organization could enable more partnership among countries in setting standards for artificial intelligence and data.\nSo this is the carrot and the stick. So imagine if you had data standards that were endorsed by the U.S., the E.U., and Japan, and it had certain technology protocols associated with it. Then China said, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t want to adhere to that.\u201d Because like you said, they like to hoard data, and one of the reasons why they\u2019re in position to leapfrog us is they have more data than we do and they have essentially nonexistent privacy rights or regulations. They have complete surveillance. That\u2019s one reason why they\u2019ve banned masks in Hong Kong, so that their surveillance technology can pick up who the protesters are. So China has its own vast hoard of data.\nThere has been a continuing controversy over Hong Kong\u2019s law banning masks to target anti-government protesters. One court ruling found it unconstitutional, but a later ruling temporarily reinstated it.\nBut for them the challenge is not even what\u2019s happening internally. The challenge is whether or not they can get developing countries on board with their technology standards to be able to roll them out internationally. So if you\u2019re a third party, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a developing country in Africa or Latin America, then you have a choice essentially between the global standard and the Chinese standard. And if you\u2019re the Chinese, you do not want a standard that only you are using over time, because that\u2019s going to curb your economic upside to all of the software that you\u2019re building. One of the reasons why our tech companies are so successful is that they export it to virtually the entire rest of the world, and China does not want to be in the opposite position.\nCW: I\u2019m curious, then, focusing on the U.S., a couple of months ago the general counsel for the N.S.A. wrote an Op-Ed for us and was worried about this big challenge of the government not being able to acquire the tech talent. That Silicon Valley is actually so much more attractive, so much more interesting there. And that when you\u2019re looking at 5G technology, quantum computing, technology, A.I., not having engineers in that space and sort of outsourcing that to the private sector is potentially incredibly dangerous. Like how do you actually make people want to come and bring that engineering talent to the federal government, rather than \u2014\u2014\nKK: Especially given your proposal for Department of the Attention Economy.\nWell, the Department of the Attention Economy would likely be based in Silicon Valley, and it\u2019d be run by a guy named Tristan Harris, who\u2019s a design ethicist. He started Time Well Spent. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the case that you need to try and bring everyone into the cubicles in D.C. to get the rules \u2014\u2014\nMr. Yang has been the most vocal of all candidates about privacy issues. Tristan Harris, whom he has alluded to in discussing the Department of the Attention Economy, spent three years as a Google design ethicist. He left to found the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that seeks to address the \u201cdigital attention crisis.\u201d\nKK: I meant more make people want to work for government? And I think that\u2019s your question, right?\nCW: Yeah. Rather than, you know, a big exit or something like that. Sexy start-up.\nSo the clearest emblem of this is NASA and space travel where we all watched the Apollo 13 movies and we\u2019ve seen the armies of research scientists helping launch these missions. Now where those research scientists? They\u2019re all at Space X and Blue Origin and they\u2019re there working for the tech guys who are putting billions into it. It\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to somehow reverse essentially decades of talent migration into the private sector. And if you\u2019re a talented kid out of Stanford, why would you work for the federal government? It\u2019s like if you\u2019re working in the private sector, you feel like you\u2019re going to go faster, you\u2019re certainly going to get paid more. You\u2019re going to be working with smarter people and you idolize Elon Musk, like who the heck, you know?\nKK: Yeah, that\u2019s literally our question.\nAY: Yeah. And I will say on a personal level, I spent seven years recruiting some of our top educational products to Detroit, Cleveland, Birmingham, St. Louis. So I have seen that essentially the tide has turned in the direction it\u2019s gone and we should not be relying upon the government as the primary employer of a lot of this tech talent. We have to face facts and say, at this point, most of the intellectual capital is being attracted to these private firms and we need to instead try and support and work with the private firms.\nThrough Venture for America, Mr. Yang created opportunities for college graduates in under-resourced American cities \u2014 but almost half of V.F.A. alumni left the cities they were placed in through the fellowship.\nCW: Well, what about when it comes to like the N.S.A. and the technology they have and the surveillance? You don\u2019t want Google doing surveillance of people here and abroad?\nBS: Any more than they already are.\nCW: More than they already are. Right.\nMore than they already are.\nCW: But doing it in a national security sense. Or do you?\nI mean, the question is what trade-offs you\u2019re willing to make, really. The N.S.A. is going to be able to recruit the tech talent that he can recruit and you want to try and ramp that up. So one thing \u2014\u2014\nCW: They\u2019re worried about it.\nThey should be, I mean clearly. Because if you spend time on these campuses, you know where they\u2019re going. So one thing you can do that\u2019s very, very fast and immediate is you can become much more flexible in terms of compensation and a type of work environment.\nSo if you had, for example, a rule that said, \u201cLook, the government is allowed to match whatever salary a private sector employee is being offered, then you\u2019d have more success.\u201d If you said, \u201cLook, you don\u2019t need to move to Washington, D.C., and sit in the thing that was built decades ago, that\u2019s like solace, and you have this giant parking lot and you just feel miserable being there for like a day, let alone a career.\u201d\nMr. Yang has said \u201cmost Americans don\u2019t want to work for the federal government\u201d and argued that his Freedom Dividend would therefore be more effective than a program like a federal jobs guarantee.\nIt seems like a nice place to work. Then you might have greater success. We also saw this happen even with the rollout of healthcare.gov. Remember this? It\u2019s like they had the consultant and then they totally botched it and then they needed to bring in the \u2014\u2014\nBS: Remember The New Yorker cartoon?\nHm?\nBS: The New Yorker cartoon. They had a secretary with like a floppy disk. With her glasses pulled down and her fingers crossed.\nSee The New Yorker satirizing the Affordable Care Act rollout here.\nAnd it\u2019s not just the leading edge N.S.A.-type stuff. If you look around congressional offices or the I.R.S., they\u2019re all using technology from the \u201990s or whatever it is. I had a whiz kid who said he got yelled at for writing a script in a congressional office that automated a task. They were like, \u201cNo, we just wanted you to do it manually forever.\u201d So there needs to be a massive modernization effort. Not just in terms of how we recruit tech talent at the highest levels, but how we function even in the basics.\nCW: Sort of pivoting off of that, you said that Senator Warren\u2019s taking sort of a 20th-century antitrust framework to big tech. What does a 21st-century framework look like in that?\nThe 21st-century framework. First, you don\u2019t use price as your primary determinant of whether or not there are antitrust problems, because the tech companies would say, \u201cWhat? We would never gouge anyone. It\u2019s free. We\u2019re underselling everyone.\u201d So that you have to get rid of, and that\u2019s not something she\u2019s advocating, but what she is advocating, which I find to be a bit backward looking, is thinking that competition is the answer in these spaces. And competition misses the point in one way and another way.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, like Mr. Yang, has argued that the country\u2019s approach to antitrust regulation is outmoded. In early 2019, the Federal Trade Commission created a new task force focused on monitoring competition in technology markets, which the foundation celebrated as a step toward modernizing antitrust.\nLet me explain. I\u2019m a parent. I\u2019ve got \u2014 how many of you all are parents? So if your kids are like my kids, they are mesmerized by any screen that is nearby. I regularly challenge my kids. I say, \u201cWhat\u2019s more important? People or screens?\u201d And they know the right answer\u2019s people. And then if they say screens, then I hold them upside down by their ankles until they say, \u201cPeople, people.\u201d And the people that are most diligent about screen time are the tech folks in Silicon Valley. You go there, and all of a sudden there\u2019s not a screen to be had because they know that we have the smartest engineers in the country turning supercomputers into dopamine delivery devices for kids, because that\u2019s how they make their millions of dollars.\nSo if that\u2019s your problem and you break Facebook into Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, does that somehow make the kids stronger or healthier? No. If anything, it actually ratchets up the incentives to try and further their engagement.\nSo if that\u2019s your problem, you have to go and try and solve it directly by getting into the guts of the apps and say, \u201cWhat are the design choices you made?\u201d Let\u2019s calibrate them so they actually balance our kids\u2019 health and not just your financial returns. So that\u2019s one way she\u2019s missing the point.\nThe other way is that many of these competitive markets end up very quickly accelerating toward one or two winners and saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to break you up.\u201d Does not solve that problem. I joke that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to say you have to use the fourth-best navigation app. Like what is that? Apple Maps. We all hate Apple Maps, right? If you use that thing, you\u2019re like, \u201cOh.\u201d You curse the gods until you figure out how to get Google Maps going. So going up and saying, \u201cLook, you\u2019re the winner in the space. We\u2019re going to break you up,\u201d it doesn\u2019t revive Main Street businesses, and it doesn\u2019t actually end up solving the competition problem.\nIf you want to solve the hyperacquisition problem, which is a problem, then you have to go in and say, \u201cLook, you have to not acquire businesses that are in your space with these criteria.\u201d That would be a legitimate stance to take, because right now the business model in Silicon Valley is not to try and outcompete the behemoth. It\u2019s just to get bought by them. If you get to a point where they\u2019ll offer you $1 billion and you win, your investors win, you\u2019re rich and then these get folded in, and it doesn\u2019t even matter what they do with your business at that point.\nOver the past five years, 90 percent of A.I. start-ups in Silicon Valley were acquired by major companies, according to TechCrunch.\nBA: You\u2019ve expressed profound distrust of market forces. You just compared the major tech companies to drug dealers, and you want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them?\nI do not want the N.S.A. to outsource national security work to them. I want them to try and fight fire with fire and actually recruit using some of the same methods, and I want the N.S.A. to try and work with them to the extent that they\u2019re realistic, and they know that Google is going to be innovating in ways that the N.S.A. will not be able to do.\nCW: Going back though, my question is, there\u2019s an issue of power here. I mean, sure. You might not want to. You might not be able to address the problems of Facebook if you break it up from Instagram, and I understand that, and there\u2019s still going to be addictive products, but there\u2019s an issue of the consolidation of actual power, the ability to buy those companies, to make those acquisitions. Just simply the leverage that Mark Zuckerberg can use to have a meeting with Donald Trump that they won\u2019t tell us about, I mean, how do you \u2014 if you don\u2019t break them up, how do you get rid of that conglomeration of power?\nNF: I mean, is there still a role for 20th-century antitrust?\nYes. All of this is a prelude to say that, should some of the tech companies be asked to divest parts of their businesses? One hundred percent yes. Like Amazon should not be selling its own house brand to its advantage to other goods. These companies do have excessive power and influence. At this point you could argue they control our democracy.\nSo, and I know The New York Times, I mean you\u2019ve had your issues with Facebook and the rest of it, and they made a change and then all sorts of things happen.\nListening to the tape, we have no idea what this means.\nSo, right now, the government is like this flopping appendage behind a lot of this stuff. I mean, honestly. The Office of Technology Assessment was eliminated in 1995. So our legislature is literally 24 years behind the curve on technology, and they don\u2019t understand. They\u2019re totally outgunned. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\nSo you definitely need to bring the tech companies to heel and say, \u201cLook, here are the list of problems we\u2019re concerned about.\u201d But the solution to the abuse of power is not to say like, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just going to try and keep anyone in the country from having the ability to do wrong.\u201d What you have to do is you have to figure out what the abuses you\u2019re concerned about are, and then actually address them directly.\nCW: Who else besides you that you\u2019re running against understands the internet?\nI haven\u2019t hung out with enough of them to know, but I\u2019m confident I understand the internet better than the [cross talk]\u2014\u2014\nCW: What\u2019s your gut feeling? Who gets it?\nI\u2019m going to say I do not have confidence that any of my opponents get the internet.\nKK: We\u2019re running out of time. So I\u2019m actually going to \u2014 Jesse has one last question.\nOne area we had hoped to ask about but ran out of time was climate solutions, specifically diving deep on his plans for nuclear energy.\nJesse Wegman: I wanted to ask you \u2014 I was looking at the pin on your lapel, \u201cMATH,\u201d and I just wanted you to sort of get down to nuts and bolts a little with regard to what you\u2019re trying to do here. What\u2019s your math to winning the \u2014\u2014\nThe slogan stands for \u201cMake America Think Harder.\u201d\nTo victory?\nKK: Can we add to that? What do you attribute your fund-raising to from last month? Taking in $750,000 in 24 hours.\nWell, we put up a goal on the website, and my supporters do not like to miss goals. And so we just had an aggressive goal, and we were $750,000 short in the last day. So then we raised $750,000 in that day and then we made the goal. So it turns out having goals is very positive for human beings, and our campaign\u2019s continuing to grow by leaps and bounds. That\u2019s one reason why we\u2019re going to shock the world when the voting starts in February.\nMr. Yang surprised the Democratic field with a 257 percent fund-raising surge in October.\nKK: So walk us through Jesse\u2019s \u2014\u2014\nJW: So you\u2019re polling in the low single digits now. What\u2019s the math to get you into the top tier and through the first primary states?\nSure. So if you look at the numbers, you\u2019ve seen the same things that we see. You have four front-runners, but the support is very, very soft. Most people are saying they could change their mind. And there are a lot of people that say they still have not made up their mind. Then you have my campaign, which is growing organically. We\u2019ve grown by, essentially, a percent a month over the last period. And that\u2019s without the benefit of any paid messaging or advertising.\nWe started advertising approximately three weeks ago. The lag time before advertising actually starts showing up in the polls is between three and six weeks. So you are likely to see our poll numbers rise. And more and more Americans are tuning in right now. We\u2019re going to grow and grow and peak at the right time. We think we can do well, particularly, in New Hampshire, upcoming, because it\u2019s an open primary and my campaign has a very strong appeal to independents, Libertarians and many, many disaffected Trump voters. I spoke to half a dozen Trump voters at my events in New Hampshire yesterday and they said that they are crossing party lines to support me.\nJW: Do you support ranked choice voting?\nYes. I have all these democracy reforms. So ranked choice voting, make Election Day a holiday, have vote by mail. I would lower the voting age to 16. Make every high school in the country a hotbed of political activity. Sixteen-year-olds can pay taxes, and they\u2019re going to be on this planet longer. They should have a say in where their taxes go.\nMr. Yang is the first presidential candidate to support lowering the voting age to 16. A recent poll found that 84 percent of Americans oppose the idea.\nKK: Michelle, do you have a \u2014\u2014\nMC: You\u2019ve got a week to make the next debate.\nI might have made it while we\u2019re sitting here.\nMC: It\u2019s true. I have not checked my phone. But if you don\u2019t, how do you work around this? Do you have a plan B? What do you do?\nI expect we\u2019re going to make the debate, but we\u2019ve been growing independent of the debate, I\u2019m happy to say. And for better or for worse, the influence of the debates seems to be waning along with the viewership. So we\u2019re going to be here the whole way, regardless. Our support base is independent of those appearances. But we\u2019re going to make the debate. I\u2019m going to continue to make my case to the American people. You\u2019re going to see us grow and grow, and peak at exactly Feb. 3.\nMr. Yang\u2019s support has indeed been growing in Iowa in recent months, with some polls finding him ahead of Pete Buttigieg.\nKK: For our last about minute, Brent, do you want to \u2014\u2014\nBS: What are you likely to fail at as president?\nI will fail at many things, I\u2019m sure. Keep in mind, I am married. So I understand my daily failures.\nBS: Your failing.\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned, even as a candidate, that I\u2019ve struggled with, truthfully, is that an entire organization hinges upon your day-to-day decisions or movements. And I know as president that will be amplified to a very, very high level.\nI like being a relatively normal citizen. I like being able to go to places and find things out and have normal conversations. I think that\u2019s going to be a real challenge for me because I\u2019ve seen, even now, people are more likely to tell you positive things or things you want to hear than the bad stuff. And so I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge for me to understand what\u2019s happening behind the smiling faces and the people that work for me and my administration.\nIt\u2019s going to be hard for me to get out to the American people because anytime you go out, you\u2019re going to be surrounded by a phalanx of press and staff and the rest of it. So I need to find ways to overcome that challenge.\nI\u2019m feeling it even now, because I am a layperson who decided to run for president, currently fifth in the polls, and that there\u2019ve been many transitions on a personal level. I think one of my primary qualifications to be president of the United States is that I actually do not socialize very easily. By that, what I mean is, I don\u2019t take myself that seriously. I don\u2019t stand on ceremony. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m better than anyone. And I think that\u2019s the kind of leader we need right now.\nBS: You\u2019ve made clear, at least in your early comments, that it\u2019s of primary importance for you to defeat Trump.\nYes.\nBS: At some point, you may decide that your chances of becoming nominee are diminishing. What could you do, outside of being a nominee, to help defeat Trump?\nThere are many of the candidates that I\u2019ve built a rapport with, I would be thrilled to campaign for. I believe I can help make sure that Donald Trump is a one-term president. Best as the nominee, but as someone campaigning for the nominee, I believe I could be very helpful there, too.\nKK: Would you support any Democratic candidate who ultimately won the nomination?\nYes, I would.\nKK: All right. Thank you very much for your time.\nThis interview was conducted Dec. 4, 2019, and published Jan. 15, 2020.

Mr. Buttigieg projected steadiness and thoroughness as he faced questions [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] about his consulting work at McKinsey & Company, his service in Afghanistan, his faith and his challenges in attracting support from minorities and younger voters, despite being the youngest candidate in the contest. He bristled at suggestions that his McKinsey work involved bread price fixing in Canada and claimed ignorance of the \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes popular on the internet among millennials.

So, we have heard you obviously talk about health care and climate and the Middle East a lot in the debates, so we\u2019re going to try to ask you some questions we haven\u2019t heard you answer in the past, and you will be shocked to hear that we\u2019d like to start with your time at McKinsey. You graduated from Oxford with sterling credentials. You could have pursued any number of career paths from there, including the choice you ultimately made to join the military. Can you walk us through why you decided to go to McKinsey from there?\nThe week of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s interview, he had just released his client list from his tenure at McKinsey. When he began his mayoral campaign in South Bend, he leaned heavily on his McKinsey credentials. In a campaign speech, he said: \u201cI am the only candidate with experience working on billion-dollar decisions, helping to turn around major companies around the country and around the world.\u201d\nYeah, so the biggest thing was that I had a great academic education, but I was beginning to feel that there wasn\u2019t as much real-world experience mixed in with it. That in particular, I was eager to do as many things as I could, touching as many fields as I could, and to understand business in particular, about how people and money and goods move around the world and how that works.\nKK: So you didn\u2019t just want to make a lot of money?\nA typical starting salary for analysts at McKinsey is now roughly $85,000 before annual bonuses.\nWhat\u2019s that?\nKK: You didn\u2019t just want to make a lot of money?\nI definitely noticed the paycheck and that was important, too. I needed to make a living. Yeah. I\u2019m not going to pretend that that wasn\u2019t on my mind, too.\nMr. Buttigieg said he lived off his savings from McKinsey during his first two runs for office.\nBinyamin Appelbaum: We\u2019d like to talk about some of those real-world experiences. So one of the companies you worked for, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, you said that you were analyzing costs there, and after you completed that project, the company moved ahead with hundreds of layoffs and rate increases. Did you understand that what you were doing as a McKinsey consultant at that company that you were working to prepare for layoffs and price increases?\nBlue Cross Blue Shield was Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s first assignment at McKinsey. He worked there for three months in 2007. After he left, the company cut as many as 1,000 jobs, or nearly 10 percent of its work force, according to The Times.\nI had nothing to do with premiums, prices, fees or anything like that. Mostly what my team was looking at was overhead. There\u2019s no way to know the relationship between analysis I did in 2007 and decisions they made in 2009, but certainly our focus was making sure that cost was under control there.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield announced its layoffs in January 2009, after the company reported a loss of about $140 million. The company also announced that it would freeze pay for nonunion workers and cut 25 percent of discretionary spending.\nBA: You surely understood why a company like that would hire McKinsey to come in. Yeah?\nHow do you mean?\nBA: When companies hire consultants, they\u2019re usually trying to reduce their costs, right?\nI think that\u2019s the only cost-cutting study I did out of all my time at McKinsey, so I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s accurate to say that that\u2019s what most consulting work is.\nOne of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s McKinsey clients was the Postal Service, which called in McKinsey to address widening revenue losses. In a 2010 report, McKinsey recommended cost cutting by, among other things, replacing unionized career employees with a \u201cmore flexible\u201d work force. Read the report here.\nBA: So it surprised you when that resulted in layoffs and price increases cases. That didn\u2019t seem like what you would\u2019ve done if you had had that information.\nOver time, Mr. Buttigieg has distanced himself from the work he did at McKinsey. When he was running for Indiana state treasurer in 2010, it was a key part of his campaign pitch.\nI wasn\u2019t following news out of Michigan in 2009, so I found that out since, but yeah, I\u2019m not surprised. I mean, if an organization needs to cut costs, then that can involve layoffs.\nBA: Another of your clients, Loblaws, the grocery chain, has since said that it was involved in the price fixing of bread during the time that you were analyzing grocery prices for them. I\u2019m curious first, just, did you analyze the price of bread for them? Is that part of your agreement?\nIn December 2017, Loblaws admitted to participating in a more than 14-year-long scheme to inflate the price of packaged bread. The revelation came from a Competition Bureau criminal investigation into the country\u2019s bread price-fixing.\nNot in any detail. Basically the way my job worked was, they have about 50,000 items that they sold and I was creating and then crunching a database. What we would do is we would figure out, based on a year\u2019s worth of sales, if they tried to cut a certain percent off their prices across a certain number of hundreds of stores, what would the impact of that be? So, bread was probably one of the U.P.C. codes in there, but I didn\u2019t pay attention to one product over another.\nMr. Buttigieg was tasked with building an analysis that could help the company cut its prices without hurting the bottom line.\nBA: When you were working at McKinsey, did you understand the company\u2019s purpose to be exclusively maximizing its own profitability? Did you understand the purpose of the companies you worked for to be exclusively to maximize their profitability?\nWell, many of my clients as, you know, were public sector and nonprofits, so obviously their function is not about profitability. But yes, I worked for a company, a for-profit company.\nTwo-thirds of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s clients at McKinsey were nonprofit or public sector, including the Energy Foundation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Postal Service and the Department of Defense.\nBA: Do you think that that should be the sole mission of a corporation, though, to maximize profitability?\nWell, I think that there\u2019s something to be said for the dialogue that\u2019s happening with, for example, what\u2019s going on in the Business Roundtable, but also this is where policy needs to come in. We can\u2019t expect corporate America to spontaneously change what it is about, without imposing different kinds of left and right boundaries.\nIn August, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization that represents many of the country\u2019s largest companies, issued a statement redefining the purpose of a corporation. In addition to advancing the interests of shareholders, the group said, companies must also protect the environment, invest in employees and commit to ethical engagement with suppliers. Read the statement here.\nTo me, where the public sector and the function of regulation meets what private companies do is precisely to set up those kinds of boundaries. I welcome any time a company undertakes what is called corporate social responsibility, charitable activity or other factors in what they care about. I have been very interested to see the development of things like a B Corps, which has been a big conversation, especially around South Bend actually. Because one of the pioneering ones was a company called Better World Books that grew kind of up and around Notre Dame. But I also don\u2019t think we should be na\u00efve about how corporations behave unless they are regulated to ensure that their profit-seeking activities don\u2019t cause harm.\nB Corporations are companies certified for meeting high social, ethical and environmental standards. Better World Books, an online bookseller, became a founding B Corp in 2007. B Corps are certified by a nonprofit called B Lab. There are now more than 3,000 such businesses.\nKK: In your view, if a company engages in criminal conduct, are the employees responsible for that conduct?\nWell, obviously there\u2019s a whole theory in law about how liability works, but yeah, if somebody undertakes illegal behavior, they are as a general rule liable and should be.\nBA: But bring that down to the practical level then: If you\u2019re working for a consultant to a company that\u2019s engaged in a massive price-fixing scheme, what\u2019s your responsibility?\nWell, if you have anything to do with any wrongdoing, then you\u2019re responsible.\nBA: You have criticized some of McKinsey\u2019s more recent engagements with clients. Do you think that something fundamental has changed about the company since you left?\nIn December, ProPublica and The Times reported that McKinsey consultants had recommended in 2017 that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement cut spending on food and medical care for detained migrants. When asked about the reporting at a campaign event, Mr. Buttigieg said: \u201cThe decision to do what was reported yesterday in The Times is disgusting. And as somebody who left the firm a decade ago, seeing what certain people in that firm have decided to do is extremely frustrating and extremely disappointing.\u201d\nIt\u2019s difficult from the outside looking in to gauge whether this reflects some kind of systemic shift or whether they just have a failure in terms of their guardrails. When I was there, there was a lot of talk about values. Firm values. Now, a lot of that was around impact and making sure that you put the client\u2019s interest first. There\u2019s one story that they were proud of that I remember was part of our training. Where they had gotten some big contract to help a large multinational move into China, and it was going to lead to tons of work. But in the initial analysis, while they were doing their first round of work, the conclusion they reached was that this company shouldn\u2019t go to China at all. So, the story, at least the story as it was told within the firm, was that they gave the right advice, even though it cost them, right? So, you would hear a lot about a certain kind of ethic, but it was always about putting the client\u2019s interest first.\nMcKinsey\u2019s work with Chinese state-owned companies has recently come under fire. The firm has advised at least 22 of the 100 largest state-owned companies in China. Times reporting revealed that one of McKinsey\u2019s Chinese clients helped build China\u2019s artificial islands in the South China Sea. This was after Mr. Buttigieg left the firm. Read The Times report here.\nWhat you didn\u2019t hear as much was about whether what the client was doing had moral consequences that the firm didn\u2019t want to touch. I believe I remember a decision not to serve tobacco had been made by the time I was there. But my point is, there seems to be a problem there with assessing what they want to be associated with. Definitely with the ICE work, with the Saudi work, where you just say, this is a company that\u2019s good at helping clients meet objectives. But some of those objectives are not something we want anything to do with, and I think they need to step back and reassess what kind of client work they should take on in the first place.\nMcKinsey worked with the Saudi Arabian government to analyze public opinion on the monarchy\u2019s most important policies. The firm singled out three people who drove anti-government conversation on Twitter; one was subsequently arrested.\nKK: So you have portrayed a lot of the work that you did for McKinsey, like many analysts and junior staffers starting out in consulting, as mainly crunching data and making PowerPoint presentations and shuffling paper, more or less. Of course, there are also junior consultants and contractors who go to do government work, like Edward Snowden and Reality Winner, who see something that they think is wrong and decide to speak up. Can you tell us your opinion of Mr. Snowden and Ms. Winner\u2019s actions?\nMr. Snowden is a former subcontractor with the National Security Agency who leaked information about the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance activities in 2013. Reality Winner is a former Air Force linguist and intelligence contractor who leaked a government report about Russian hacking. She was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison, the longest sentence ever imposed for leaking government information to the media.\nWell, I think that we ought to have whistle-blower protections so that folks like that are not forced to choose between maintaining classified information and speaking up about wrongdoing. It may well be the case that we\u2019re seeing the whistle-blower concept work in the way in which the current Ukraine process and investigation came about.\nKK: So you think of Edward Snowden as a whistle-blower?\nUnder President Obama, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that Mr. Snowden \u201cis not a whistle-blower\u201d because he did not follow established protocol for releasing confidential information.\nNot necessarily. I think he could have been, if that framework existed. Instead I think of him as somebody who divulged classified information.\nKK: O.K. By some estimates, the federal government\u2019s work force is between 40 and 70 percent made up of contractors. What do you think of that ratio? What should it be ideally?\nA 2017 report from New York University professor Paul Light estimated that four out of every 10 people who work for the U.S. government are private contractors, about 3.7 million people.\nI think it\u2019d be arbitrary to just say there\u2019s some number that should be contractors. What I think we need to do, across our economy, and in some ways the federal government reflects this, is remove some of the magic between being an employee and being a contractor. So I think the biggest example we\u2019re seeing of this in the new economy is, of course, with the gig economy, right?\nThe Times editorial board has condemned the labor practices of companies like Google that rely heavily on contractors because they do not have to offer their contractors the same benefits afforded full-time workers. Read the editorial here.\nThis idea that you can drive for Uber and somehow not be a worker because you are contractor. A lot of this is about getting around labor standards. A lot of this is about cost-saving. Now, if we had a benefit structure in this country that was not only portable but also prorated, then we would be able to remove some of the magic that creates an incentive to have people be contractors rather than employees, and some of the incentives to be a part-time employer versus a full-time employer as well, for people who are employees on the books.\nIn September, California\u2019s State Assembly passed a bill narrowing the definition of who can be classified as a contractor rather than employee. Uber responded by saying its drivers are contractors because transportation isn\u2019t the company\u2019s primary business. Read the Times editorial \u201cTake That \u2018Gig\u2019 and Shove It,\u201d here.\nThere will always be times, certainly in my administration, there\u2019ve been times when I\u2019ve turned, in particular, to law firms to supplement the work that our in-house legal team could do and other consultants with specialized expertise or some area where it just made more sense. Of course that\u2019s the case in the federal government too. But if it\u2019s just a way to get around the obligations of having an employee, then I think it needs to be reassessed and the more that can be brought in house, the better. I guess what I\u2019m saying is we can make some changes in our economy and our benefits systems that would reduce some of the pressure to do that in the first place.\nKK: This is just a yes or no question, but would you advise a senior at Harvard today to go to work at McKinsey?\nDepends on the senior. I mean I get questions from people who are thinking about joining the military, as well as consulting companies, as well as political campaigns. I\u2019ll tell you when I was a senior at Harvard, they came around then, too. The standard that I had for myself was, your early 20s are such a precious time that you should prioritize what you\u2019re going to get out of your experience, way more than anything a paycheck can offer you in your early 20s and, for me, it didn\u2019t meet that standard when I was leaving college.\nDirectly out of college, in 2005, Mr. Buttigieg went to Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship.\nKK: O.K. We\u2019re going to pivot to a new topic if you don\u2019t mind.\nMara Gay: Mr. Mayor, can you explain the mistakes that were made around your Douglass Plan? Why did your campaign falsely claim support from black leaders and then use tokenizing stock photos? Can you just talk about how that happened?\nIn July, the Buttigieg campaign released \u201cThe Douglass Plan: A Comprehensive Investment in the Empowerment of Black America.\u201d The campaign released a list of 400 South Carolinians who supported the plan but faced blowback when some said the campaign was intentionally vague about whether they were endorsing the plan or the mayor\u2019s candidacy. The plan was also criticized for featuring a stock photo of a Kenyan woman, who later reached out to The Intercept to voice confusion about her inclusion. Read the Intercept\u2019s reporting on this here.\nMy understanding is that no false statement has ever been made about somebody\u2019s support for the plan. My understanding is that there were miscommunications about the public rollout of people\u2019s names, all of whom had indicated at some point support for the plan, but not all of whom had reconfirmed that they were up for \u2014\u2014\nThe Buttigieg campaign said it sent the plan to a list of South Carolinians and told them they could opt out if they didn\u2019t want to appear on the supporter list. Johnnie Cordero, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party\u2019s Black Caucus, was listed as a supporter, but his name no longer appears on it and he said he did not endorse the Douglass Plan nor Mr. Buttigieg.\nMG: Right. They called it misleading.\n\u2014\u2014 having their names attached to that. So that was a process mistake, obviously, that led to changes in how we communicate with supporters and people that we\u2019re in dialogue with about our policies. I don\u2019t know as much about the stock photo. I think it was on the website until September. I know that the vendor who was involved in running that part of the website or adding that kind of imagery has not been with the campaign for a while and obviously that was a mistake.\nThe stock photo was removed from the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s website in September.\nMG: How can you win the Democratic nomination, let alone the presidency, without the support of black voters? What do you make of the lack of support for your campaign from that community so far?\nBlack voters will make up about 25 percent of voters in the Democratic primaries, according to FiveThirtyEight and NBC. They will be a majority in Alabama and Mississippi. A recent Economist/YouGov survey put Mr. Buttigieg at 2 percent among black voters.\nWell, I believe, first of all, that we\u2019re earning support from black voters. I became mayor and was re-elected as mayor, largely because of support from every constituency, including the black community in my city. I believe that it is \u2014\u2014\nPolitico analyzed data from the 2011 and 2015 mayoral elections in South Bend and found that Mr. Buttigieg won the city\u2019s predominantly black neighborhoods, but he lagged when facing black primary challengers. Read the analysis here.\nBrent Staples: What\u2019s the percentage of black citizenship there?\nAbout 25 percent. I carried every district, including the minority-majority districts in our city, in primaries and generals, both times. I believe that anyone who proposes to be the president ought to be a president for everybody and also in particular, given what African-Americans are up against in the United States today, that the message of the Democratic Party needs to be one that speaks to black voters where they are. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re being very intentional about that.\nCensus data indicates that about a quarter of South Bend\u2019s population is black. Politico\u2019s analysis found that Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s support from the black community declined between his first and second runs for mayor.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to plunge in on polling numbers, but the last couple of rounds that came back suggested that the way that I\u2019m viewed among black voters is roughly the same in terms of the proportions as among white voters. But far more black voters say they don\u2019t know me or don\u2019t have an opinion. I think part of this reflects the fact, certainly something I hear from a lot of black voters, that folks feel not only abused by the Republican Party but often taken for granted by the Democratic Party. So the trust that you can build through quantity of time, through longevity, is very important. I don\u2019t have the kind of longevity that obviously some of my competitors \u2014\u2014\nMG: So how do you overcome that?\nSo two things. First of all, the substance of what we have to offer. I\u2019m really proud of what\u2019s in the Douglass Plan. It\u2019s praised as the most comprehensive plan on dealing with systemic inequality put forward by a presidential candidate. Not, of course, because I sat in a room and thought up all these brilliant ideas, but because we had a lot of conversation and a lot of dialogue and fit our values to a plan to move forward. The more I communicate that plan, the better received it is and the better received I am.\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s Douglass Plan, named for the abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, aims to reduce the country\u2019s prison population by 50 percent, address maternal mortality in the black community and increase funding for historically black colleges and universities among many other aims.\nBut I also think before a lot of folks care what\u2019s in your plan, they need to know what\u2019s in your heart. And I\u2019m working in not just traditional campaign formats \u2014 big speeches and TV appearances \u2014 but also we\u2019ve been doing more and more quiet and smaller engagements.\nOur recent tour to the South, for example, had a lot of conversations that were between 20 and 50 people. Some of them very targeted around a policy issue like health equity or minority entrepreneurship. Some of it more about making sure that I was speaking to and hearing from folks who had been overlooked. So when we were in South Carolina, for example, we were with an almost all-black Democratic group in Allendale County. This is early presidential primary state, right? They hadn\u2019t seen a presidential candidate in more than a decade, and you could feel the extent to which they felt overlooked. Those kinds of engagements I think are very important, too. It\u2019s not just about obviously, our goal to win, it\u2019s about deserving to win. I think that kind of dialogue coupled with all of the things that you do in traditional campaigning is really important right now.\nMG: Your plans for tackling income inequality are not quite as detailed as some of the other candidates\u2019. For example, your policies on an inclusive economy say somewhat vaguely that you\u2019re going to knock down unfair barriers to entrepreneurship. What would that look like?\nA key feature of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s plan for an inclusive economy is his Walker-Lewis Initiative, which aims to triple the number of entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities in the next decade.\nSure. So first of all, we know that there are challenges to access to credit. In fact, virtually every small African-American-owned business that I\u2019ve visited in this campaign, I ask, how\u2019d you get started? How\u2019d you get your start-up money? They always say they had to come up with the cash. That\u2019s a pattern of course that\u2019s borne out on everything from how mom-and-pop businesses experience commercial banking to the well-documented fact of V.C. [venture capital] money, almost all going to a small handful of people and kinds of people in a certain number of places.\nBlack families on average have one-tenth the wealth of white families; a key factor is that black, Hispanic and young people are more likely to be denied credit.\nSo there are things we can do about that. One thing we can do is capitalize CDFIs better \u2014 Community Development Financial Institutions \u2014 that have a much better track record of in turn supporting minority entrepreneurship. The way I would do it would be a 5X C.R.A. super credit for any of the larger institutions to flow funds into CDFIs.\nCommunity Development Financial Institutions are private institutions created to provide financial services in underserved communities, particularly low-income people. They include Community Development Banks, Community Development Credit Unions, Community Development Loan Funds and Community Development Venture Capital Funds.\nAnother thing we can do is direct co-investment \u2014 this is part of our Walker-Lewis Initiative \u2014 in businesses led by those who are underrepresented. There\u2019s precedent for this with TEDCO in Maryland, and I think that kind of co-investment could be very powerful. We\u2019ve seen it in other countries \u2014 you actually see it in the Israeli start-up community with state-supported grants.\nPart of it is looking at other things that need to be reformed in credit scoring and credit systems generally, and then part of it is a little deeper in the chain of cause and effect, right? Where we know how much of the wealth in this country is inherited, not just among the ultrawealthy but just in general.\nKK: Sure.\nAnd how that flows through the implications for homeownership and access to education and health and all the other things that become barriers to folks being able to be empowered economically as they grow up.\nKK: Who do you consider to be your most important advisers within the African-American communities, but also communities of color in general?\nWell, first of all, our campaign team, we were about \u2014 overall, I think we\u2019re about 40 percent people of color.\nAt an N.A.A.C.P. forum in Detroit last summer, Mr. Buttigieg was questioned on the inadequate racial diversity of his \u201ctop-tier staff\u201d on the campaign. The Intercept reported that of nine top city department heads in South Bend, seven are white. Of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s six executive staff members in South Bend just two were nonwhite.\nI will turn to anybody from the local organizer in a given county that we\u2019re traveling to in South Carolina to senior figures like Brandon Neal, our senior adviser on the campaign who\u2019s got a great track record from the Obama White House and the N.A.A.C.P. Or folks like our national investment chair, Swati Mylavarapu, who can speak a lot to some of those capital-formation issues. We try to make sure that I\u2019m listening to everybody I can learn from. I don\u2019t always start by getting permission for whether I can name check them, but a lot of conversation going on.\nBrandon Neal previously served as the national political director at the Democratic National Committee. He also worked for the N.A.A.C.P. and the 2008 Obama campaign. Swati Mylavarapu is a former Silicon Valley tech executive and investor.\nMG: Sorry. Just real quick, have you been to the museum in Montgomery?\nMs. Gay is referring to the Equal Justice Initiative\u2019s Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, sites dedicated to victims of white supremacy and especially lynching. Mr. Staples wrote an editorial observer on the museum and memorial here, and Mr. Wegman wrote one here.\nI have. Yeah. Very recently, and it is haunting because it evokes things that I\u2019ve seen in places like Cambodia, and it\u2019s on American soil. The way they\u2019ve constructed it is, I think, it forces you to understand the relationship between past, present and future. That\u2019s, of course, all the brilliant work that Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative are doing. The fact that it arose out of activism on the death penalty, for example, in Alabama, a state that does not offer counsel past trial and, I think, maybe first appeal for the indigent even on death row, shows you that this is not just about marking something that happened. This is about connecting all of the patterns of injustice and surfacing the violent nature of that injustice in a way that forces us to contend with how it\u2019s all connected.\nMr. Stevenson, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, was inspired to push for the creation of the memorial by criminal justice reform work he was doing in Alabama. The museum has an exhibit about Anthony Ray Hinton, who was wrongfully convicted by an all-white jury and spent 28 years on death row.\nBS: The death penalty as we know it evolved out of lynching.\nYes, as we know it, for sure. Which is, by the way, part of why I\u2019m calling for a constitutional amendment to end the death penalty. Anyway, it was a very powerful experience, and I think it\u2019s very important for us to view not as an antiquarian kind of thing, but as a touchstone for what we\u2019ve got to deal with right now.\nThis is included in Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s Douglass Plan.\nMG: Thanks.\nAisha Harris: Mr. Mayor, you recently said that the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump. Where does Obama fit into all of that? Because he was in office for eight years. I know you were misquoted at one point on that part.\nAt a rally in November, Mr. Buttigieg said: \u201cI think the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump. I am much more interested in building a future that is going to have a lot of differences.\u201d The L.A. Times initially wrongly quoted him as saying \u201cthe failures of the Obama era.\u201d\nYou noticed.\nAH: Yes, but Obama was in office for eight years. So where does he fit into the old normal as you see it?\nWell, first of all, let\u2019s acknowledge that under President Obama, the Great Depression was avoided. Osama bin Laden was brought to justice. Health care was extended to millions of Americans. The auto industry was, was rescued in our country, is pretty good for eight years work. I also think that \u2014\u2014\nBS: That\u2019s the other thing that \u2014 sorry to interrupt you. The other thing to that is the number of racist hate groups kind of quintupled under his leadership. I mean the mere fact of a black person in the White House brought that about.\nIn February 2019, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported that the number of hate groups had grown for the fourth consecutive year. Before that, there were three consecutive years of decline under President Obama.\nWhich is why we can\u2019t treat the Trump phenomenon as a blip or an anomaly. I mean this is surfacing things that \u2014 as in a different way, the arrival of the first African-American president surfaced things that \u2014 of course, had been here all along.\nWe\u2019re going to have to reckon with the extent to which Trump and Trumpism reflect a lot more about America than we might want to admit. Now, he was also, I think, capitalizing on a wave of populism that was responsive to what I would call a 40-year-long Reagan era that President Obama was the last Democratic president serving within. In other words, he was constrained by an atmosphere, a neoliberal consensus, where even for Democrats, most of the time, the only thing you could ever say you were going to do to a tax was cut it. There was this set of constraints that has dominated our political conversation leading to the conflagration that is Trump and Trumpism, and we\u2019ve got to find our way out of it to something new.\nIt is widely argued that the 1970s ushered in a new era of neoliberalism, whose economic and social policies put capitalism and free market competition at its core.\nAH: So how do you plan to sort of dismantle that old regime? Because in part, one of the issues that I think a lot of especially young people have is that you don\u2019t seem nearly as progressive or as revolutionary in some ways as some of the other candidates. That\u2019s something a lot of young people are looking for. So how do you \u2014 can you explain in a little bit more detail how you think about that?\nYeah. Sure. First of all, what I\u2019m proposing would make me the most progressive president in the lifetimes, not only of young people, but I mean, certainly in the last half century. I\u2019ll also say that it matters that we hold together an American majority that is progressive enough that it unlocks possibilities that were not available even 10 years ago during the Obama presidency. So it took everything that the Democratic Party had just to push through a health care reform in the A.C.A., invented by conservatives. Right? And that was a major achievement.\nThe central features of the Affordable Care Act were modeled by Gov. Mitt Romney in Massachusetts and advanced by economists at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. Read the Heritage speech here.\nBut that was as far as you could get during the constraints of that time. Where we are right now is that there is a powerfully large, not everybody obviously, but a powerfully large American majority. Not only to do the right thing on areas where Democrats have generally been trusted \u2014 wages, labor, health \u2014 but also areas where we\u2019ve been on defense, like immigration, guns.\nHolding that majority together is a big part of the task of the next president. I\u2019m not just talking about how to win an election. I\u2019m talking about how to govern this country. We need to have enough clarity of vision that we can see that the boldness of an idea is not measured only by how many people it can alienate, but by what it can get done. So there\u2019s always a more extreme solution on offer that sometimes I\u2019ll be competing with. But I also want to be very clear that what I\u2019m talking about would make the next era \u2014 what I\u2019m proposing we do would make the next era very different from the one we\u2019ve been living.\nAH: Well, one \u2014\u2014\nThat\u2019s my concern is to make that happen.\nAH: So one final question. How do you convey that to younger voters? How do you counter the \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes? Are you familiar?\nThe \u201cMayo Pete\u201d memes feature Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s supporters dancing to Panic! at the Disco\u2019s \u201cHigh Hopes\"; the \u201cmayo\u201d name plays on the idea that, as Mel Magazine explains, Mr. Buttigieg is seen by some as \u201cbland and overwhelmingly white.\u201d\nI\u2019m not. Do I want to know?\nBS: You haven\u2019t heard that expression?\nAH: Well, mayonnaise as I think, and a lot of people think is really, really gross and there have been teens \u2014\u2014\nBS: Wait a minute. [LAUGHTER]\nAH: Let\u2019s not get off track.\nBS: Wait a minute!\nAH: Anyway, people feel strongly about mayo. There have been younger people \u2014 there\u2019s a meme going around called \u201cMayo Pete,\u201d and that I think does speak a little bit to the lack of youth support that you currently hold, even compared to those who are significantly older.\nA New York Times/Siena College poll in November found that young voters ranked Mr. Buttigieg as their third choice, behind Senators Warren and Sanders.\nKK: A more generous interpretation is it\u2019s bland.\nPB: O.K.\nJohn Broder: White.\nSeveral others: And white. [LAUGHTER]\nI get the white part.\nAH: I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you\u2019re gross. [LAUGHTER] That\u2019s not what I meant.\nWell, first of all \u2014 again, try to get folks to look at how big these ideas are. I mean I\u2019m talking to them about the biggest reform in the American health care system we\u2019ve had since Medicare was invented. I\u2019m talking about a game-changing transformation on the availability of funds to go to college. I\u2019m talking about getting our climate carbon neutral by 2050.\nThat will test the limits of human capacity, and there will always be some folks who say, it\u2019s not real. Health care reform isn\u2019t real unless you obliterate the entire private industry. College isn\u2019t real unless even the child of a billionaire can go without paying a penny in tuition. The climate change thing doesn\u2019t count unless it\u2019s trillions more dollars than it is, and that\u2019s just not how I measured the bigness of an idea.\nBA: If I can put this question in a slightly different way, you\u2019ve been on the front lines of corporate downsizing. You\u2019ve been on the front lines of corporate price fixing.\nWhoa, whoa whoa, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s \u2014\u2014\nBA: You\u2019ve been on the front of our misadventures in foreign policy. You\u2019ve had direct experience in many of the things that make a lot of young people very angry about the way that this country is operating right now. You don\u2019t seem to embody that anger.\nIn 2003, Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 then a junior at Harvard \u2014 spoke at an antiwar rally in Cambridge, Mass., protesting the invasion of Iraq. More than a decade later, in 2014, he served seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserves.\nSo the proposition that I\u2019ve been on front lines of corporate price fixing is bullshit. Just to get that out of the way.\nBA: You worked for a company that was fixing bread prices.\nNo, I worked for a consulting company that had a client that may have been involved in fixing or was apparently in a scandal. I was not aware of the Canadian bread pricing scandal until last night.\nMr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign has maintained that he only recently heard of the bread price-fixing scheme and while he was working with Loblaws focused on price cuts more broadly across the grocery store chain.\nBA: Do you feel the anger that many young people feel about the state of \u2014\u2014\nYeah, of course, because it destroyed my city. I grew up surrounded by crumbling factories and empty houses. My city lost 30,000 of its 130,000 people, largely before I was born. So I\u2019m under no illusions about the problems that are present in American capitalism generally and were unleashed beginning with the Reagan era specifically. And while I may not be as emotive sometimes about my sense of anger or frustration or injustice \u2014 and I would argue that some people are given more room to be emotive than others \u2014 I would not be doing any of this if I were not propelled by a level of passion.\nSouth Bend had an unemployment rate of 13 percent in 2010. Under Mayor Buttigieg, it fell to 3.2 percent, though it rose back to 4.3 percent in 2018.\nLook, let\u2019s talk about why I walked away from the private sector in order to go to Indiana to run as a statewide Democratic candidate during the Tea Party wave of 2010 on a platform of defending Barack Obama\u2019s economic policy, knowing that I would in all likelihood get my ass handed to me, which is what happened. But recognizing that the treatment of autoworkers by our incumbent state treasurer in a dispute \u2014 which very few people followed, but really fired me up \u2014 showed everything that was wrong about the way that our politicians, our corporations, our workers and our communities were interacting. And even though I didn\u2019t win, as expected, I also never regretted the fact that even though I spent down all of my savings doing it with an income of, I think, 450 bucks a month from the Navy being what I had during that year.\nMr. Buttigieg ran for Indiana state treasurer in 2010 and lost to Republican Richard Mourdock by nearly 25 percentage points. Mr. Mourdock was a Tea Party Republican.\nKK: So much for those McKinsey dollars, right?\nWell, I spent them all, right? I saved them up, and then I spent them all. This is one of the reasons why I\u2019m, by far, the least wealthy person running for president right now. I guess my point is my decision to take on that fight and subsequently my decision to serve my hometown at the time that it was written off as dying. Having burned through my lavish McKinsey savings and now going into credit card debt was propelled by my acute awareness of the things that are wrong.\nForbes estimates that Mr. Buttigieg is the least wealthy candidate in the 2020 Democratic field.\nBS: When you say you \u2014 just a little aside there, some people are given latitude to be more emotive than others. What are you talking about?\nI just think that \u2014 you are sometimes asked to \u2014\u2014\nBS: You being Pete.\nYeah, sure. I am sometimes asked to be more, I don\u2019t know, have more of a flourish in displaying my emotions, and it is precisely because I feel very strongly about lots of things that I have learned to master how I might feel about anything and channel that into action. Now, I still take great pleasure in firing up a crowd that agrees with me on something I\u2019m passionate about. But I\u2019m also mindful as the new guy that maybe waving my arms is not the best way to convey what I care about.\nJesse Wegman: But who\u2019s given more room to be emotive than you?\nHmm?\nJW: Who is given more room to be emotive than you are?\nOthers. [LAUGHTER]\nNick Fox: Let me get back to Aisha\u2019s question for \u2014\u2014\nMichelle Cottle: You\u2019re looking to distinguish yourself within a sprawling field of candidates. What do you see as real advantages or challenges as being the first openly gay candidate for a major party?\nAs recently as 2007, just 55 percent of voters said they would support a gay or lesbian candidate according to FiveThirtyEight.\nBS: And I have a related question to that, kind of piggy back on it. You\u2019ve talked about your decision not to come out over some period of your life, and I believe we recorded you in a story of saying at some point you thought that coming out would be a political death, a career death sentence. Could you just recap again why you decided to come out when you did, and if you feel you\u2019ve handled that in a way \u2014 what emotional residue is left over from that? You feel you hid too long? Or do you \u2014 what\u2019s the residual of that previous hidden life?\nYou can Read \u201cPete Buttigieg\u2019s Life in the Closet\u201d by Jeremy Peters in The Times here.\nWell, between the time I figured out I was gay and the time I came out, was a period of consciously avoiding love, and that has a certain cost, it has a certain weight. On the other hand, I was also very busy in a very meaningful and very fulfilling job, certainly during my time as mayor. So, I\u2019m not sure I felt the cost as keenly as I would have if I were working 40 hours a week or if I had a job that didn\u2019t give me as much meaning, which I think numbed me a little bit to the effect.\nWhat put me over the edge was the experience of the deployment, where you have that experience where you write the letter, and you put it where your folks can find it if you don\u2019t come back. And I remember writing words that I really meant about how I did not want anyone to think, if my life were short, that I had been cheated because I\u2019d had such a full and wonderful life, even at a young age. But also, knowing that I was preparing for the risk of dying at an age where most of my peers had something I didn\u2019t, which is to know what it was like to be in love. And that was untenable.\nThe Times\u2019s podcast \u201cThe Daily\u201d has an episode focused on Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s decision to come out, featured in its series of interviews with candidates on pivotal moments in their lives. Listen here.\nSo, by the time I came back, I knew I had to do it, but there was the question of how. Right? By then \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was over, so it didn\u2019t mean ending my military career. There was every indication it might mean ending my political career. And I reached the conclusion that I had to take that risk, that was O.K., but also, I had some measure of faith in my community, that at least my current job might be something that I could earn another shot at based on the work I did.\nBut as somebody who lives in Indiana, and needless to say, as somebody who was not computing the possibility of running for president in 2020 when I was going through these personal deliberations in 2015, I recognized that it might constrain, not to say end, a political future I would have in Indiana. As to what it means big picture, I\u2019ll tell you. A couple of things that it means right now, which are very powerful, which is young people letting me know that I\u2019m helping them in some way just by doing this. And not even just young queer people, the really exciting thing \u2014 I\u2019ve shared this story many times on the trail \u2014 was when a teenager let me know that my campaign helped her feel like she had a sense of belonging in her school and her environment even though she had autism. So, that idea of representing difference in a way that validates others.\nMC: This makes you less mayo.\nMaybe. Hopefully it\u2019s at least a better flavor. I don\u2019t know.\nKK: No longer gross.\nBS: Basil mayo.\nI actually hate flavored mayo \u2014 they do this avocado stuff now and it \u2014 because I only use mayo when I\u2019m making tuna salad. [LAUGHTER] And I want it as straightforward as possible.\nBS: That\u2019s a joke?\nPB: No, it\u2019s high-protein. It\u2019s very affordable.\nBS: O.K. I thought you\u2019re making a joke.\nYou can put it on toast. Anyway, where was I? Yeah. Sorry. [LAUGHTER] So, then you have older folks who, and it\u2019s not unusual \u2014 I would say every rope line, well maybe not every rope line, but often, somebody comes up to me, looks at me, starts to try to say something and can\u2019t. They\u2019re usually in their 50s or older, and I know exactly what they\u2019re saying and that\u2019s all it takes. And that is extraordinary.\nIt\u2019s not why I got into this race, but it\u2019s part of what this campaign means, and I\u2019m very mindful of that. I\u2019m also very mindful from a historic perspective that usually when somebody had \u2014 well, we don\u2019t have nearly enough examples, but when somebody\u2019s broken a barrier going into the presidency, it\u2019s usually not been the first person to make the attempt. So, the first woman president will not be the first woman to run for president. The first African-American president was not the first African-American to run for president. So, analytically, I\u2019m conscious of the fact that I seek the presidency, if elected, I\u2019d be the first out gay president, and I\u2019m the first elected official to make the attempt.\nThe first woman to run for president is often credited as Victoria Woodhull, a stockbroker and newspaper publisher who ran in 1872. The first African-American to run for president was George Edwin Taylor in 1904. The son of a slave, Mr. Taylor ran as the candidate of the National Negro Liberty Party.\nMC: Do you feel a burden of representation? A lot of women have talked about whether or not they feel this extra burden when they are representing, or minorities or things like that. I mean, is this something that you contend with?\nWell, I don\u2019t want to sit around thinking about it, but it\u2019s certainly there. Sure, yeah, of course, but so is every \u2014 look, when you put your name on the ballot, and you\u2019ve got organizers who attach their name to yours and drop what they\u2019re doing and skip college to go to Iowa and help you, and people give you their money for your campaign, and some of them tell you that they\u2019re passing up a vacation so that they can contribute to your campaign. You already feel that level of responsibility. Right? So, calling it a burden \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one more reason I\u2019m motivated to make sure that I do the very best to win and to deserve to win.\nMC: Now, have you given thought, and I know it\u2019s early, but if not to specific running mates then to factors of what you\u2019d be looking for? We talked to people about balancing the tickets.\nYeah.\nMC: Things like that.\nSo, first of all, the choice of a running mate is the one choice a candidate makes that is actually a presidential choice. The whole country has to live with it. And so, in a way, retroactively, it\u2019s your first decision as president. And for that reason I think you have to have this deadly serious bar that it\u2019s really about who is best positioned to lead the country in the event that I get killed or I\u2019m unable to serve, and everything else has to follow that.\nHaving said that, whether we\u2019re talking about running mates or whether we\u2019re talking about my vision for how to build out a cabinet, yes, balance is extremely important. Racial balance, gender balance, balance in experience, having a shared worldview but different strengths and weaknesses is important. And so, I\u2019ve made a decision that I should not say anything that would disqualify anybody from being considered, but in addition to balance and diversity and range \u2014 this, by the way, another reason I pledged the 50 percent women minimum cabinet. I\u2019m looking for truth tellers because I\u2019ve always relied on those I\u2019m with and certainly in my administration, also in my campaign, to be there to tell me things I wish weren\u2019t true or would rather not hear. And that quality, I imagine this is especially important in a vice president, not to mention a running mate.\nIn Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s agenda promoting women\u2019s rights, he committed to nominating women to 50 percent of his cabinet positions and judicial seats. He also said he would put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill and create a commission to ensure there are more national monuments for women.\nMC: Now, looking at one more with a campaign, specifically, and it speaks a little bit to the youth questions and whether or not you\u2019re not quite revolutionary enough. Cleaning up the campaign finance system is a big issue for Democrats. They won big on it with the midterms. Are you concerned that your broader approach to campaign donations, not eschewing big corporate donations and things like that, will alienate you from these younger, more idealistic voters who really see money in politics, big money in politics, as a problem?\nAfter the board\u2019s interview with Mr. Buttigieg, he came under fire for a photo that went viral of a fund-raiser held for his campaign at a \u201cwine cave\u201d in California.\nI see money in politics as a problem, but it\u2019s a structural problem requiring a structural fix. I mean, we are getting ready to go into the fight of our lives against Donald Trump and his allies, that last time I checked, put together something like 125 million bucks in the last quarter. Right? And tying a hand behind our back to satisfy a purity test is not going to help us deliver the actual structural change that\u2019s needed. So, I don\u2019t take corporate PAC money because I think it\u2019s important to live that ideal. I also have 700,000, I think, individual contributors, and I obviously don\u2019t know most of them personally. Right? And I imagine they don\u2019t agree with me on everything, they don\u2019t agree with each other on everything, but I certainly believe in grass roots organization building. And the office of mayor of South Bend, Ind., is not generally known as an establishment fund-raising powerhouse. Right? So, we got to where we are with a message and a vision that\u2019s compelling, and my message, whether it\u2019s to young progressives or to moderates or to the future former Republicans I\u2019m finding out there on the trail is, \u201cLook at what we could do as a country.\u201d And if that message is compelling, I have to believe that\u2019s what will decide this election.\nSenators Warren and Sanders are refusing high-dollar private fund-raisers \u2014 which Mr. Buttigieg refers to as a \u201cpurity test.\u201d\nKK: We\u2019re about halfway through our time at this point. We have about four more pages of questions here, so we\u2019re going to turn to another topic.\nLauren Kelley: Mr. Mayor, I wanted to ask you a little bit about reproductive rights. When you\u2019ve talked about your support for abortion rights, you\u2019ve in the past said that you\u2019ve taken cues from the Bible. I\u2019m curious how you connect with both voters and lawmakers who have a very different interpretation from the Bible, that abortion is a sin or even akin to murder, or do you even try to change their minds or reach them?\nIn a radio interview last September, Mr. Buttigieg said the Bible has guided his views on reproductive rights. He said, \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.\u201d\nFirst of all, my interpretation of my religion has no business being imposed on anyone else through policy. So, I\u2019ve occasionally shared my own understanding of the verses beginning with Genesis about the breath of life, that associate the beginning of life with breath, but that is a personal encounter with scripture that is not for anybody else to have to live with from a policy perspective.\nLK: O.K.\nI think that different people reach different good-faith conclusions about when life begins, which is a metaphysical and, in certain ways, unknowable question. Which is exactly why I think the consensus, or at least the decision we\u2019ve got to reach, is not to convince one another to draw the same line in the same place, but to reach a decision, or consensus, about who gets to draw the line. Not where to draw the line, but who should run the line.\nTimes columnist Ross Douthat responded to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s comments on biblical verse and reproductive freedom here.\nLK: So, I appreciate that you take your biblical interpretation out of the policy arena, but that\u2019s certainly not true of the other side. Right?\nTrue. Yeah, yeah. And this is the problem, right? This is the problem with certain versions of how some people want to bring religion into politics, which is not just as a formation of conscience. I think we have an obligation to be transparent about how our conscience is formed, but something that they believe others ought to have to live by. And obviously, as a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, I\u2019ve seen the consequences of other people believing their interpretation of their religion ought to be imposed on me. And we see something similar in the fight against abortion rights.\nJim Dao: Who does get to draw the line? How do you define that?\nWell, in my view, it\u2019s the woman facing the decision. Now, societally, we do have some broad boundaries. You look at the Roe v. Wade framework that has early in pregnancy, very few restrictions, and late in pregnancy, very few exceptions. So, at the broadest level, there\u2019s some societal and legal norms, but we view this, ultimately, as an individual choice. And this is another example of something that most Americans believe. You wouldn\u2019t know it.\nLK: Yeah. Most of Americans believe it, but that framework that you\u2019re talking about, Roe, is being chipped away at.\nIn 2019, a number of states passed laws posing a serious threat to women\u2019s reproductive freedoms, from Alabama\u2019s restrictive abortion bill to Georgia\u2019s so-called heartbeat bill.\nExactly. Yeah, yeah. And it\u2019s being chipped away in a way that is counter \u2014 my point is that it\u2019s counter to what most Americans believe. And it will continue on all fronts, executive, judicial and legislative, which is why I\u2019m determined to make sure my appointments to the judiciary share my understanding of freedom. My executive actions \u2014 some of which can be done right away, think about the Title X gag rule. Right?\nIn \u201cThe G.O.P.\u2019s War on Women\u2019s Health Gets Results,\u201d the editorial board wrote about how the Trump administration has undermined Title X, making it hard for women\u2019s health clinics to stay open. Read the editorial here.\nLK: Sure. Yes.\nUphold the right to choose. But also, that we put more legislative backing behind things like the need to encode Roe, and the need to withdraw things like the Hyde Amendment, that are de facto restrictions that make it impossible to access abortion care for those who are low income.\nJW: Mr. Mayor, speaking of your judicial appointments and cases like Roe v. Wade, can you give us some names of people you\u2019d consider nominating to the Supreme Court?\nSo, again, I think it\u2019s irresponsible for me to name check folks for the future.\nJW: Donald Trump did it.\nPresident Trump put out a list of possible Supreme Court picks in May 2016, and added more names in September. View the list here.\nAnd he is not my role model on things like this.\nJW: But it helped him.\nI\u2019m sure it did. Lots of things he did helped him that I will not be emulating. I can tell you that there are justices, I mean folks like \u2014 you can look at the jurisprudence of somebody like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you can look at the historic contributions of figures like Thurgood Marshall, and get some sense of what would guide my philosophy, in particular \u2014\u2014\nJW: What about their jurisprudence?\nWell, first of all and understanding, most importantly, an understanding of freedom that includes not just the \u201cfreedom from\u201d that is, I think, the only side of freedom that some of our conservative friends are able to see, but also \u201cfreedom to\u201d live a life of your choosing and the fact that makes a claim. And understanding the importance of our proactive positive freedoms, from abortion rights to voting rights, and what that means for our ability to thrive and to live lives of our choosing and to function as a country.\nKK: Can you talk a little bit about your plan, the 15-member Supreme Court plan that you\u2019ve proposed?\nDuring the October presidential debate, Mr. Buttigieg defended court-packing \u2014 adding additional justices, five appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10 \u2014 as a way to limit partisan control over the court. He suggested term limits for justices as an alternative.\nYeah. So, again, I do not want to claim credit for having invented this, but it was published in the Yale Law Journal, I think in the current edition, as part of an article contemplating options for structural reform that go beyond the debate about court packing. I\u2019m not talking about changing the court in order to make it more liberal. My appointments will make it more liberal, at least by the likes of the way these debates are tracked.\nRead Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman\u2019s \u201cHow to Save the Supreme Court.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m talking about a structural reform to change the political stakes of judicial appointments. And the one you\u2019re mentioning that I think deserves to be considered is called a balanced bench. And the idea is you have 15 justices overall, 10 of them arrive in the traditional, you might say, partisan process that we\u2019re used to. The other five can only be seated by a unanimous agreement of the other 10. And the idea is that there will be a depoliticization of those choices. And it might be on a rotating basis. I think the authors in the Yale Law Journal suggest that they be rotated up from the appellate bench. That gets you away from these strange phenomena like the Kennedy brief, where a whole body of casework is done to appeal to the idiosyncrasies of a single perceived swing justice.\nBut more important, to make sure that every vacancy doesn\u2019t turn into another apocalyptic ideological firefight. A different version that is also contemplated in that article would be to make the entire court rotated on and off the appellate bench. Very interesting debate over whether that would even require constitutional reform or whether you could do it by law. By the way, even though this is admittedly bold, it is far from unprecedented for there to be changes to the size and makeup of the court. It\u2019s happened in a substantial way about half a dozen times. I would argue the Republicans changed the size of the Supreme Court to eight until they took power again, very recently. But in terms of actual formal changes, we\u2019ve seen that about half a dozen times.\nMerrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2016 but was blocked by Republican opposition.\nJW: And another major structural reform that you supported earlier in your campaign was the abolishment of the Electoral College in favor of the national popular vote. You talked about it a lot early on. You haven\u2019t talked about it for a while.\nRead the editorial board\u2019s stance in \u201cFix the Electoral College \u2014 Or Scrap It.\u201d\nSo, that\u2019s false, and I reject any reporting, some of which I\u2019ve seen, I believe some of it coming from this building, that suggests that I backed away from it. I talk about it in virtually every stump speech that I give, and it is, by the way, kind of a tough sell in places like New Hampshire, but I want to make sure that people in New Hampshire hear something that\u2019s not that different from what I have to say when I\u2019m in Manhattan.\nIn December, The Washington Post reported that Mr. Buttigieg was shifting increasingly to the center. The article opens by stating that he began his campaign speaking urgently about reforms needed like the elimination of the Electoral College.\nIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m under any illusions can be delivered in probably one presidential term, but it\u2019s precisely because I think it will take a long time to deliver this, and it may have to be delivered on a delayed-action basis, so it\u2019s harder to know who benefits in the short term, that I think we ought to be making the case for it right now. I mean, first of all, it connects to just the idea of democracy, right? Not the technicality, the system of democracy, but the value that it matters, that we\u2019re a country where the people decide where we\u2019re headed.\nSecond, I remember as a student learning about this, you know, as a high schooler, thinking, \u201cWell, surely the first time it ever actually overrules the American people, America will get rid of it.\u201d That\u2019s now happened twice.\nIt doesn\u2019t even privilege small states. One of the principled arguments for it would be the small states get overlooked, but it doesn\u2019t, it just privileges some states. Right? Small states like Rhode Island get ignored or Wyoming, and big states like Texas or New York get ignored.\nPlus, our well-being has been impacted by the Electoral College far more in terms of the outcome over the course of this nation than the number of presidential campaign rallies held close to where I live.\nAnd so, it\u2019s one of these issues where if there was any principled justification left for the Electoral College, it was the idea that if the American people somehow elected somebody manifestly unfit for the office that there would be some safety valve on that, and instead, the reverse happened. I didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. I just get frustrated when it is implied that I talk about this less today than I did six months ago.\nKK: All right.\nCharlie Warzel: If I could pivot to technology and your tech policy. You\u2019ve spoken, and I believe you told Vox recently, that breaking up Big Tech should be an option. It seems like your proposal is somewhat more vague than some of your opponents\u2019. One of the things you mentioned was doubling antitrust enforcement budgets. Can you tell me a little bit about how you plan to go about evaluating whether breaking up should happen? For Facebook, for example, do you think Facebook should be broken up right now?\nMr. Buttigieg was somewhat vague in his response to Vox on whether Big Tech should be broken up. He said, \u201cWe will rigorously enforce the law, and if they continue the behavior, breaking up tech companies should be an option.\u201d\nYeah. So, I think there\u2019s a strong case for that. The reason I don\u2019t think it makes sense for me to say as a candidate, \u201cThis company shall be broken up,\u201d is the same reason I wouldn\u2019t generally say of the outcome of a trial in a judicial process. This \u2014\u2014\nCW: But you can think about their power, right? Right now, as you see the influence that they have in modern politics \u2014\u2014\nAbsolutely. Yeah.\nCW: \u2014\u2014 and say, \u201cThis needs to change.\u201d\nYes. And that\u2019s the problem with Facebook. No one company and no one person should have the kind of power that they\u2019ve accumulated.\nNow, under our existing framework, it was designed to handle monopolies mostly in terms of pricing power. Pricing power is not the biggest worry around the harms that the scope and power of Facebook and other large tech companies have accumulated is, right? The way I would think about it is to, first of all, break out certain things that I think are conflated in the frustrations and anger directed toward big companies.\nOne set of issues has to do with data security and data privacy. That requires a national data law and stronger privacy and security protections, but frankly, dealing with the monopoly problem is neither necessary nor sufficient to fix that. In other words, that\u2019s a stand-alone set of issues that has to happen, because a small company could misbehave with data, too.\nMr. Buttigieg has said he would work with Congress to pass a federal privacy bill and double funding for antitrust enforcement.\nThen we got the monopoly concern, and to put a little more meat on some of what you mentioned, one of the things I think we\u2019re going to need is a standard that shifts the burden to large companies, especially when they\u2019re making acquisitions, like the acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook, that are likely anti-competitive.\nCW: If that was happening during your administration, theoretically, you would have vocally supported blocking that?\nYeah. Again, the president doesn\u2019t sit there and direct how an administrative process is going to come out, but yes, there needs to be a prior review. At a certain level, instead of the burden being on the state to demonstrate that some of these mergers will be harmful, I think the burden should be on the company to demonstrate that they won\u2019t.\nCW: O.K. What do you make of your support from Silicon Valley? I mean, the idea that maybe they\u2019re not adequately afraid of you?\nKK: Can you also speak to your relationship with Mark Zuckerberg?\nIn October, Bloomberg News reported that Mr. Zuckerberg advised Mr. Buttigieg on his tech campaign hires.\nYeah. So, we were in college at the same time, got a lot of mutual friends, and it doesn\u2019t mean we agree on a lot of things. So, I\u2019m sure he would vigorously disagree with my assessment of the WhatsApp acquisition, for example.\nCW: Do you think he holds too much power right now?\nYes. No one should have that kind of power. Now, part of the problem is that a social network is a natural monopoly, right? So, if we were just talking about the, what you might call the Facebook part of Facebook, the product that people are most familiar with, if you broke that up, you just wind up with two of them and one of them would die and one of them would be the new one. The real problem is how a corporation of that size acquires other competitors and develops certain powers. And then, there\u2019s a problem of their refusal to accept their responsibility for speech that they make money from. So, if a cable company, or a newspaper, if somebody can show that an ad that you all were going to run is false, you would pull it, and yet Facebook doesn\u2019t want to hold themselves to that same standard.\nMr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly affirmed that Facebook will not check ads from politicians, even if they contain lies, in the interest of free speech. Read The Times\u2019s analysis here.\nKK: But I want to follow up on Charlie\u2019s question. I mean, is Silicon Valley adequately afraid of you? There are other candidates who have used much more bold, intense, I don\u2019t know \u2014\u2014\nMr. Zuckerberg said, in audio leaked to The Verge, that having Senator Warren as president would \u201csuck\u201d for Facebook.\nYes. And some of them seem to get a lot of support out of Silicon Valley, too, so I don\u2019t know. I think you got a lot of folks there who are maybe a little less ideological, who I\u2019m not going to agree with on everything, but also a lot of folks who, I think, are wrestling with what it is they\u2019ve created. The problem is, it shouldn\u2019t just be left to companies to decide how to solve these problems. There needs to be a policy response. Basically what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve outsourced public policy decisions around the limits of speech and misinformation and the handling and the use of data to the companies, which are so big that when they make a corporate policy decision, in effect, they\u2019re actually making a public policy decision. They do it.\nCW: They\u2019re also just platforms for viral advertisement, too.\nYeah. Right. Which is how they make their money, right? Although, I would say that the nonrevenue vitality of social media is just as problematic as the paid stuff.\nKK: We only have about half an hour left, so I want to turn to foreign policy, but before we do, I wanted to ask you one question which we are asking all of our candidates, which is, who has broken your heart?\nI mean, Boston College. I was 11 years old. We were this close to the National Championship. And they came to South Bend, we were one game away, we had beaten Florida State, become No. 1. There wasn\u2019t a B.C.S. back then, so when you finish the season undefeated, you\u2019re the champion. And they came into our stadium, and they broke my little heart.\nIn 1993, Notre Dame\u2019s football team was undefeated and top ranked until it lost to the Boston College Eagles, 41-39, at home in the final game of the regular season. The rivalry between the schools has come to be known as the Holy War.\nKK: As you mentioned, you\u2019ve talked a lot about your faith. Given your faith, how do you reconcile directing the largest, most powerful military in the world with your Christian obligation to love your neighbor? Or enemy. Excuse me. And your neighbor, but mostly your enemies.\nMr. Buttigieg is Episcopalian and outspoken about his faith. St Augustine is one of his major religious influences.\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest problems of being involved in the military at any level, and I suppose we\u2019re all implicated in this just by belonging to this country. You also have to rationalize, as a citizen, how you participate in a society or a country that sometimes does things that are, even when it\u2019s doing the so-called right thing, from the perspective of law, or the law of war, is still doing something that would not be considered Christian or moral by the lights of any number of different faith traditions. Some people take the approach of punching out completely, right? That\u2019s the Walden approach, I guess. I think you have to accept the reality that you are living and working in a broken world, just as we are all broken and beaten, and try to order your steps in a way that brings greater good than harm.\nLook, when you\u2019re in charge of something important, most of when you earn your paycheck is when you\u2019re making decisions between two courses of action, both of which involve harm. Not just to your objectives, but often to your values, and you have to figure out what the right thing is to do. And that\u2019s true for, I think, any position of executive leadership, but certainly when you\u2019re in charge of a government body or a military unit or the entire country and making those life and death decisions. That\u2019s what you have to weigh. It\u2019s not finding what the perfect answer is. Well, it isn\u2019t a McKinsey puzzle where you might be able to compute the right answer. Moral puzzles are different because they don\u2019t have a correct final answer. They have courses of action, some of which can do more good and some of which can do more harm.\nKK: So, the number of countries that the United States military now has troops in is somewhat astounding. Can you make the case for why we need to have an American presence in, for instance, the African nation of Mali?\nSo, we need to maintain the ability to project force in a way that will protect the homeland and meet our core security and national objectives. What I will also say is that there are a lot of troops deployed around the world right now, pursuant to an A.U.M.F., that was passed to deal with 9/11.\nCongress passed the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (A.U.M.F.) three days after the Sept. 11 attacks. The agreement authorized use of force against those responsible for the attacks.\nI\u2019m not sure about Mali, but I remember in Niger, members of Congress admitting, after troops were killed there, that they didn\u2019t know we had troops there.\nThe deaths of four American soldiers in Niger in October 2017 ignited debate over the A.U.M.F. Many Americans did not realize the U.S. had forces in Niger. Senator Tim Kaine, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the deaths showed that U.S. forces are \u201cin many more countries than Americans have been told.\u201d\nKK: It\u2019s also an antiterrorism operation.\nYeah. Is that under the A.U.M.F.? I\u2019d have to think about how those two strands connected. But the point is, the A.U.M.F. had no sunset, and the scope creep most recently, I think, brought to life by the Afghanistan Papers, but we\u2019ve been looking at it for more than a decade, is one of the reasons why I believe that a future A.U.M.F. should always have a three-year sunset. And let\u2019s have that debate.\nThe Trump administration has opposed putting a sunset clause in an A.U.M.F., on the ground that it will embolden enemies who might see it as a date for withdrawal.\nIf a president, if I or any other president, believe in my judgment from a national security perspective that it\u2019s appropriate to have troops deployed somewhere, I should be able to convince Congress of that. Not to mention the fact that the war powers are supposed to [inaudible 01:02:20] in Congress anyway.\nAnd by the way, this also helps with the fact that Congress has been all too happy, I think, not to get involved in questions like whether the A.U.M.F. that was supposed to deal with 9/11 justifies troops being in Mali or Niger. So, some of these deployments are problematic, and we need a much more crisply defined mission both for the war on terror in general and for future military engagements, even while recognizing that we are going to have a base architecture globally that ensures that we maintain global military superiority, especially as we get into a more and more multipolar world.\nAlex Kingsbury: Since you brought it up, can I ask about the Afghanistan Papers? Were you surprised by their broad conclusions, that the public has been lied to for a great many years about the possibility of success?\nIn December, The Washington Post reported on a confidential trove of government documents that revealed how American government officials hid from the public evidence that the war in Afghanistan couldn\u2019t be won. Read the report here.\nAngered, but honestly, not completely surprised. I remember these debates raging in the time that I was deployed, and you could argue that was very late in the war. In fact, I thought it was the end of the war. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights, and that was years ago. And I even remember they posted one of those inscrutable PowerPoints on the wall of the gym by the treadmills. And I remember staring at it, and the PowerPoint was supposed to hold the lines of effort that constituted the mission as O.E.F. turned into Resolute Support, and just squinting at it and thinking, I know a fair amount about why we thought we were here, and I can\u2019t make sense of this.\nOperation Enduring Freedom was the official government name for the war on terror. Resolute Support is a NATO-led operation to provide training and support for Afghan security forces.\nAK: So if the mission is unclear and civilian casualties are at all-time high now, is the war being waged there a morally defensible war? To go back to what you were talking about before.\nWell, unfortunately I think it\u2019s some of our moral intuitions that keep us chasing after some lofty and possibly impossible outcomes.\nAK: Possibly impossible?\nLet me rephrase. Well, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s impossible. They\u2019re not impossible. It\u2019s not impossible for Afghanistan to become a thriving, prosperous, democratic state, but it is impossible for that to happen quickly. It is impossible for it to happen before the time has come when we need to withdraw our troop presence, which is to say that time has come and it hasn\u2019t happened.\nAK: The Trump administration has been trying to do it for three years now. How would you do it any sort of quicker?\nTrump\u2019s administration is not big on decision making and also not big on multilateral diplomacy. Look, in order to do this, the thing we have going for us is that leaving Afghanistan is possibly the one thing that all of the parties think ought to happen. The U.S. left, the U.S. right, the international community, the Taliban and in the long run the Afghan government all want to see this happen. So the question is when we leave, are we going to leave well or are we going to leave poorly? What leaving well looks like is to make sure that there is some kind of negotiated political settlement that gets us here. Not based on a spontaneous invitation to Camp David, but based on a proper level of engagement with the government, which has been sidelined for most of this from what I can tell. The Afghan government, I mean, the Taliban and regional players that play a hugely important role in that area. I\u2019m thinking about Pakistan in particular.\nA 2018 poll from YouGov found that 61 percent of Americans support a withdrawal from Afghanistan.\nJD: Coming back to the question Katie asked about troop deployments across the world, could you see a scenario in Afghanistan where the United States would keep some level of troops to maintain some level of stability?\nWell, look at what we had in northern Syria, a very minimal, light, specialized presence of intelligence and special ops capability that was able to, while they were there, hold the line. Not by assuming responsibility for stability and prosperity of Syria, but by preventing the worst outcomes and being able to alert the United States command when there were likely to be things that could imperil our troops or the homeland. That kind of thing I think will be part of the pathway out of getting large ground troops there or part of the pathway for moving large ground troops.\nKK: Can I turn to another part of the world?\nYes.\nKK: Assume that for a moment that the Chinese government makes a decision that they\u2019re going to flood the streets with troops in order to crack down on the protests that are happening in Hong Kong. What would you do? How would you respond as president?\nWell, the message would need to go to China, that if they\u2019re going to perpetrate a repeat of Tiananmen, that that will lead to them being isolated in the community of nations, and that the United States will use the tools that we have, including diplomatic and economic and information tools, to make good on that so that they have a strong reason not to do it.\nMr. Buttigieg outlined his foreign policy plans in a June speech at Indiana University\u2019s Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies. He said China should be censured for its human rights record but engaged as a strategic partner on a number of thorny issues including terrorism and climate change.\nKK: That\u2019s beforehand, right? What happens if the troops actually go into the streets and there\u2019s mass killings and democratic protests are being squashed?\nI don\u2019t want to jump into hypotheticals, but I\u2019ll say that this is an example of where U.S. policy should stand on the awareness that our interests and our values are inseparable. That every time the United States has tried to pursue its interest at the expense of its values, sooner or later that\u2019s caught up to us. And so our approach needs to be guided by the understanding that part of what is in the American interest is the fact that we stand up for values that are shared.\nRemember, in a scenario like that or frankly in the scenario we\u2019re seeing right now \u2014 this is not just something happening inside Hong Kong or China and a conversation inside the United States. There is such a thing as a global community, and part of the role of the United States is to mobilize that global community in the defense of beliefs around human rights and representation. That ultimately should also be consistent with the stated Chinese goal of stability, but is consistent with our conviction that stability won\u2019t come through repression.\nBA: China has detained hundreds of thousands of its citizens because they\u2019re Muslim. It\u2019s your judgment that they haven\u2019t yet crossed that red line?\nTimes reporting in November revealed a merciless government-driven crackdown on Muslims in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. Read the report here.\nWhat red line?\nBA: You were saying that if China were to repeat the Tiananmen experience, if China were to cross the line and violate human rights, then it would become necessary to respond. Is it not already necessary?\nOh, it\u2019s necessary to respond. Yeah. What I\u2019m saying is we should have a warning about the consequences of those kinds of violent repression, but yes. Right now we are seeing people rounded up, put into camps in huge numbers, and we are seeing not a peep out of the United States president, even by way of moral support for those whose rights are being trampled there and evidenced, by the way, that that silence was purchased in the course of a trade negotiation that has yet to yield anything to the United States anyway. So there\u2019s no question that we right now should be using the tools that we have, especially as what should be a leading voice in the international community.\nIn December, the House passed a bill, 407-1, requiring the Trump administration to condemn abuse against the Uighurs and call for the closing of China\u2019s detention camps.\nOf course, it\u2019s not possible to do that right now because our own president is fanning the flames of Islamophobia right here in the United States. So it is functionally impossible given how much the use of those diplomatic and moral powers relies not just on policy moves, right? But on language and tone and leadership from the American president, it is functionally impossible to do that so long as this president\u2019s in office.\nSerge Schmemann: Mr. Mayor, may I ask you about immigration? You had mentioned that this will be one of the major challenges of the next president. Are you going to, as president, reverse some of President Trump\u2019s policies, his agreements with third world countries on asylum or not letting asylum seekers await the judgment within the United States? What would you do? What would be your criteria for deportations?\nIn September, the Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration\u2019s new rule making it difficult for most migrants and especially Central Americans to seek asylum in the United States. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s rule, migrants cannot apply for asylum unless they have applied and been denied asylum in a country they pass through on the way to the United States.\nSo when it comes to asylum seekers, first of all, it\u2019s recognized that measures like the family case management program worked. Virtually everybody in that program appeared when they were supposed to and so I would not continue the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy.\nThe Family Case Management Program used case managers to ensure migrants adhered to their legal obligations. It was ended by the Trump administration in 2017. It had high levels of compliance, according to a Department of Homeland Security report.\nAnd we need to recognize in our policies and in our tone the idea that asylum is a right. It\u2019s not doing somebody a favor. At least applying for asylum is recognized as a right. It\u2019s one of many things that need to change quickly by way of administrative action. The thrust of my vision on immigration centers on legislative reform, but upfront we know that there need to be actions to ensure that family separation can\u2019t happen again.\nTo the extent that the government is in the business of housing at all, I believe that should be handled by H.H.S., which is designed around health and not by Customs and Border Protection, which is not set up for that kind of role, and a number of other steps that we\u2019ve got to take right away.\nAs to what you\u2019re saying in terms of the administration\u2019s posture toward the countries whose misery, often, is propelling this wave of migration, it is perfectly self-defeating to threaten to withdraw aid from, for example, the Central American Triangle countries when by far the best way forward to prevent a migration crisis in our interest is to make sure that people are living prosperous or at least minimally can count on safety in their own home countries. Part of which can be supported with American investment. Again, it\u2019s not that we can fix \u2014 speaking about what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s not possible \u2014 it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to fix what\u2019s going on in every country. We should at least be doing our part to help.\nSS: People will continue trying to reach the United States. What would you do as president if tens of thousands of Central Americans showed up at the border?\nWell, we still need to maintain a border. It matters, and crossing the border illegally will be illegal when I\u2019m president, too.\nJD: Mr. Mayor, to follow up on that, some Democrats seem to argue that comprehensive immigration reform could be as politically risky as say Medicare for all.\nYes.\nJD: How great a priority would that sort of comprehensive immigration reform be in your administration?\nIt\u2019s a priority because of the way it\u2019s being used to divide Americans. My biggest priority is to bring the country together. Could it be divisive? Sure. I mean, that\u2019s why this president uses it.\nThe irony is that there is that same majority I was talking about. A powerful American majority, not a consensus, but a majority, to do all of the things we\u2019re talking about. Pathway to citizenship, protections for Dreamers, reforms to the asylum system, reform to the lawful immigration system, like how my dad got here, and moving away from a system and numbers and quotas and caps that are not based on anything currently real. And I think that this administration, if they wanted to, could have passed comprehensive immigration reform and taken credit for the achievement. Unfortunately, this president believes that it is more useful for him to divide us around the failure than it is for him to take credit for the achievement, and so we continue entering our 35th year or so since there\u2019s been meaningful reform.\nIn 1986 President Reagan signed a major immigration reform bill creating a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to America before 1982. There has been little meaningful immigration reform in the past two decades, though in 2012 President Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, for the so-called Dreamers. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s father immigrated from Malta.\nJB: Sorry, go ahead. You were in the middle of your answer.\nI was going to say a lot of these concerns that we have around the border change when we have actually fixed the fundamental problem of the legal framework that we have.\nJB: Can we turn to climate change for a minute?\nYep.\nJB: You\u2019re proposing quite a sweeping reform to the country\u2019s approach to climate change. Yet in the detailed proposal you\u2019ve submitted, there\u2019s not a word about nuclear power, which now provides something like 20 percent of electricity in this country with no carbon at all. Would you phase out the existing plants and stop all research on future nuclear technology?\nOther Democratic contenders, like Andrew Yang, have made nuclear energy a central feature of their climate plans.\nI would not look for new nuclear as part of our power mix. I also don\u2019t think we can afford to be dogmatic about this. As you said, it\u2019s carbon free and by far the biggest threat we face right now is carbon. However, you can\u2019t ignore the waste concerns associated with nuclear power as we know it. Research to develop nuclear possibilities that don\u2019t have those risks or don\u2019t produce that kind of waste, of course we should be pursuing that. As far as the kind of nuclear power that we currently have, the kind of fission power that generates waste, I don\u2019t believe that that is the long-term future when we know so much potential lies in other forms of renewable energy generation that don\u2019t have that set of problems. So yes, it is part of our pathway to carbon neutrality. There\u2019s no question. It\u2019s part of that medium-term mix. When I talk about that medium term, I\u2019m really talking about the existing installed generation base and not adding more.\nThe European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) has devoted significant time and funds to research on thorium, an alternative to uranium as a source of clean energy. Read more from the World Economic Forum here.\nAK: When you phase out the nuclear plants, do you support keeping all the waste at the closed facilities like it is now or building Yucca Mountain to store it safely?\nCongress designated Yucca Mountain as the site for a nuclear waste repository in 1987, but it has never been licensed. If constructed, it would use a complex 1,000 feet below the mountain\u2019s summit.\nSo the problem with the Yucca Mountain is it\u2019s not got the consent of those who would be impacted, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an acceptable solution as long as there is not that kind of consent. There\u2019s been talk about certain kinds of safer on-site or near-site storage than we have today. No solution is perfect, but we certainly need to continue developing safe methods for storage and removal.\nIn March, Nevada\u2019s Democratic representatives unveiled legislation that would prevent the construction of the facility as long as the state, local and tribal communities haven\u2019t given their consent.\nKK: Do you think there\u2019s enough effort to build consensus to build Yucca Mountain at this point? I mean we haven\u2019t even, communities \u2014\u2014\nThere\u2019s been the reverse. There\u2019s been no effort. They\u2019ve completely ignored communities, right?\nAK: But no one\u2019s going to put nuclear waste in their backyard\nKK: Yeah. Exactly. No one\u2019s going to want nuclear waste in their backyard.\nWell, the blue-ribbon commission laid out a framework for some kind of an informed-consent process, and we\u2019ve seen the reverse. Just failing to inform even elected officials about some decisions and some moves. So what we know is consensus may be elusive. The wrong way to get it is what they\u2019ve been doing lately.\nKK: So I hate to cut us off from climate since it\u2019s such a huge issue, but we have only a few minutes left and we have a lot of other things we want to get to. Maybe we can turn to health care for a few minutes and then go back to a couple of economic questions.\nJeneen Interlandi: Do you think that families should be able to obtain religious or personal exemptions for mandatory vaccination?\nNo. We\u2019ve seen the public health impact of, I can\u2019t even call it pseudoscience, but the way that people have been steered off things that are necessary. This is complex. Different states have different frameworks, some of which acknowledge these kinds of exemptions and some of which don\u2019t. I acknowledge that those differences exist among the states, but we have to move forward a world of universal vaccination. And I believe this strongly enough that personally I\u2019ve done what I can just from a public education standpoint, including this somewhat awkward spectacle of inviting news cameras to watch me get my vaccinations at the county health department. Just to try to send that message to remind folks of that responsibility.\nEarlier in his campaign, Mr. Buttigieg said he backed \u201cpersonal belief and religious exemptions\u201d on vaccines, then backtracked and said he only supported medical exemptions.\nJI: Have you thought about what you would do as president to promote that message and to kind of shore up public trust in vaccines? Because it is waning.\nRecent reporting has shown that trust in vaccines has declined in the past decade among American adults.\nYeah, I think that people need to hear that from the president. The president is a messenger on public health and maybe I\u2019ll continue that spectacle, hopefully I\u2019ll have a little more to show up here. [MAYOR POINTS TO BICEP. LAUGHTER] But also in terms of the message we send about the role that this has in parenting and in citizenship and in being part of your community to make sure that the community is safe from communicable disease.\nJI: As president, would you use march-in rights to produce low-cost insulin? So overriding corporate patents on drugs that are overpriced?\nMarch-in rights were created in 1980 under the Bayh-Dole Act. Some argue they could be used to lower the cost of drugs like insulin. They allow a government agency to \u201cmarch in\u201d and circumvent a patent if a therapy isn\u2019t made available to the public within a reasonable time.\nI would view that as a last resort, but I believe it should not be taken off the table.\nJI: Something you would consider.\nIf only because I think knowing that is being held in reserve might be what it takes to get a better result while at the table. So definitely something I would hope never to use, but I would not rule it out.\nJI: I just want to talk a little bit very quickly about the public option, which is what you\u2019ve supported in terms of health care reform. You\u2019ve said yourself a couple of times today that this is still actually a bold vision. It\u2019s kind of sort of gotten framed as weak sauce relative to Medicare for all, but it\u2019s actually still a pretty heavy lift. So can you talk a little bit about how you see getting that through Congress, where there\u2019s going to be a lot of opposition, and what you think it would cost?\nYeah. So the bedrock for this as for many of the other policies I\u2019m talking about that yes, put me certainly further than the Obama administration was able to be, for example, and would be progressive. The great thing about this is they command a support of the American majority. So Medicare for all if you want it has strong support. Often when people tell pollsters they\u2019re for Medicare for all, this is what they mean, right? So there\u2019s issue after issue where what we\u2019ve got to do is manage the daylight between what commands a majority among the American people and what can get a majority in the American Congress.\nPart of that is why we need structural reforms, why we\u2019ve got to do something about things like gerrymandering and other issues that help to explain why Congress is the way it is. But I also believe that a very good use of the president\u2019s time and energy is to be personally present in even conservative states or districts where measures like this have popular support. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fanciful about this because you can just look at the political life of the A.C.A., which again was toxic for Democrats in 2010 when I was getting crushed in my first experience on the ballot in Indiana, and by 2018 was the winning issue for Democrats such that even when the Republicans controlled everything, they could not make good on their central campaign promise, even when they were in charge. Right? So we know that when we restore the center of gravity of politics to the lived experience of Americans who are affected by political decisions and not the noise that this president creates, we have a winning hand to get these policies through.\nIn 2017, Mr. Trump claimed \u201cwe have essentially repealed Obamacare.\u201d In fact, the Affordable Care Act has grown only more popular \u2014 a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in 2018 found the law\u2019s favorability at 54 percent, its highest point since it began surveying people about it in 2010.\nJI: Can you talk a little bit about the cost itself?\nYeah. So we\u2019ve scored it at $1.5 trillion over 10 years. In order to achieve that, actually a fully 1.4 of it can be recouped just from rolling back the corporate tax rate portion of the Trump tax cuts. For the other 0.1, $100 billion, I would account that as part of the savings that we will get from the negotiation of prescription drug prices by Medicare and H.H.S., which I think narrowly that move alone C.B.O. had between $3 billion and $400 billion over a decade. We believe the overall savings to the Treasury of the different moves we aim to make would come to over $600 billion. Anyway, I only need 0.1 to make up the gap between 1.4 and 1.5 [trillion].\nMayor Buttigieg\u2019s campaign said his health care plan, \u201cMedicare for all who want it,\u201d would be almost entirely paid for by rolling Mr. Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts back to 35 percent rates.\nJI: So here\u2019s the thing I kind of want to talk about.\nYeah.\nJI: $1.5 trillion is a lot less than Medicare for all, than Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan would cost, right? But that\u2019s over 10 years. If your plan succeeds and more people choose the public option versus private insurance beyond 10 years, it could become quite expensive. What do you say to arguments that ultimately it would be just as expensive as something like Medicare for all, so why not just do that?\nSenator Warren\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan is estimated to cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade. Read how she did her math in the Upshot.\nWell, the problem with Medicare for all or that version of Medicare for all that my competitors have isn\u2019t just the cost. I certainly believe that when you propose something with a cost, you got to be able to explain how to pay it. And that\u2019s a problem there. It\u2019s also the idea of dictating to people what their choice ought to be.\nYou look at the plans that a lot of folks, including a lot of folks in labor, have fought for, sometimes trading off wages to get them. They\u2019re not interested in being kicked off the plan. I think just baking that little bit of humility into the policy pays off because it also, it\u2019s not just \u2014 sorry \u2014 but it\u2019s not just the problem of dictating that this plan will be better. There\u2019s a comparable danger of policy arrogance in supposing that we can guess from Washington the correct number of years before the transition should happen. So what I\u2019m supporting is a way for the transition to be organic.\nJI: O.K. So just one very quick follow-up to that. With respect to the public option being a better choice and that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s often used to kind of promote the idea. How do you make that work if doctors and hospitals can simply choose not to accept the public option as long as private still exists? How do you address that concern in your thinking?\nSo I believe the economy of scale, especially if you compare it to Medicare, right? The places where Medicare is accepted indicate that as long as a reimbursement is appropriate, that there should not be a problem on the provider side. Now I do think that you can\u2019t just copy-paste what we\u2019re doing with Medicare now because if that were where we needed it to be, we wouldn\u2019t see the problem we have with the loss of \u2014\u2014\nJI: So do you reimburse at a higher or lower rate? Sorry, last one.\nKK: Jeneen!\nOverall reimbursements are likely to have to go higher, not just in the public but in Medicare as we know it, especially in areas that are losing providers like rural areas.\nKK: So we have a couple of questions about your time and your mayorship in South Bend and I want to get to those if you don\u2019t mind. Then we\u2019ll come back to the economic questions.\nNF: If you don\u2019t mind, I wanted to get back to what Aisha was saying. I found your answer to her kind of vague, quite vague, and I thought she was asking something really important. A lot of young people and not so young people are disgusted by growing up in a system in which they\u2019re seeing more and more of the wealth of the country going to a smaller and smaller group of people at the expense of everyone else. That small group of people having an increasing amount of political and economic power. Some of your opponents have had very clear solutions or what they call very clear solutions for those problems. I\u2019m wondering if in that time we have, if you could give specific solutions to say what the government could do to address the growing financial inequities, what the government could do about the power of the financial industry, about the corruption of politics, about the corruption of industry itself?\nOf course. Yeah, I mean, I would argue that the proposals I\u2019ve put forward on dealing with precisely this set of problems is more specific than most of my competitors\u2019. That\u2019s everything from my proposal to double the rate of unionization in this country, to my insistence that we increase the minimum wage to some of the other labor market reforms I\u2019ve proposed around taking care of contractors and gig workers, to campaign-finance reforms up to and including a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United.\nMr. Buttigieg is one of several candidates who have earned the approval of the grass roots group End Citizens United for his commitment to anti-corruption legislation. He defended his intent to use a constitutional amendment to do so, arguing: \u201cDoes anybody really think we\u2019re going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldn\u2019t drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.\u201d\nNot to mention things we could do in the shorter run, ranging from ideas already baked into H.R. 1, around drowning out dark money, to heavier-lift reforms around public financing of campaigns, while we are working the bigger generational fight on things like Citizens United. I believe that we need to be investing in the sources of social mobility and domestic competitiveness to include my proposal that we triple funding for Title I in education, to include everything that\u2019s contemplated in the Douglass Plan, to include what we need to do around infrastructure. And that in order to do that, we must raise taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations. So I am no less determined and no less specific than my competitors about this. What I think might be happening \u2014\u2014\nMr. Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Sanders have all pledged to triple Title I funding for low-income schools, and Senator Warren has pledged to quadruple it.\nNF: What are your questions on raises?\nSorry?\nNF: What are the questions on raising taxes?\nSay again?\nNF: On raising taxes, what are your proposals?\nSo a financial transactions tax, rollback wholesale of the Trump tax cuts with a special focus on what\u2019s going on in the corporate-rate tax cut. Close the 199A loophole, deal with some of the enforcement deficiencies that are driving the big part of the revenue gap right now I think. I\u2019m also open to a wealth tax. I just would not put my signature proposal in a position of being completely dependent on a tax that is constitutionally untested. In principle I think it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just not counting on it.\nIn the December Democratic debate, Mr. Buttigieg criticized Senator Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan as \u201cextreme.\u201d He cautioned that candidates should \u201cbe smart about the promises we\u2019re making, make sure they\u2019re promises we can keep.\u201d\nNow just to get to the heart of the question that maybe we didn\u2019t touch about what interests a younger generation of voters. I think part of this might be a question of tone, too. I think that the younger I was, the more I was inclined to think about politics as combat. Having been responsible for a city, I think about it differently today, but what I don\u2019t view as different is the importance of restoring power to workers and citizens. When I say power, I mean both political power and wealth, which becomes both economic and political power at the expense of those who have concentrated it too much in today\u2019s world.\nNF: How would you double unionization?\nSo part of it has to do with who can organize. Making it possible, for example, for gig workers to organize, as I\u2019ve called for. Making it possible for there to be more scope for multi-employer bargaining. If you are one of those fast-food workers and you\u2019re in a McDonald\u2019s and there\u2019s an Arby\u2019s across the street, you should be able to team up.\nPart of it is how you can unionize. We have penalties for company interference in union elections, but the penalties are so weak that even when they are imposed by what I view as a much-weakened enforcement structure \u2014 both in terms of the Department of Labor and N.L.R.B. \u2014 even when they are imposed, they\u2019re not really enough to change behavior. Which is why I\u2019ve specified the need for fines in the adequate range of the multimillions that would actually make it a different calculation for companies to make it difficult to unionize and we need an end to right-to-work. Right-to-work is a restriction. It\u2019s talked about differently in conservative political language, but it is a restriction on the ability of employers and employees to negotiate, and I would remove it.\nThe Times editorial board weighed in on the importance of centering labor issues in the 2020 campaign, particularly ideas like sectoral bargaining and prohibiting \u201cright to work\u201d laws, which allow workers in union workplaces to refuse union membership.\nKK: Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to interrupt, but I want to get back to South Bend for a minute. Rape, robbery, and assaults are all crimes that are at much higher rates in South Bend than they are for example in New York City or in Indiana versus New York. Why haven\u2019t you been able to do much about those types of crimes?\nSince 2012, Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s first year in office, South Bend has averaged 5,890 reported serious crimes a year, down from an average of 6,845 in the three years prior. According to The South Bend Tribune, burglaries declined under his administration, but aggravated assaults increased.\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you what we have done. We have group violence intervention that has been able to deal with gang and group violence and in particular gun violence in our city, hasn\u2019t ended it. We\u2019ve had some terrible years, but my first year we had 18 homicides, I believe, and we have been able to see a shift in that.\nThe South Bend Group Violence Intervention strategy was introduced to the city in 2013 with the aim of curbing gun violence. The strategy, developed by David Kennedy at John Jay College, relies on direct communication with people most likely to commit violence.\nOf course, it\u2019s different from New York. The per capita personal income in my city has finally gone above $20,000. We have poverty rates similar to Baltimore\u2019s, but in many of these categories, crime rates there are different. Now having said that, I should also mention that you brought up at least two categories of crime, rape and aggravated assault, where reporting has changed. And it is my fervent hope without coming over and telling you what to do that when folks report on in particular data that is compiled in the F.B.I.\u2019s uniform crime database, U.C.R. database, that attention is paid to the language warning about why it is not a good idea to compare between the different jurisdictions due to reporting differences and also some of the pitfalls of reporting over the years when some of the standards changed.\nThe poverty rate in South Bend is estimated at 25.4 percent. The poverty rate in Baltimore is estimated at 23.8 percent.\nNF: Haven\u2019t reporting standards had been changed for other jurisdictions, too?\nSay again?\nNF: Haven\u2019t the reporting standards for aggravated assault changed for other jurisdictions, too?\nYes and no. So what happened with rape was a nationwide change in the U.C.R. reporting standards and so you can even break out what is called legacy rate and the new standard. In the case of aggravated assault, I know of changes that happened that led to more reporting of it in my jurisdiction. I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s part of moves that have been made in other police departments.\nIn 2012, the attorney general announced a new and more expansive definition of rape, a victory for survivors and advocates. The definition is available on the Department of Justice\u2019s website here.\nNF: How much of the crime increase do you think might be due to the bad relationship between the police and the black community?\nI believe police officers by and large get up in the morning and do their job no matter what\u2019s happening in politics. I do think that there is a cost to reductions in police legitimacy that come about, especially when there are cases of abuses both from around the country and what happens in any local area.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing a lot are cycles of gun violence, assault too, but especially with gun violence where you have a family, someone is attacked or killed. The family weighs whether to take that to the police or to handle that in a way that leads to more violence and so the less comfort there is reaching out to the police, the more likely it is that there will be contagion between one violent act and another. That\u2019s actually even more true as you get out of the ones that we\u2019ve been better able to get a grasp on through our group violence intervention strategy where it\u2019s connected to, whether it\u2019s a formal gang or what\u2019s called a group, it can often be comparatively easier to map and enforce on the associations that lead to that violence than when you have looser associations and sometimes families.\nNF: You mentioned poverty. You\u2019ve done in a lot in the downtown area of South Bend. In the poor neighborhoods you\u2019ve knocked down a lot of buildings and some have said you\u2019ve not done enough for housing there to replace that and that there are sort of two South Bends. Is that a fair criticism?\nKK: I want to be respectful of the mayor\u2019s time, so after this maybe we can ask you one last question and then we\u2019ll let you go. Is that O.K?\nSure, yeah. So our effort on vacant and abandoned houses was very much about directing dollars for improvement in low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods. Because the No. 1 thing I heard knocking on doors in those neighborhoods from voters and residents when I was a candidate was why has there been a collapsing house next door to me for 12 years? Often they didn\u2019t know or necessarily care that the city did not own that property, just because it was vacant and abandoned. Often we didn\u2019t even know who did own it because in our housing market, again \u2014\u2014\nI know this doesn\u2019t always compute in New York, but you can get a pretty good house on the west side of South Bend for 25 thousand bucks. So when it falls, it\u2019s in bad shape and it falls to eight or nine thousand bucks. Someone who just owns this as a line on a spreadsheet anyway, and they\u2019re not even from in town, just walks away. They don\u2019t even bother selling it or disposing of it, or they cleverly hide who owns it. Anyway, my point is we directed dollars to remove the houses that couldn\u2019t be saved and to improve the houses that could precisely because of the importance of supporting low-income neighborhoods.\nIn 2017, the median property value of a house in South Bend was $81,100, according to Data USA. Nationally that figure is closer to $217,600.\nSo while we did a lot of work in our downtown for sure, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that a downtown that used to be characterized as dead or dying is growing. It\u2019s equally important to me, if not more so, that we\u2019ve created opportunity for folks around the city and that we\u2019ve invested directly in neighborhoods. We\u2019ve also invested directly in home repair, knowing that there\u2019s not only a moral and economic empowerment rationale for keeping people in their home, but frankly it\u2019s also a public safety rationale.\nThere are a lot of folks in these neighborhoods who are not afraid of the police or don\u2019t respect the police, but they respect Grandma. And I want Grandma to be able to afford to own her home, stay there and be on her porch, as part of what keeps the fabric of the neighborhood intact and makes it safer. So there have been justified critiques that we may have used code enforcement as a blunt instrument in some cases and listening to neighborhood feedback improve that over time, but it\u2019s very important to me that it\u2019d be understood that our effort to direct dollars, whether it was for demolishing collapsing structures or for enhancing ones that could be saved, was very much about supporting low-income residents.\nKK: Brent, you want to finish?\nBS: Something we ask everybody: What is it that you are most likely to fail at as president?\nWow.\nBS: And that\u2019s the same expression we get.\nWell \u2014\u2014\nMC: Don\u2019t cop out on this.\nI know. I\u2019m tempted to go with a condiment reference, but I\u2019m going to behave. Well, let me say this. First of all, there are some problems you can solve and then there\u2019s some problems you can manage and a lot of the most important problems we face, both internationally and domestically, will be managed, improved, but we have to face that one presidential or two presidential terms won\u2019t be enough to solve them.\nIf I\u2019m being more specific about something that I don\u2019t think I will win, I would say social media. I view myself as a digital native. I spend less and less, but a fair amount of time, on social media. People in my generation have become preposterously wealthy creating it, but we have not yet got a handle on it. The one thing I am learning is just how much daylight there is between what has currency on social media and what I\u2019m getting asked about when I\u2019m on the ground, and I would not be surprised if it continues to be the case that doing what I view to be the right thing as president is not just politically costly in general but may cost me the hearts and minds of those who are disproportionately represented online.\nKK: Wait. So, your answer is you\u2019re going to get canceled on Twitter?\nI just might get canceled.\nKK: All right. Thank you very much.\nThank you.This interview was conducted Dec. 11, 2019, and published Jan. 16, 2020.

Each twinkle is a marker of attendance and a plea for freedom. The demonstrators, some clad in masks to thwart the government\u2019s network of facial recognition cameras, find safety in numbers.\nBut in addition to the bright lights, each phone is also emitting another beacon in the darkness \u2014 one that\u2019s invisible to the human eye. This signal is captured and collected, sometimes many times per minute, not by a drone but by smartphone apps. The signal keeps broadcasting, long after the protesters turn off their camera lights, head to their homes and take off their masks.\nIn the United States, and across the world, any protester who brings a phone to a public demonstration is tracked and that person\u2019s presence at the event is duly recorded in commercial datasets. At the same time, political parties are beginning to collect and purchase phone location for voter persuasion.\n\u201cWithout question it\u2019s sinister,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, professor of journalism at Columbia University and former president of Students for a Democratic Society, a prominent activist group in the 1960s. \u201cIt will chill certain constitutionally permitted expressions. If people know they\u2019ll be tracked, it will certainly make them think twice before linking themselves to a movement.\u201d\nA trove of location data with more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans obtained by Times Opinion helps to illustrate the risks that such comprehensive monitoring poses to the right of Americans to assemble and participate in a healthy democracy.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nWithin minutes, with no special training and a little bit of Google searching, Times Opinion was able to single out and identify individuals at public demonstrations large and small from coast to coast.\nBy tracking specific devices, we followed demonstrators from the 2017 Women\u2019s March back to their homes. We were able to identify individuals at the 2017 Inauguration Day Black Bloc protests. It was easy to follow them to their workplaces. In some instances \u2014 for example, a February clash between antifascists and far-right supporters of Milo Yiannopolous in Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 it took little effort to identify the homes of protesters and then their family members.\nThe anonymity of demonstrators has long been a contentious issue. Governments generally don\u2019t like the idea for fear that masked protesters might be more likely to incite riots. Several states, including New York and Georgia, have laws that prohibit wearing masks at public demonstrations. Countries including Canada and Spain have rules to limit or prohibit masks at riots or unlawful gatherings. But in the smartphone era \u2014 masked or not \u2014 no one can get lost in a sea of faces anymore.\nImagine the following nightmare scenarios: Governments using location data to identify political enemies at major protests. Prosecutors or the police using location information to intimidate criminal defendants into taking plea deals. A rogue employee at an ad-tech location company sharing raw data with a politically motivated group. A megadonor purchasing a location company to help bolster political targeting abilities for his party and using the information to dox protesters. A white supremacist group breaching the insecure servers of a small location startup and learning the home addresses of potential targets.\nRelated: This Opinion video essay imagines how\nthe civil rights protests might have unfolded if governments had access\nto today's location tracking data.\nLokman Tsui, an activist, researcher and professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told us that third parties that sell this data are a problem because \u201cthe standards to buy this information aren\u2019t that rigorous \u2014 it\u2019s not like the companies have ethical review boards. The university I\u2019m at is able to buy data, and it\u2019s fairly easy to get it. And the kind of data they can buy makes me raise my eyebrows, \u2018Oh, wow, you can buy that?\u2019 Creepy data.\u201d\nThe data doesn\u2019t even need to leak or transfer hands \u2014 its mere existence can have a chilling effect on democratic participation. Word has already spread through the more professional protester circles to leave cellphones at home, toggle them to airplane mode or simply power them off. Many antifascist protesters show up to rallies covering their faces to protect their identities from hate groups, the police and the press. \u201cBut that means you\u2019re only getting the diehards to show.... We tell people don\u2019t bring your phone to protests or if you do, keep GPS off at the very least\u2026 The more secure you are the less able you are to organize,\u201d an antifascist researcher told us. He agreed to be quoted only if we did not reveal his name.\nJoshua Wong, the activist who helped drive Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 Umbrella Movement and is now a key figure in the city\u2019s continuing protests, said that omnipresent tracking has fundamentally changed the democratic protests in Hong Kong. \u201cIn the past, they feel like, if they are not activists or high-profile figures, they are safe from surveillance as they have nothing to hide,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have come to realize recently that surveillance poses a threat to them as more are involved in the protest, and even if they are not high-profile, the government would also target them.\u201d\nEven those we identified in the data who were public about their activism were unnerved by their movements\u2019 getting catalogued in databases that can be bought, sold, merged or hacked.\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m happy to protest Trump and have people knowing about it,\u201d said Eric Hensal, who lives in Takoma Park, Md., and appeared in the dataset at a 2016 picket line protest at the Trump Hotel in Washington. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much somebody, say, a state actor could determine just by a travel pattern.

Satellite imagery:\nMicrosoft and DigitalGlobe\nGranular surveillance is still new. But some experts argue the window to define our cultural values around tracking citizens may be closing. Mr. Tsui, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, argued that there are three current competing visions for the internet built by China, the United States and the European Union. China is moving fast and breaking things, including civil rights. The E.U., with its focus on privacy, is making a moral point around surveillance and consent. And the United States, with its powerful tech companies, is caught in the middle, trying to weigh ethical concerns while still pushing forward on innovation for fear of being left behind by China. If China pushes forward, skirting human rights via technology, and the United States follows, Mr. Tsui argued that America could see an uptick in using surveillance, data and artificial intelligence to manipulate and change behavior and direct outcomes. \u201cI hope we don\u2019t end up there,\u201d he said.\nLocation data is already part of the 2020 race for the White House. Political action committees for Republicans and Democrats have invested in location data to target voters based on their interest. For example, companies are enlisting data brokers to help monitor the movements of churchgoers to find conservative-leaning voters and sway their votes.\nIn company documents from 2017, Phunware, a Texas-based technology company, describes the race to collect location data to target voters as a \u201cgold rush,\u201d suggesting that \u201cas soon as the first few political campaigns realize the value of mobile ad targeting for voter engagement, the floodgates will open. Which campaigns will get there first and strike it rich?\u201d\nThe company reportedly signed a deal with American Made Media Consultants, a company set up by the Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, to offer location collection services. Phunware touts voters\u2019 smartphones as \u201cthe ultimate voter file.\u201d Its marketing claims that mobile data can tell campaigns \u201ceverything from the device operating system (iOS or Android) to what other apps are on the device, what Wi-Fi networks the device joins and much more. And that doesn\u2019t even cover the information it\u2019s possible to infer, such as gender, age, lifestyle preferences and so on.\u201d\nThese are, of course, just the early days. Much of the political manipulation happening now looks no different from serving up a standard political ad at the right moment. The future, however, could get dark quickly. Political candidates rich in location data could combine it with financial information and other personally identifiable details to build deep psychographic profiles designed to manipulate and push voters in unseen directions. Would-be autocrats or despots could leverage this information to misinform or divide voters and keep political enemies from showing up to the polls on election day.\nThen, once in power, they could leverage their troves of data to intimidate activists and squash protests. Those brave enough to rebel might be tracked and followed to their homes. At the very least, their names could be put into registries.\nPublic dissent could quickly become too risky a proposition, given that the record of one\u2019s attendance at a rally could be held against them at a later date. Big Data, once the domain of marketers, could become a means to elevate dictators to power and then frustrate attempts to remove them.\nIt is not difficult, in other words, to imagine a system of social control arising from infrastructure built for advertising. That\u2019s why regulation is critical. \u201cIt is very clear from the examples of the intersection of authoritarianism and surveillance that we\u2019ve seen around the world that a privacy bill of rights is absolutely necessary,\u201d said Edward Markey, the Massachusetts senator who wrote the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. \u201cPrivacy needs to start being seen as a human right.\u201d\nCarlo Ratti, a professor at M.I.T. and director of its Senseable City Lab, echoed the senator\u2019s concerns. \u201cThe present path is untenable,\u201d he told us. \u201cIf you have asymmetrical control of information, it is very dangerous. Whether it\u2019s companies or states, they can crush political opponents before they can band together. If we go this route, it is very dangerous and very volatile.\u201d\nIf Hong Kong has taught the world anything, it is that surveillance systems, once in place, are nearly impossible to uproot.\n\u201cI think Hong Kong citizens are worried that they are retroactively surveilled,\u201d Mr. Wong, the activist, said. \u201cAs there are more reports revealing the effort and attempts of Beijing in monitoring its people, Hong Kong-ers are worried that they have been subjected to the same treatment.\u201d\nOver time, protest could become the exclusive right of those with the means to safeguard themselves technologically, including having a second, \u201cburner\u201d phone. \u201cIt\u2019s technologically possible to be anonymous, but it\u2019s hard,\u201d Mr. Tsui told us. \u201cYou can only protect privacy with tech right now, and so only those who have money and knowledge can do it. But privacy is not just for the rich or geeks. Privacy is for everyone.\u201d\nEven in non-authoritarian countries, the future of unfettered mobile surveillance seems likely to force dissenters into difficult decisions. \u201cThe way I see it, there\u2019s two directions this could all go. It could force people to embrace the danger of full exposure,\u201d the antifascist researcher and protester said. \u201cOr things go way underground. And things continue to heat up. It forces governments and other organizations to get more and more militant toward each other.\u201d\nThe future for the world\u2019s activists may look increasingly like Hong Kong. The leaderless protest movement of the past six months has been made possible by technology. The messageboard LIHKG and encrypted chat apps like Telegram have allowed for the kind of organization that has kept the protests going. But the movement has also been undermined by the very same technology. Protesters and journalists and even law enforcement have been doxxed (had their private information published) by the thousands. A real-time location tracking app used by protesters to identify the positions of law enforcement was taken down by Apple\u2019s App Store \u2014 suggesting that governments will have a competitive advantage when it comes to the resource.\nAnd while protesters have rebelled by wearing masks, blocking government cameras with lasers and even tearing down lampposts they suspected were outfitted with beacons and surveillance equipment, their efforts are being quietly undermined by the spies in their pockets. Like the rest of us, they are only as secure as the least secure apps on their phones.\nThe hundreds of thousands of phones that light up the sky in places like Hong Kong are the expression of peaceful opposition to authority. But the inspiring images and the democratic spirit the glittering devices represent only work if the lights are eventually able to vanish.\nCharlie Warzel (charlie.warzel@nytimes.com) is a writer at large for Opinion.

We cannot stand by and do nothing in the face of moral atrocities. But we should exercise that responsibility first and foremost through a foreign policy that prioritizes diplomacy to prevent or end conflicts and atrocities, including by reaffirming an international order that protects and values human rights around the world. In extremely rare circumstances, there may be a role for humanitarian intervention \u2014 when limited in duration, with clear objectives, authorized by Congress, within U.S. capabilities, and conducted in cooperation with partners and allies and in compliance with applicable international law.\nYes.

Instead, we should work with the countries of the region to address Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian needs and advance a negotiated path to free and fair elections as quickly as possible.\nRead full answer\n2. Iran\nIn 2015, the Obama administration signed a deal with Iran that lifted sanctions in exchange for significant limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Many Republicans fiercely objected to the deal, saying it was not tough enough, and in 2018, President Trump abandoned it and reinstated sanctions. But Iran kept up its end of the agreement until last month, when Mr. Trump ordered the killing of a top Iranian general, Qassim Suleimani. The killing of General Suleimani brought the United States to the brink of war with Iran, which retaliated by attacking two military bases that American forces were using in Iraq.\nWhat would you do with the now-abandoned Iranian nuclear deal, as negotiated in 2015?\nwarren's Answer\nI would re-enter the deal with no new preconditions.\nI would re-enter the deal with no new preconditions.\nRead full answer\n2.

Was the killing justifiable? Was it wise?\nwarren's Answer\nNo. The president's reckless decision has brought us to the brink of another war in the Middle East. His administration has produced no evidence of imminent threat and made no meaningful attempt at a legal justification. There was no prior consultation with Congress, and no serious thought put into the potential consequences for our troops and our country \u2014 or even for the president\u2019s own stated strategies in the region.

What would your diplomatic strategy be?\nwarren's Answer\nThe first thing we need to do is de-escalate and reopen channels of communication with Iran, using the P5+1 and other interlocutors. The best way to do that is to start by negotiating the re-entry of the United States and Iran into the J.C.P.O.A. if that is still possible. If the crisis and conflict President Trump has chosen to create make re-entry into the J.C.P.O.A. impossible, we can still lead with diplomacy and pursue interim confidence-building agreements that focus on our most pressing strategic priority in the region: constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nThe first thing we need to do is de-escalate and reopen channels of communication with Iran, using the P5+1 and other interlocutors.

North Korea\nDismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear program has long been an American priority, and President Trump has tried to do so through unusual means: direct diplomacy with the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. It started in Singapore in 2018 but began to fall apart last February, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim emerged from a summit meeting in Vietnam empty-handed. In the interim, sanctions have remained, the North\u2019s arsenal of weapons fuel and missiles has steadily expanded, and Mr. Kim recently threatened to resume missile tests.\nWould you continue the personal diplomacy President Trump began with Kim Jong-un?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. I would be willing to meet with Kim if it advances substantive negotiations, but not as a vanity project. Any summit must be part of a clear strategy, with substantive agreement already reached at the working level, and developed in close coordination with our allies and partners.\nYes.

Sanctions should be adjusted as needed. Certainly, we should consider strengthening them in the event of serious North Korean provocations, such as nuclear or long-range missile tests. At the same time, with verifiable steps in denuclearization, we should be prepared to negotiate appropriate sanctions relief.\nNo. Economic sanctions can provide strong leverage against North Korea and help counter proliferation but must be appropriately targeted to ensure that they don\u2019t further the suffering of the North Korean people.

An interim agreement would open the door to negotiations to reduce North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities and ballistic missiles, control conventional weapons, and address the regime\u2019s crimes against humanity. Denuclearization negotiations should also run in parallel with efforts to further dialogue between South Korea and North Korea and work towards a stable security architecture for the peninsula. A real diplomatic strategy to deal with North Korea is not only an imperative for our national security, it is the only credible path toward denuclearization.\nOur goal should be the full elimination of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and peace on the Korean Peninsula.

Afghanistan\nThe war in Afghanistan, begun after the Sept. 11 attacks, is the longest war in United States history, and documents released in December revealed that three successive presidential administrations misled the American people about the progress \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 being made on the ground. That the United States should withdraw has become a rare point of agreement between President Trump and Democrats. But there are still significant disagreements over when, and under what conditions, that withdrawal should happen.\nWould American troops be in Afghanistan at the end of your first term? If so, would you limit those troops' mission to counterterrorism and intelligence gathering?\nwarren's Answer\nNo. We have been in Afghanistan for 18 years with diminishing returns for our own security \u2014 we\u2019ve 'turned the corner' so many times it seems we\u2019re now going in circles. Expecting a military victory when a political settlement is required is unfair to our military, and unfair to the Afghan people.

That the United States should withdraw has become a rare point of agreement between President Trump and Democrats. But there are still significant disagreements over when, and under what conditions, that withdrawal should happen.\nHow long do you envision American troops being required, in any numbers, in Afghanistan?\nwarren's Answer\nIt\u2019s time to give up the false idea that keeping troops in Afghanistan endlessly makes Americans safer. I would begin to withdraw troops immediately, and at the same time I would engage in serious diplomacy to achieve our counterterrorism goals, including negotiating a sustainable political settlement between the Afghan government and the Taliban. I would also refocus on intelligence efforts, law enforcement, and international partnerships to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States, whether they originate from home or abroad.\nIt\u2019s time to give up the false idea that keeping troops in Afghanistan endlessly makes Americans safer.

These tools have been enormously successful in preventing attacks against the U.S. since 9/11 \u2014 and vastly more effective and less costly than occupying countries.\nIf Afghans make the hard decisions required to achieve peace among themselves, we should support them. Redirecting just a small fraction of the tens of billions of dollars we currently spend on military operations toward economic development and education, for example, would be a more sustainable investment in Afghanistan\u2019s stability than our current perpetuation of endless war. It\u2019s time to acknowledge that we\u2019ve achieved our main objective of decimating Al Qaeda\u2019s safe haven in the region, and to use American diplomatic muscle to bring an end to this war.\nRead full answer\n5. Israel\nIn Israel, a two-state solution \u2014 long viewed as the only workable end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \u2014 appears more distant than ever after President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced a plan that appeared to tilt the outcome in Israel\u2019s favor. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in 2018 to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was deeply polarizing. So is the B.D.S. (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement, which has grown increasingly prominent and which the House condemned in a bipartisan resolution last year.\nShould the United States maintain its current level of military aid to Israel? If not, how should the level of aid change?\nwarren's Answer\nIsrael is an important ally, and I am committed to Israel\u2019s security and safety, and to working together to combat shared threats. But it is also critical to preserve the viability of the two-state solution. In some cases, this may mean finding ways to apply pressure and create consequences for problematic behavior by both parties, as previous Democratic and Republican presidents have done.\nIsrael is an important ally, and I am committed to Israel\u2019s security and safety, and to working together to combat shared threats.

Today, the continued expansion of Israeli settlements and the increasing normalization of proposals for Israel to annex parts or all of the West Bank are the most immediate dangers to the two-state solution. I will reverse the Trump administration\u2019s new policy on settlements, which upends 40 years of bipartisan precedent, and make clear that Israeli settlements violate international law. And if Israel\u2019s government continues with steps to annex the West Bank, the U.S. should make clear that none of our aid should be used to support annexation.\nRead full answer\n5.

I would also make clear that in a two-state agreement, both parties should have the option to locate their capitals in Jerusalem \u2014 one for Israel and one for a future Palestinian state.

The fate of Palestinian refugees is one of the core issues of the conflict, and there must be a just settlement negotiated between the two sides. Through prior negotiations, a range of remedies have been developed, including Palestinian refugees returning to the new state of Palestine, obtaining permanent residency or citizenship in the countries where they reside, resettlement in other countries of their choosing, and a negotiated number returning to Israel.

If you answered no, what solution do you envision to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\nwarren's Answer\nA two-state solution is good for U.S. interests, good for Israel's security and its future, and good for Palestinian aspirations for dignity and self-determination. To achieve this, there must be an end to the Israeli occupation and the creation of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip living alongside Israel. As president, I\u2019ll take immediate steps to fix the damage caused by Donald Trump\u2019s reckless policies. I\u2019ll welcome the Palestinian General Delegation back to Washington, because we cannot advance peace when we have closed our channels of communication. I\u2019ll resume aid to the Palestinians that the Trump administration has cut off, because we cannot sustain peace without a future that brings greater freedom, prosperity, and security to the Palestinian people.\nA two-state solution is good for U.S. interests, good for Israel's security and its future, and good for Palestinian aspirations for dignity and self-determination.

And I will make it clear to the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships that incitement and incentivizing terror against civilians is unacceptable.\nA longer-term danger is the incredulity gap that has been created amongst the young Israelis and Palestinians who simply do not believe that peace is possible, where hope has been replaced by fear and mistrust.

Russia\nRussia has been a deeply destabilizing force on the world stage for several years, including through its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its meddling in the United States\u2019 2016 presidential election. After it annexed Crimea, it was suspended from the Group of Eight bloc of industrialized nations (now, in Russia\u2019s absence, the Group of Seven). But President Trump has pushed to readmit Russia to the G-7 and has held several meetings with President Vladimir Putin, the contents of which have not been disclosed.\nIf Russia continues on its current course in Ukraine and other former Soviet states, should the United States regard it as an adversary, or even an enemy?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. Unfortunately, it is clear that Vladimir Putin has decided to treat the U.S. and our allies in Europe as adversaries. In Ukraine, Russia has invaded and occupied the territory of a neighboring sovereign country in violation of international law. Beyond Ukraine, the Kremlin has conducted interference campaigns against U.S. and European democracies, orchestrated cyber attacks against NATO allies, bombed hospitals and civilians to prop up a dictator in Syria, and engaged in covert assassination campaigns in Europe. Domestically, Putin\u2019s Russia has become a corrupt autocratic state that suppresses democracy and violates the human rights of its citizens.

The G-7 was intended to allow like-minded advanced economies to develop common approaches to global problems. Russia was included in the G-7 in an effort to integrate it into Europe and to support its transition to democracy. Unfortunately, Russia\u2019s actions in recent years have demonstrated that it does not share the outlook and values of the other G-7 members.

China\nThe Chinese government has been systematically persecuting Muslim minorities: separating families, subjecting Uighurs and Kazakhs to forced labor and operating internment camps. It is also embroiled in a political crisis over Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China. At the same time, President Trump has taken a hard line on trade with China, imposing economically damaging tariffs. Last month, the United States and China signed an initial trade deal.\nShould respect for Hong Kong\u2019s political independence, under the terms of the handover agreement with Britain, be a prerequisite for normal relations and trade with China?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. Hong Kong plays a unique role in the global economy and an essential role for China. That role is sustainable only if Hong Kong is allowed to retain its democratic orientation and traditions. China should not expect that foreign governments will look the other way if it fails to live up to the international commitment it made in 1997, or that governments and companies will act as if nothing has changed if Beijing continues to undermine the rule of law that is central to that commitment and to Hong Kong's success as a global financial and commercial center.\nYes.

The Chinese government\u2019s cruel, bigoted treatment of Muslims and ethnic minorities is a horrifying violation of human rights and international law. I have supported efforts to respond strongly to these acts, including export controls on technology used for surveillance of China\u2019s Muslim communities and targeted sanctions on those who are directly responsible for these policies of oppression. My trade plan also requires that countries uphold internationally recognized human rights as a precondition for any trade agreement with America.\nYes.

NATO\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance among 29 North American and European countries, has been a linchpin of the United States\u2019 foreign policy for decades. But President Trump has often criticized the alliance, arguing that the United States gives too much and gets too little from it. During his 2016 campaign, he refused to commit to NATO\u2019s central pledge \u2014 defending other members if they are attacked \u2014 if the members in question had not met their spending commitments, and aides say that in 2018, he repeatedly suggested withdrawing. Last year, NATO agreed to reduce the United States\u2019 contribution and increase Germany\u2019s.\nShould NATO nations pay more for defense than their current commitment of at least 2 percent of G.D.P.?\nwarren's Answer\nNATO defense spending levels should not be about arbitrary spending targets. They will be about capabilities. I will build on what President Obama started by insisting on increased contributions to NATO operations and common investments in collective military capabilities. If requirements change and more than 2 percent is required, then our European allies should spend more. But if the needs of the alliance can be met investing at or less than 2 percent, then allies should spend what is needed. I will also recognize the varied and significant ways that European states contribute to global security \u2014 deploying troops to shared missions, receiving refugees and providing development assistance at some of the highest per capita rates in the world.\nNATO defense spending levels should not be about arbitrary spending targets.

Yet there are few international rules that govern the daily battles \u2014 or prevent escalation. As a shadow war emerges in cyberspace, President Trump has given far more powers to the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency.\nShould a presidential order be required to launch a cyber strike against another country, just as it is required to launch a nuclear strike?\nwarren's Answer\nYes. The same laws, values, and oversight under which the United States pursues military action should be consistently applied across domains. Any such activity should be subject to careful deliberation by the president and her advisors and the strict oversight of Congress \u2014 including offensive operations in cyberspace that rise to the level of a use of force or armed attack.\nYes.

Would you continue this policy?\nwarren's Answer\nD.O.D.\u2019s strategy of \"persistent engagement\" and defending forward to disrupt cyber threats can be a part of defending U.S. national security, but it must be paired with adequate investment in cyber security to strengthen our defenses, make attacks by our adversaries less effective, and bolster the resilience of our critical infrastructure.

National Security Strategy\nIn the post-Cold War era \u2014 and especially after the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 the focal point of American foreign policy moved to counterterrorism, the Middle East and Afghanistan. President Trump has, at least on paper, argued for shifting American foreign policy back to confront the \u201crevisionist powers\u201d of Russia and China.\nPresident Trump\u2019s national security strategy calls for shifting the focus of American foreign policy away from the Middle East and Afghanistan, and back to what it refers to as the \u201crevisionist\u201d superpowers, Russia and China. Do you agree? Why or why not?\nwarren's Answer\nDespite his campaign claims and his national security strategy, President Trump has in fact sent more troops to the Middle East and has now brought us to the brink of war with Iran. We need to end America\u2019s wars in the Middle East, not start new ones. Both China and Russia have invested heavily in their militaries and other tools of national power. Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image and ultimately remake the global order to suit their own priorities. But confronting this challenge is not solely or even primarily a question of military competition, nor should the United States seek a military conflict that would be devastating for all involved.\nDespite his campaign claims and his national security strategy, President Trump has in fact sent more troops to the Middle East and has now brought us to the brink of war with Iran.

Both hope to shape spheres of influence in their own image and ultimately remake the global order to suit their own priorities. But confronting this challenge is not solely or even primarily a question of military competition, nor should the United States seek a military conflict that would be devastating for all involved. China uses its economic might to throw its weight around on the world stage, for instance, while Russia has prioritized opportunistic harassment and covert attacks. And beyond China and Russia, we face challenges, such as cyberattacks and nuclear proliferation, that require much more than a strong military to combat. Other challenges, like climate change, cannot be solved through military action at all.\nAddressing these challenges requires prioritization. That starts with cutting our bloated defense budget \u2014 identifying which programs actually benefit American security and which merely line the pockets of defense contractors. It also requires us to reinvest in diplomacy and other tools of national power \u2014 because funding a muscular military without robust diplomacy, economic statecraft, support for civil society, and development assistance only hamstrings American national power and undercuts any military gains.\nLastly, with American power increasingly challenged from within and without, we can no longer afford to think of our domestic agenda as separate from our foreign policy. Investments at home strengthen the economy, but they also serve our national security. A stronger economy, a healthier democracy and a united people \u2014 these are the engines that power our country, and these are the investments that will project American strength and values in the world well into the 21st century.\nRead full answer\n11.

This makes it essential to understand not only the candidates\u2019 policies, but also their priorities.\nWhat would be your top priority for your secretary of state?\nwarren's Answer\nThe first priority for a new secretary of state must be to address the threat posed by climate change to the United States and the world. But to make progress on climate change, we will need to rebuild relations with our allies and partners. In fact, all of the challenges we face \u2014 from climate change to nonproliferation to the need for international norms in space and cyberspace \u2014 require a multilateral approach to solve.

Listening to someone else\u2019s phone call without a court order can also be a federal crime.\nThe Supreme Court has ruled that the location data served up by mobile phones is also covered by constitutional protections. The government can\u2019t request it without a warrant.\nBut the private sector doesn\u2019t need a warrant to get hold of your data. There\u2019s little to prevent companies from tracking the precise movements of hundreds of millions of Americans and selling copies of that dataset to anyone who can pay the price.\nThe incongruity between the robust legal regime around legacy methods of privacy invasion and the paucity of regulation around more comprehensive and intrusive modern technologies has come into sharp relief in an investigation into the location data industry by Times Opinion. The investigation, which builds on work last year by The Times\u2019s newsroom, was based on a dataset provided to Times Opinion by sources alarmed by the power of the tracking industry. The largest such file known to have been examined by journalists, it reveals more than 50 billion location pings from the phones of more than 12 million Americans across several major cities.\nBy analyzing these pings, our journalists were able to track the movements of President Trump\u2019s Secret Service guards and of senior Pentagon officials. They could follow protesters to their homes and stalk high-school students across Los Angeles. In most cases, it was child\u2019s play for them to connect a supposedly anonymous data trail to a name and an address \u2014 to a real live human being.\nYour smartphone can broadcast your exact location thousands of times per day, through hundreds of apps, instantaneously to dozens of different companies. Each of those companies has the power to follow individual mobile phones wherever they go, in near-real time.\nThat\u2019s not a glitch in the system. It is the system.\nIf the government ordered Americans to continuously provide such precise, real-time information about themselves, there would be a revolt. Members of Congress would trample one another to be first in front of the cable news cameras to quote the founders and insist on our rights to be free of such pervasive surveillance.\nYet, as a society, without ever focusing on this profound choice, we\u2019ve reached a tacit consensus to hand this data over voluntarily, even though we don\u2019t really know who\u2019s getting it or what they\u2019re doing with it. As the close of 2019 approaches, everybody is searching for the meaning of the decade. Here\u2019s a thought: This is the decade \u2014 the period since the founding of the App Store, in 2008 \u2014 in which we were brainwashed into surveilling ourselves.\nRelated: From Adam Westbrook of The New York Times Opinion Video\nFeaturing NYT columnist Farhad Manjoo and contributing opinion writer Kara Swisher.\nTo be clear: The fact that Americans are tracked by the millions is not consumers\u2019 fault. There is no good-faith \u201copt out\u201d when it comes to smartphone tracking. While there are steps that smartphone users can take to minimize the information gathered about their behavior, Americans who use surveillance devices like smartphones have only the illusion of control when it comes to protecting their privacy.\nLocation data collection is only one aspect of a surveillance economy that has sneaked into every corner of modern life. Tech companies have fostered a grass-roots surveillance culture that has convinced millions of Americans that they live better when they buy smart speakers, carry smart phones, watch smart televisions, turn their doorbells into unblinking video cameras.\nThere\u2019s no question that consumers, and society as a whole, receive many benefits from surrendering so much information, including better traffic mapping apps, more targeted advertisements and reviews of nearby restaurants. In the future, smarter artificial intelligence, safer self-driving cars and better medical care may also rely on location data. But there\u2019s no reason that data needs to be gathered surreptitiously, stored forever in a manner that puts privacy at risk and allowed to be sold to the highest bidder.\nThe dangers inherent in today\u2019s smartphones and their near-universal adoption become obvious when you consider the enormity of the information being collected and how intimate it can be: a record of people visiting drug treatment centers, strip clubs, casinos, abortion clinics or other places where social stigma can create a powerful desire for privacy. The data we reviewed also reveals Americans making routine commutes from suburban homes to secret government facilities and making trips to churches and synagogues, to counseling sessions and chemotherapy treatments.\nGiven the far richer and more detailed data files available for pay, the dataset used in our series is comparatively tiny, a fleeting look under the curtain at the most expansive corporate surveillance advertising system ever constructed. It\u2019s all perfectly legal, largely unregulated and built to turn a profit.\nAs the protesters in Hong Kong who cut down high-tech lampposts to remove the threat of facial recognition cameras illustrate, uprooting a technology from society is far more difficult than regulating it before it achieves universal adoption. Location tracking through smartphones is already a reality for most Americans. But putting basic protections in place can still better protect the privacy of a nation of digital citizens while permitting innovation.\nIf the industry believes that data is a gold mine, Congress ought to force it to adopt practices to treat data in a manner commensurate with its value. That means increased security. It means rules clear and understandable to consumers about how it will be used. It means strict oversight of data collection, with penalties for deceiving consumers. It means further restrictions on collecting and monetizing the data of minors. It also means regulations that allow Americans to see where their data goes.\nSome state and federal privacy laws apply to data that qualifies as \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d that is, information that could be used to identify a particular person, like full names, Social Security numbers and home addresses. Data classified as personally identifiable is subject to regulations that can restrict its distribution and sale, with penalties for violations.\nSince there is no uniform federal definition of personally identifiable information, the states have created their own, with sometimes conflicting results. For instance, Massachusetts and California regard ZIP codes as personally identifiable, while other states do not. Federal lawmakers ought to classify location data as personally identifiable. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced in Congress over the years that would do just this, though they haven\u2019t made it into law. But even the notion of personally identifiable information is becoming outdated since, as the Times Opinion investigation shows, so much can now be inferred from supposedly anonymous data.\nSo, as Congress considers federal privacy legislation, lawmakers could include measures to prevent the acquisition of location data if such collection isn\u2019t central to the function of the service. For instance, flashlight apps wouldn\u2019t be able to track location. A central principle of the General Data Protection Regulation, which governs privacy across the European Union, is \u201cpurpose limitation,\u201d meaning that data collected for one purpose cannot be used for another. The United States lacks such a protection \u2014 even California\u2019s new privacy law, which comes into force next year, doesn\u2019t have a purpose limitation provision.\nEven in the absence of congressional action, regulators could be taking steps to better safeguard privacy. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, could scrutinize data collection methods to see if they constitute deceptive practices under existing law.\nThe 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act provides assurances that children under 13 will not be surveilled by websites and technology companies without their parents\u2019 permission. But it is difficult if not impossible for parents to understand the scope of the data being collected about their children and the stakes of having that information bought and sold. And why are the protections only for children under 13? In other ways, our laws recognize that teenagers up to 18 deserve special protections. Lawmakers should insist on regulations that prevent companies from surveilling the movement of all minors.\nFreaked Out?\n3 Steps to Protect Your Phone\nThough studies show Americans are pleased by the convenience afforded by technological progress, many are either unsure or overwhelmed by the trade-off. If lawmakers don\u2019t act, we risk the further entrenchment of corporate surveillance in our lives.\nIt is time for Congress to hold technology and advertising companies accountable and make opting out of tracking a meaningful choice, if not the default setting. In a Capitol split by impeachment, the subject of privacy is a rare point of bipartisan concern, if not consensus.\n\u201cIt doesn't have to be this way,\u201d said Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri. \u201cThe reason it is this way is because the public is being actively misled by these tech companies when they tell the public that they can opt out. But the public can't opt out.\u201d Mr. Hawley has introduced \u2014 and attracted Democratic co-sponsors for \u2014 do-not-track legislation that would block collection of data not central to the functioning of an online service or app.\n\u201cThere is a Dickensian quality about this moment: the best and worst of times for this technology, which can enable and ennoble and degrade and debase,\u201d said Edward Markey, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. \u201cFor years, technology companies have talked about the enabling and ennobling. Now we\u2019re starting to see the degrading and the debasement.\u201d\nWhat Times Opinion has been able to show in this series reflects just a tiny fraction of the data collected from the average American on any given day. The American public should see the full scope of the corporate surveillance to which it is subjected. Lawmakers have the power to subpoena companies and demand transparency about what data they collect from American citizens and what happens to it.\nThe price of participating in modern society cannot be turning our lives into open books, diaries of all travels and relationships and wants and desires to be read and passed along by corporations \u2014 corporations that are themselves not monitored or tracked in any meaningful way. Americans need to know how their information is being gathered, and whether it is being used to manipulate them. They deserve the freedom to choose a life without surveillance.\nLike other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

Many of the world\u2019s largest coronavirus outbreaks took root in and around well-traveled cities, but they have since grown to encompass entire countries.\nCases have spread across Italy\u2019s north and down to Rome, leading to a lockdown of the entire country. Iran\u2019s capital, where leaders dismissed the virus just two weeks ago, has seen thousands infected.

South Korea has managed to slow growth of new cases for now, through intensive testing and monitoring of infections. Italy, Iran and the United States are still reporting large numbers of new cases every day.\nOfficial case totals are an imperfect method of judging the world\u2019s outbreaks. Every country has more cases than it has been able to detect through lab tests. And a shortage of testing kits in some countries, like Indonesia and the United States, along with a lack of public disclosure in others, like Egypt, means official reports are probably masking large outbreaks.\nHere\u2019s the extent of some of the largest outbreaks in the world and information on how these countries are trying to slow the spread of the virus.\nItaly\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nHUNGARY\nBergamo\n2,365+\nSWITZERLAND\nMilan\n1,305+\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780+\nSERBIA\nCROATIA\nFRANCE\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nPadua\n520+\n480+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n250+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\nFlorence\n100+\n155+\nAncona\nITALY\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nBari\nITALY\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nCatania\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nMilan\n1,305+\nHUNGARY\nBergamo\n2,365+\nSWITZERLAND\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780+\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nPadua\n520+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n480+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\nFlorence\n100+\n155+\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n315+\n50 MILES\nLodi\n1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nBergamo\n2,365\nHUNGARY\nSWITZERLAND\nMilan\n1,305+\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia\n1,780\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n480+\n515+\n360+\n495+\nPiacenza\n705+\n155+\nCremona\n1,340+\nITALY\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nLodi 1,135+\nAUSTRIA\nMilan\n1,305+\nBergamo 2,365\nHUNGARY\nLOMBARDY\nSLOVENIA\nBrescia 1,780+\nCROATIA\nVenice\n245+\n300+\nBOSNIA\nAND\nHERZEGOVINA\n360+\n495+\nFlorence\n100+\nPiacenza\n705+\nITALY\nCremona\n1,340+\nRome\n215+\nNaples\n135+\n50 MILES\nWith more than 17,000 confirmed cases, Italy has reported the largest outbreak outside of China. Italian authorities first put restrictions in place in the northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak first accelerated, before moving on Monday to restrict the movement and end public gatherings for all 60 million citizens in the country. At least 1,000 people have died because of the virus.\nOn Wednesday, the government shut down basically all commercial activities, including bars and restaurants. Supermarkets, pharmacies and newstands can remain open. All schools are closed until at least April 3. But Italy\u2019s nationwide lockdown, the first in Europe, is not a severe ban on movement like the one put in place in Wuhan, China. Italians are still able to move around for work, to buy groceries and other essentials, and for reasons having to do with health, child or senior care. Police checkpoints have been set up around the country, at which people are required to stop and fill out official forms explaining their movements.\nThe number of new cases in Italy had steadily increased for more than a week before dropping on Tuesday. On that day, though, there were still almost 1,000 new cases.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Italy each day\nItaly is aggressively testing for the virus, which could help explain why its total confirmed cases are higher than some other countries in Europe. On Tuesday, more than 60,000 tests had been performed, more than twice as many tests as the United Kingdom had done.\n\u201cToday, the red zone is Italy,\u201d Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, told The New York Times. But in 10 days, he warned, it will be Madrid, Paris and Berlin.

Unlike other countries with major outbreaks, South Korea, with a population of 50 million, has not outright restricted the movement of its citizens and has instead focused on aggressively monitoring for infections. More than 7,900 cases and 66 deaths have been reported.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in South Korea each day\nMore than 235,000 people have been tested, and health officials carefully track down people who may have symptoms, testing more than 10,000 people each day. The government even opened drive-through testing centers. While health officials are battling smaller clusters of infections in other cities, much of the effort has focused on Daegu, the center of the outbreak, where many people were infected in a large church congregation.\nHealth officials also introduced aggressive public awareness campaigns, sending out mobile phone alerts to citizens whenever a new case is reported in their districts. Updates are provided on government websites and mobile apps as to how many people have been tested and where, along with brief sketches on each patient: their gender, how they became infected and where they are being treated, as well as which places they visited before testing positive.\nOfficials have advised against holding large gatherings, like outdoor rallies and religious services.

Now, with the total number of cases standing at more than 11,000, and with more than 400 people dead, Iran is scrambling to control one of the worst outbreaks in the world.\nThe virus started in the holy city of Qom, where thousands of pilgrims from Iran and around the Middle East travel each day. Two days after the first deaths and cases of the virus were reported in Qom, Iran held parliamentary elections, which are widely believed to have been the cause of the virus spreading to other provinces.\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Iran each day\nThe authorities failed to take protective measures at this early stage. But the problem became impossible to ignore after nearly three dozen Iranian government officials and members of parliament were infected, and a senior adviser to the supreme leader died.\nNow, Friday prayers are cancelled, and schools and universities are closed until mid-April. Government offices remain open, but employees must work reduced hours. For everyone else, officials are asking people to leave their homes only when necessary.\nA severe shortage of testing kits in Iran means the spread of the virus is likely much higher than reported. One study projected a week ago that the true total of infections may have been more than 18,000, \u201cand a week ago is eons when we are talking about an epidemic,\u201d said Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto doctor who is a co-author of that study.\nSee our maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world.\nSee our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

She served as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor.\nThis interview with Ms. Hochul was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times on May 31.\nRead the board\u2019s endorsement for the Democratic gubernatorial primary here.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Thank you, Governor, for coming today. We, as you can tell, are going to have some colleagues on the screen and then, of course, in the room. I wanted to start actually by just talking a little bit about what you see as your signature issue as governor. Give us the one-minute version of what your vision is and the impact that you want to have as governor.\nYeah, I\u2019ve quickly become a crisis manager. Stepping into the job unexpectedly. Difficult circumstances. The state was in turmoil. So much had not occurred that should have occurred in the previous months. So I had to step in and start fixing things. And that meant getting $2 billion out for excluded workers, a billion dollars for people who needed to get directly. All of this was jammed up when I took office. Had to deal with not one but two hurricanes and the cleanup in the aftermath of the loss of 13 lives.Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding across New York, including in the Queens neighborhood of East Elmhurst. In New York City, at least 13 people died, most of whom were trapped in flooded basement apartments. Many others lost their homes to the destruction. And I\u2019ve been dealing with the pandemic at the same time as the numbers started going up, and we had to adapt our response, vaccine mandates, not mandates, masks in schools. So we had a lot of decisions.\nBut I\u2019ve learned about myself, even more so, and my leadership style. It\u2019s collaborative, but it\u2019s very decisive. You know, I see a problem, I tackle it, I move on, because there\u2019s always another one right behind it. So my signature approach is to realize that the core of everything I do, my job is to protect New Yorkers. I have to protect them from crime. I have to protect them from Covid. I have to protect them from losing their homes. I have to protect them from losing their jobs when they didn\u2019t have child care. So I feel a moral responsibility as a leader of this state to protect New Yorkers in every way I can.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Five years from now, assuming you are elected, what do you want your legacy to be? What do you, what is the thing that you hope \u2014 I mean, of course, dealing with the crisis, day-to-day crises is important \u2014 but what do you hope to use this platform that you have to accomplish?\nI\u2019d hope in five years and even beyond that history will judge this time, judge me on how we brought the state and the city back after the pandemic. We were the epicenter of the pandemic. We were knocked down to our knees. We still have businesses that are suffering. We still have moms who can\u2019t go back to work because their child care provider doesn\u2019t, isn\u2019t back there anymore. We\u2019ve \u2014 our health care system was brought to its knees.\nThe disparity in outcomes between Black and brown communities and white communities is abhorrent. There were so many things that emerged, and even the educational disparities, the digital divide was so crystal clear to us, and we saw that kids were not learning.\nI talked to a minister up in Harlem who told me he used to go to McDonald\u2019s every morning and take a class \u2014 his wife is a teacher \u2014 take a class of kids and ask, \u201cIf I bought them all breakfast, can they use your internet connection so they can sit here and get some learning in?\u201d That wasn\u2019t happening in Westchester. So I\u2019m angered by that. But I also know that my legacy is that we\u2019re going to try our very best to eradicate all those disparities. I have a commission that\u2019s convening not just to look at the response at the time. We\u2019re not looking to point fingers, but I need to know what went right and went wrong and focus on what went wrong so we fix it. And that\u2019s the challenge we face. And to restore that sense of exceptionalism that we all have as New Yorkers, bring this city back and make people feel proud of it again.\nYou know, I spoke at 9/11 yesterday, the 20th anniversary of when, after 260 days, they closed up and finished the recovery, the rescue-recovery effort. And we talk about how knocked down so hard that no one ever thought that Lower Manhattan would rebuild and come back the way it did. I want the legacy of our administration to be the one that said, \u201cLook, look back at what they did,\u201d 20 years, 30 years, 50 years from now. And I expect to be judged that way.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Mara?\nMara Gay: In a previous political lifetime, you had a very different position on guns. Obviously the country is enmeshed in a very painful conversation around guns. As a member of Congress, you received an endorsement from the N.R.A. You once voted to allow individuals to carry, to conceal and carry.In 2011, when Ms. Hochul was a member of the House of Representatives, she voted for the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act, which would have expanded the right to carry concealed firearms across state lines. This would have eroded state authority to determine who is permitted to carry a concealed weapon within its borders. The bill died in the Senate. And then when you became lieutenant governor, your views and constituency certainly changed. What\u2019s really in your heart about guns? Can you talk to us about that?\nI lived in a different culture. In my congressional district, I remember going to a Christmas party. And I was the county clerk before that. I oversaw the pistol permit office. So I, it was, I mean, I ran the D.M.V.s, I ran the court clerks, I ran the land records. One of the responsibilities is running the pistol [inaudible] permit office. And I know how long it took. It took a long time. It took about a year to get a pistol permit, which is another topic. I want to make sure that happens. We\u2019re going to pass the legislation this week.Ms. Hochul signed a comprehensive series of gun-safety bills into law on June 6. One measure raises the age to buy a semiautomatic rifle to 21.\nSo I would go to a Christmas party, and members of the Working Families Party and the Democratic Party would come up to me and say, you know, \u201cHow\u2019s my pistol permit going?\u201d So there was, it was a different culture there, but that was the representation I had then. I\u2019ve evolved dramatically, especially after Sandy Hook. It was 10 years ago, and I said no more.\nI mean, you can\u2019t, if you\u2019re going to fight background checks, something that we did in New York, that\u2019s something I was responsible for \u2014 making sure there were mental health checks and state police checks and neighbor checks. I know what a background check is all about. My office had to conduct them, make sure they were done thoroughly. And we couldn\u2019t do that after the slaughter of first graders at Sandy Hook? So I became converted, in a sense, like not many people have. That evolution is an evolution that we need to have more people have. And I\u2019m the best person to talk about that. And that\u2019s why we have to change the hearts and minds of people right now.\nAnd I was reading an article yesterday about an N.R.A. member who took his \u2014 in Texas \u2014 took his AR-15 and turned it in to the local police department, and he says, I\u2019m done with this. I don\u2019t want to be part of this anymore. We\u2019re at an awakening time. And this is an opportunity for me to lead with bold plans, be nation leading and leave no stone unturned. \u2019Cause I understand the cultural differences. I know the resistance that\u2019s going to be out there, and I can speak that language and help them understand. I understand the Second Amendment, but that doesn\u2019t know how to protect military-style assault weapons or the ability of someone to go to Pennsylvania and to buy a 30 magazine capacity, high-capacity magazine that slaughtered my neighbors in Buffalo. So I\u2019m \u2014 this is a cause for me. This is a cause.\nMara Gay: Do you own a gun?\nNo.\nMara Gay: Did you ever own a gun?\nNo.\nEleanor Randolph: If the Supreme Court rules against the New York law,State law currently requires that people who want a license to carry a gun in public show \u201cproper cause.\u201d how do you see New York getting around that?\nWell, we\u2019re not telegraphing right now because the decision isn\u2019t rendered, and we don\u2019t want anything we say or do to affect that in the sense that \u2026 I want to see what they come down with. We\u2019ve already had a lot of conversation about this. My team, ever since this case went to the Supreme Court, we knew a decision would be rendered literally in June. So we\u2019re prepared, and I\u2019m prepared to call the legislature back to find a way that we believe will legally find a way to allow us to do what we want to do, which is to protect New York.\nThis law, this wasn\u2019t even part of the Safe Act.The first major set of state-level gun bills that was passed after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. This, the law that\u2019s challenged has been in effect since early 1900s. And I had people come in my pistol permit office and ask for concealed carry. We told them no. I mean, unless you\u2019re law enforcement, you know, a security guard or have a reason, we can\u2019t just say, \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d I don\u2019t want him to be able to walk into the next Tops grocery store in Buffalo with something legally hidden in their pocket. And then we\u2019re Wild West. That\u2019s the Wild West. We\u2019re not going there. So we\u2019ll find a way.\nI\u2019ll call back the legislature, I\u2019ve already put them on notice. Are you ready to adapt your plans? Or maybe it\u2019ll happen soon enough. Well, it hasn\u2019t happened. They\u2019ll be gone Thursday or Friday, so I\u2019ll take whatever. I called them back my first week on the job to deal with the eviction moratorium that, it was supposed to end Sept. 1. I said the money didn\u2019t get out. It\u2019s not their fault. We can\u2019t punish people. All over the country, it all ended Sept. 1. I moved it to Jan. 15. I got the legislature back. So I\u2019m prepared to do the same thing.\nMara Gay: There\u2019s a lot to go over with gun policy. We have so much to cover here. I don\u2019t want to go too deep into the weeds, but could you give us a top-line sense of what could be done to strengthen the state\u2019s red-flag implementation rather than the law? Because the criticism is that the training hasn\u2019t happened, that police departments across the state don\u2019t, aren\u2019t aware of what needs to be done to prevent shootings like what happened in Buffalo.\nWell, you hit right on it. A law doesn\u2019t mean anything if people don\u2019t understand it or that they\u2019re afraid to go too far. I want people to feel \u2014 I\u2019d rather go too far on the front end than afterward, when we connect the dots, say, \u201cOh, that one could have been prevented.\u201d That\u2019s not OK.\nJust a couple of days ago, I convened our intra \u2014 I have an interstate, nine-state group of, dealing with, they\u2019re dealing with gun interdiction, but I brought together everybody in the state and says, \u201cI don\u2019t want us to be in the business of solving crimes. I want us to be in the business of preventing these crimes.\u201d So you have the tools, you know, whether it\u2019s the social media component or whatever, but the red-flag law that I do with executive action. I didn\u2019t even wait for the legislature.\nI told the state police, you will use your judgment. You will understand that your job is to get that extreme protect, order of protection in place when you see the signs that you\u2019ve been trained to. Now that\u2019s my state police. What the law is saying is part of a comprehensive package that we\u2019re working with the legislature to get through this in a couple of days.\nIt\u2019ll require all people to have to follow stricter standards and be looking for. And when a flag comes up, I try to remember the language. I was looking at it late last night. But it\u2019s a lower standard. It\u2019s a lower standard than had been in place before. And the training has to occur, and we\u2019ll take that on. I told my head of state police, \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for this.\u201d I want to make sure that everybody understands, not just law enforcement, schoolteachers, guidance counselors, coaches, parents.\nMara Gay: Just to drill down on that: What specifically is your office doing to ensure that local police departments and local school districts are \u2014\nWe\u2019re requiring them to be trained. We are putting together the training program to do this. We\u2019re doing it right now. And that\u2019s getting out there. I\u2019m very impatient. I\u2019m not waiting for the next mass casualty to happen in our state.\nMara Gay: Thank you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I want to change topics. Nick, do you want to ask about Brian Benjamin?Ms. Hochul\u2019s former lieutenant governor and running mate, who resigned after Manhattan prosecutors brought bribery charges against him.\nNick Fox: Yeah. You\u2019ve been criticized for the vetting of Brian Benjamin, but you didn\u2019t really need to vet him. A Google search would\u2019ve found people who supposedly gave to his campaign and never even heard of him. One of the donors was the 2-year-old grandson of an alleged partner in crime. He had suspicious reimbursements from his campaign for personal expenses, apparently including his wedding celebration. As a state senator, he was paid by his former company and lied about it. He had to resign from the board of another company after he was criticized for working with a major player in the subprime, subprime mortgage crisis. Apparently, it was no secret that he had tax \u2014 why were you in such a hurry to appoint him?\nWe were a state in crisis. We didn\u2019t have leadership. I had to step in. I needed to let people know that I\u2019d also have someone at my side who could step in if necessary. But I\u2019ll tell you, that was, personally, very not just disappointing. It was painful to realize that, you know, there were things, signs that were missed, that more could have been done.\nI had a very small team. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to rely on the Cuomo people to do our vetting for us. I was still lieutenant governor. I was still lieutenant governor. And we had to start the vetting process and to use a very small group of people. And yes, I would say the system did not work. We\u2019ll get it right. We\u2019ll get it right this time. And that is something I take seriously because I made a commitment to New Yorkers when I was sworn in. And I want to restore their faith in government. That was a setback. And I have the responsibility to restore that faith again. And I do believe that, you know, we had more time. I had more resources, more staff. The work that we did to vet my new lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado was, was successful. And as people get to know him, they\u2019ll understand why I selected someone of his caliber.\nNick Fox: I still don\u2019t understand the hurry. I mean, it was about two weeks it took to pick him. There is a constitutional line of succession if you needed a successor, which I [inaudible]. Why did you need to go to a guy that had so many red flags? I can tell you, even when we were considering him in his comptroller campaign, all this stuff came up.\nThe early vetting process did not work. I didn\u2019t personally conduct it, but I take full responsibility for everything that happens. It\u2019s my job as a leader. I was also trying to find a chief of staff and a secretary to the governor and the head of state operations. And I had to get a legal counsel. I had nobody. I had nobody. So I, I rely on people. I identify, I said, I want someone who\u2019s, you know, someone I can trust, someone that\u2019s, I\u2019ve worked with before. I had gone to Harlem many times with Brian Benjamin. I know he was well liked in his district. We spent time together.\nBut I said mistakes were made. And what I\u2019m saying is I understand that. I understand the weight that\u2019s on my shoulders to get it right and never let that happen again. I was able to find Kathryn Garcia to run state operations, Karen Keogh, Liz Fine, you know, Hope Knight to be head of economic development, Adrienne Harris to be head of, you know, the regulator Wall Street unit. And I was focused on diversity. So I have the most diverse \u2014 racially, ethnically but also gender-wise \u2014 administration that the state has ever seen and may ever see in the future. That was, I had to put together an entire team. Who\u2019s going to run my homeland security? I have a hurricane I\u2019m cleaning up after. Who\u2019s running my state operations?\nI mean, it was, it was a time when there was not \u2014 I\u2019m going to accept responsibility. I\u2019ll just do that, because it was not done right. It was enormously, personally disappointing to know that that happened. And it won\u2019t happen again.\nNick Fox: Just one quick thing. Did anyone tell you, \u201cWatch out for this guy\u201d?\nNo. Because \u2014 let me put it this way. Absolutely, if I knew now, knew then what I know now, why would I select someone like that? I was basing on a relationship I had with him independent. I had worked with him in the legislature. I\u2019d gone to his district. I\u2019d gone to events with him. I knew him as a person. I didn\u2019t know this. And no, I didn\u2019t do personal Google searches, and our team failed in that regard. We did not have the information. Or they asked him questions; he answered them satisfactory to the people that were doing it. But I had a very small team. But the buck will always stop with me. I accept that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti, do you want to ask about \u2014\nJyoti Thottam: Cuomo or domestic?\nKathleen Kingsbury: Whichever you would prefer.\nJyoti Thottam: Again, just looking at what you inherited: Governor Cuomo was widely criticized for certain parts of the way he handled the pandemic, specifically nursing homes.A state audit found that health officials under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration concealed the deaths of 4,100 nursing home residents during the first year of the pandemic. So I wanted to ask you what you have done in the years since you\u2019ve taken office to improve that situation to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. And then, just separately, is there anything you would have done differently in your handling of the pandemic?\nWell, the first thing I did very early in my administration was bring in the families who wanted someone to at least acknowledge that they were owed an apology. I brought them in. They have been very vocal in their criticism. And I said, you know, these are human beings who lost a loved one. They lost a parent, lost a grandparent. They lost an uncle. Just bring them in and treat them like human beings. Acknowledge their pain. And vow to do better. And I told him that I would at the right time.\nYou know, we are still dealing with the remnants of Delta. We had a drop for about three weeks, and then we had Omicron. And I watched the numbers like a hawk. It\u2019s the first thing I do every morning. I mean, is there anything happening? What are our hospitals looking like? What are our nursing homes looking like?\nSo we had a difficult situation at a time then, and I\u2019ll give you this other challenge we had in the fall when I was taking on. I wanted health care workers to be vaccinated. I didn\u2019t think that anybody going to a hospital or a nursing home should encounter someone who was supposed to make them healthy who actually could give them the virus. That was more resistance than anything I\u2019ve done yet.\nBut we fought through it. We needed to. We stood firm, and I wanted \u2014 I said, I have to protect the nursing homes. We saw the vulnerability. So every time we had, you know, an effort toward getting more vaccines out and boosters, job No. 1: Get them to the nursing homes. Get them to the nursing homes. No excuses. Call them up. Did they administer them? Did they need help? I literally sent the National Guard into nursing homes. Unprecedented step I took, because we had a shortage of workers once I required that they had to be vaccinated. And secondly, a lot of them were getting sick themselves, and someone is walking off the job. So it was too much.\nSo I had to bring in resources to make sure that this, the most vulnerable population in our state had more protection than anybody. Test kits went there first. Like, I kept the rules in place to make sure we limited visitors for the longest time. And I knew it was painful, but I had to do this to protect them. So having learned that lesson or saw what happened under my predecessor, I said, \u201cHow do we not protect them the most? Sending people back who are Covid positive.\u201d It was wrong.\nMara Gay: Do you think the public is owed, in general in New York, an apology from \u2014 obviously you were not governor at the time \u2014 but from, I guess, yourself or the administration or the leaders of the state, of the city. Given how Covid unfolded in New York and the mistakes that were made early on, is there a broader apology that is owed to the residents of New York?\nI do think that the residents of New York, on balance, thought that a lot of decisions were made that were intended to protect them. That shutting things down quickly \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to armchair quarterback all this, but I have a group of independent researchers and investigators and a team who will. I will await the judgment on that because I want a very thorough analysis. The good, the bad, the ugly. I said to let us know what \u2014 and I\u2019m bringing together outside consultants, not the same consultants that were advising the previous administration, because everybody\u2019s going to want to make sure, like, they look like they did everything right.\nI want to know, \u201cCould different decisions have been made?\u201d But you look at other states, no other state was hit as hard as we were. No other state had, had trucks to take \u2014 it was hard. And I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. Everyone lived through this. No other state suffered as much as we did. And I do believe that, that my predecessor worked hard to ensure that people felt trust and confident in what was going on. That was a point of those daily press conferences. That was his effort to \u2014 and again, I don\u2019t really want to be talking about him today, but, you know, he had his approach. And if you look at what people said at the time, that was comforting to them.\nBut as we analyze it and look at the different decision points along the way, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be experts who will tell us these were done right, these were done wrong, and these are in a gray area. My responsibility as governor is to put it all together and hand it off to the next leaders and say, \u201cIf there is a pandemic \u2026.\u201d And it may not be every hundred years anymore. It may be every couple of years, where our vaccines that we\u2019re relying on now \u2014 I just had Covid the first time in two years, on Mother\u2019s Day. I got it going down to see my new grandbaby. So I was very sad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t get on the plane. But because I was double boosted, it was my, other people early on didn\u2019t have that. But it turns out that the next variant comes through, and everything we\u2019ve done is not protecting us anymore, and we start over from Square 1. I have to be ready for that.\nThis is what I think about: I think about the worst-case scenario. Anything that can happen. And at the same time, another hurricane is going to hit us. I mean, this is, you know, this is, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just hard-wired to think of the worst and then how I get through it. I have to have a plan. I have to be ready for it.\nSo the answer is, if the people of New York want an apology, I\u2019ll give them an apology. Certainly those nursing home families deserved one, and I gave it to them. And I\u2019ll continue working with them. But I also had to be focused on preparing for the future. That\u2019s why back in November, the day that Omicron was, was named as a variant, I ordered, I said, \u201cI want to amass every single test kit I can.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell the people of this state there are not enough test kits, there\u2019s not enough medications.\u201d I said, \u201cStart stockpiling.\u201d So I had 92 million test kits that I got out to schools, nursing homes, prisons, jails. That was my job. That was an intense time running sort of military style operation, you know, deploying. I had National Guard in hospitals. I had them all over the place.\nJyoti Thottam: What would you have done differently?\nWhat would I have done differently? I would have involved the local health departments. This was so driven from the top. Because I was out there in the battlefield. I was working hands on in the western New York upstate response. And I work with the county leaders. I convened phone calls every week with them. Actually every day for a while. And then every three days. At least it went up to every week, but initially it was every day phone calls.\nAnd they had people, public health people that were trained. Like they said, this was like getting ready for their own \u2014 their words \u2014 \u201cThis is our Super Bowl. We train our whole lives to be ready for something like that. We\u2019ve dealt with all the other viruses that have come through. We\u2019re ready for this one.\u201d And there was, decisions were made to say, \u201cNo, no, only the state can make these decisions.\u201d And you lost that local buy-in to get them engaged and helping us get, you know, the test, testing sites up and the vaccines out there and the boosters. I wouldn\u2019t do that. I come from local government. I understand that they need to be brought in at the table, and they were not during this entire process. I changed that immediately. I changed that immediately.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I want to turn to a more current crisis. Binya, do you want to jump in on housing, please?\nBinya Appelbaum: Governor, your administration backed a modest but useful change that would have made it easier to build accessory dwelling units.A term for secondary housing structures on the property of existing homes. in areas like Long Island and then backed away from it because the reaction was so negative. I\u2019m curious: Generally, how do we make progress on making it possible to build more housing in places like Long Island in the face of intense local resistance? How does your administration move forward?\nBefore the pandemic, we had an affordability crisis in housing. Now it\u2019s a crisis on steroids. It has gotten so much worse. And I\u2019m approaching the need for more affordable housing from many fronts.\nOne is, what I can do directly is to direct and put in my budget $25 billion, unprecedented amount of money, toward building new affordable housing, 100,000 units, of which about 10,000 will be supportive housing. That\u2019s going to take some time to build. I understand that.\nI saw accessory dwelling units as I walked the streets not one day, not two but three days after [inaudible]. And then I went back to East Elmhurst after the flood.Last August, Hurricane Henri broke the city\u2019s rainfall record. Just 10 days later, Hurricane Ida\u2019s downpours surpassed it in intensity, destruction and human toll. Because I thought \u2014 those people looked at me, and they said: You\u2019re never going to come back here. Here today. I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m coming back tomorrow. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d Those people lived in unregulated basements, and they literally were flooded and died in their homes because no one regulated them. No one made sure that there was an exit. It was just \u2014 it was a hellhole where they lived. And they\u2019re mostly new New Yorkers. These were members of the immigrant community. They\u2019re our neighbors.\nSo I thought one of the ways we could do it is to give the city \u2014 particularly what they\u2019re asking for is the ability to have these granny units and have your, you know, your adult kids who can\u2019t afford a place to live with you. But the resistance on Long Island was fierce. And I realize that my experience in local government told me that the way to get the local buy-in is not so much with the stick but with the carrot. So I said, \u201cLet\u2019s come back,\u201d because the legislators, the senators, the assembly members, you know, asked us to take another look at this, so I was responding to them. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up on this,\u201d but I\u2019m going to do is see are there incentives?\nI mean, when I was a local government official for 14 years, someone said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this incentive to do something,\u201d you\u2019ve got my attention. If you\u2019re going to beat me down and say it\u2019s now state overtaking your local zoning, you\u2019re going to get resistance. So we put the ideas forward to start the conversation as well as transit-oriented development. I talked about the places I\u2019ve been, Ronkonkoma and Wyandanch. I mean, these were transformative places, where it\u2019s just been unused brownfields next to transit stations, and all of a sudden they\u2019re beautiful homes for people with affordability.\nSo I see the future. I know how it should be done. But I also know that you can\u2019t just let people \u2014 people have been trying for years \u2014 you can\u2019t just come in and overrule local zoning without giving them an incentive. And I can find those incentives, and I\u2019m going to work with them. I\u2019m committed to doing that, but we have to do so much more in the affordable housing space because \u2014\nBinya Appelbaum: I\u2019m sorry but why not? These are communities that are essentially operating as private clubs. They\u2019re refusing to permit development of affordable units. When they are incentivized to do so, they occasionally allow the construction of isolated projects. But every assessment of Long Island\u2019s housing needs finds that there are thousands of additional units needed and that there\u2019s no way to build them under current law. Why not require these communities to do their fair share? Every other state in the Northeast has laws that require that. New York stands alone in not legislating requirements for local communities. Why are we the only state that doesn\u2019t impose those standard requirements?\nWell, you hit exactly on the answer. The word was \u201clegislate.\u201d The governor puts forth a vision, solutions, ideas in my State of the State and in my budget. But I have to get buy-in from a legislature. That is what I have to work on. And as we\u2019ve seen, many ideas that are powerful and make sense, they take time to develop. If it doesn\u2019t happen the first time, I don\u2019t throw in the towel and say, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d I say, \u201cOK, now I need to build a coalition about this.\u201d I need to get people, the residents. Residents have to be educated on how this is beneficial to them to bring more people to their communities and to just, it actually helps expand the tax base. I\u2019ll find all the rationale that I need to use to get the buy-in from the residents to put pressure on their elected officials. I\u2019m figuring out the strategy. I can\u2019t do it alone. If I could, it would be the law of the land.\nMara Gay: One brief follow-up to that. I was on the L.I.R.R. yesterday. All of those train stations that are being constructed. You could theoretically, whether you follow through or not, say no more new infrastructure for Long Island. You control the M.T.A., unless you start buying into a regional housing plan like every other state, as Binya is talking about, so why not use that?\nThat is definitely an option. You know, we put forth our plan that we\u2019d hope would be accepted. We understood, having seen the resistance, that, OK, there\u2019s got to be another approach. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, building in this off-season, when the sessions, when they\u2019re out of session. I said this is a top priority of mine. But, you know, it\u2019s, it cannot be segregation. You know, I grew up in a household where my parents were fighting segregation in neighborhoods back when I was a kid. I mean, it was not a popular thing to do in a white neighborhood.\nBut I remember as a child, my parents, there was a program called Housing Opportunities Made Equal. Started back then. And so, this is part of who I am. So I will try to find the answers and work with people and take the ideas from, from our journalists and experts and people in academia to find out how to get this done.\nThere are places on Long Island that are beautiful examples and transit hubs. You know, like I mentioned, Wyandanch and Ronkonkoma. They are great models that I\u2019m going to go out there and educate and say, \u201cLook at this. This is what you are afraid of? Do you realize how amazing this is? There\u2019s little coffee shops and little stores, and people are living above.\u201d\nI\u2019ve walked through these buildings, and no one should be afraid of them. It\u2019s where people deserve to live. Young people, senior citizens, people who are essential workers who don\u2019t have high incomes. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But I\u2019m willing to. I mean, a lot of important ideas take some time. But I\u2019m willing to. I already jumped in the water on this one, and I\u2019m going to keep swimming.\nEleanor Randolph: So, Governor, could we talk a little bit about the potential conflict of interest that people in Albany talk about all the time? First with the Buffalo Billion. And your husband is a lobbyist with Delaware North, and one of your, one of the people on your staff who\u2019s supposed to be looking at your recusal document, her husband works for Bolton-St. Johns,After this interview was published, Thomas P. Connolly Jr. of Bolton-St. Johns told The Times that the company did not lobby lawmakers in Albany to help build the Buffalo stadium. which is the lobbying group that dealt with the Buffalo stadium. So how do you deal with the potential for a conflict of interest there? Will you or your family gain anything from the Buffalo stadium, the Buffalo Billion?\nAbsolutely not. First of all, my husband is not a lobbyist.\nEleanor Randolph: No, I know he isn\u2019t. But he \u2014\nBut the company, but, but Delaware North, simply provides the concessions. They have nothing to do with the stadium. If the Buffalo Bills went to Los Angeles, like they\u2019re looking to do, which \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: But they hired the lobbyists to do this, well in St. John.\nWell, my \u2014 all the recusals are handled by Liz Fine, our counsel\u2019s office. Her husband works at the Brennan justice center. So, Liz Fine. I have attorneys who are responsible. I have signed recusal forms back early in my tenure. My husband\u2019s salary has been adjusted. So there\u2019s no, no revenues, no revenues that he takes part of it, in terms of any benefit. This is a very small part of Delaware North\u2019s overall portfolio. From what I read in the paper, they may have operations around the globe. So this is a small part. They just do the concessions. They don\u2019t own the team. They\u2019re just one of the concessionaires.\nBut I understand when people raise this, I mean, integrity is very important to me. I spent my entire life in public service. My husband was a federal prosecutor for 30 years. He was Barack Obama\u2019s United States attorney. We are well accustomed to the separation that\u2019s required between our careers. We\u2019ve always lived that way. And so he has been, you know, since Donald Trump took office and he left the U.S. attorney, you know, he has been in the private sector. But we are very, very, very careful about not having any involvement or engagement or financial gain that comes from anything involved here. I appreciate the question, but integrity is very important to both of us.\nEleanor Randolph: Let\u2019s go back and talk. Sorry \u2014\nKathleen Kingsbury: Could you speak a little bit more broadly about what you see as the return on investment for this new stadium?Ms. Hochul helped negotiate a deal with the Buffalo Bills to build a $1.4 billion stadium for the team. Taxpayers will fund much of it.\nSure. It\u2019ll pay for itself in a matter of years, for sure. You know, I understand people\u2019s questions about it. It is a regional priority. And just to draw an analogy, I was on Broadway a couple days ago, and I thought, the Buffalo Bills, part of western New York the way Broadway is to New York City. Its unique asset is something that gives you a sense of pride and galvanizes a community that doesn\u2019t have a whole lot sometimes, you know? For a long time, now we have so much more in Buffalo.\nFor a long time, that was a cohesive part of the community, and they were actually very much able to leave the state. They\u2019re being wooed by larger markets, a very small market. So the timing was not ideal. Barely 30 years, and the stadium started crumbling at the upper decks. They were ready to look at other places if there was not a plan. They asked for 1.4 billion, the whole cost. I said no. Our share ended up being 43 percent of it.\nPeople will criticize. It\u2019s a regional priority, a regional asset, very important to majority leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes. Very important to the head of transportation, Senator Tim Kennedy. So the legislators locally, this is very, very important to them as well. It\u2019ll create 10,000 jobs. It\u2019ll pay for itself. The economic benefit from the study we had AECOM do independently just to find out if this made sense. $350 million. That might be on the high end, but the salaries of the players, if you calculated what paid more, the income tax on the salaries of the players will more than pay for the state investment.\nSo it\u2019s a lot to explain to people. It comes down to a sound bite, you know, giveaways to billionaire donors. They\u2019re not my donors. I never took a dime from them. The state owns the stadium. This is not for them. It\u2019s for the, for the asset, to have that in our community. But I\u2019m going to continue finding ways to lift up all communities and investing in signature projects for them, to have that same sense of pride that I know, as someone from Buffalo, that people have with their other assets. So I\u2019m going to make those investments all over. I understand people\u2019s questions. I really do.\nMara Gay: Great. We\u2019re just going to do a little bit of a lightning round here for fun. How much has the annual ridership of the subway declined since 2019, about? An estimate is fine.\nWell, it declined down to about, you know, a small percentage, but right now, we\u2019re at about 60 or 70 percent.\nI find the ridership is actually higher. This is funny. It\u2019s declined during normal commuting hours, but it\u2019s up almost back to normal on weekends and evenings. So that says to me, people are, you know, afraid to go to work on the subway, but they\u2019re not afraid to go take the subway. So we\u2019re back up to about 60, 70 percent now.\nMara Gay: Which is about how many million riders?\nThree million, three and a half.\nMara Gay: Three and a half, yeah. Under what circumstances are abortions allowed in New York after 24 weeks of pregnancy?\nHealth of the mother.\nMara Gay: And also viability of the fetus.\nOh, yes, yeah.\nMara Gay: What is the average cost of SUNY tuition, including room and board, for one year?\nWith or without my tuition assistance plan?\nMara Gay: Full. Full cost.\nI don\u2019t know that exactly.\nMara Gay: An estimate is fine.\nTen?\nMara Gay: 23,000.\nOh, OK. You said room and board?\nMara Gay: Including room and board.\nI\u2019m sorry, I fixed on tuition. Ten\u2019s the tuition here. But I am very happy that we now have it available for part-time students. Nobody\u2019s done that before. That was huge. And I hear that everywhere I go. People are so excited they don\u2019t have to try to figure out how to work full time, take a semester off, work full time. Now it\u2019s part time, so I\u2019m really excited about that \u2014\nMara Gay: Sorry, can I speak? It\u2019s the lightning round \u2014\nGo ahead, go ahead.\nMara Gay: Thank you. Where\u2019d you go on your last vacation?\nPortugal. Um, five, four years ago. Three years ago. Maybe three years ago.\nMara Gay: What is the median sale price of a home in Rochester? A guess is fine.\nWhat part of Rochester? The city? Downtown?\nMara Gay: Well, it\u2019s the median so \u2014\nI know the region. Parts of the region is very affluent.\nMara Gay: Rochester proper.\nI\u2019d say downtown Rochester, median houses are about 78.\nMara Gay: $180,000. What about \u2014\nI\u2019m thinking downtown Rochester. Check on that for me. Because it\u2019s like downtown Buffalo.\nMara Gay: OK. I will. What about White Plains?\nEight?\nMara Gay: $730,000. And Staten Island?\nThat always shocks me. The houses are so small. I\u2019d say five or six. Yeah, five or six.\nMara Gay: $640,000. What was your favorite class \u2014\nI know what an apartment costs in Brooklyn, too. About four.\nMara Gay: What was your favorite class in high school?\nSocial studies.\nMara Gay: Great. Thank you for that. So I just wanted to turn to the budget for a moment, Governor. Blair Horner of NYPIRG, the good-government group, said that the budget you negotiated was one of the most secretive he\u2019d ever seen. I mean, first of all, just what is your response to that? I mean, criticism of Governor Cuomo was very similar. But what will you do differently to give us a more transparent budget process? How do you justify that?\nI also listen to other voices, someone like Dick Gottfried, who told me it\u2019s the best budget he\u2019s seen in 50 years. We put forth our plan in January. I\u2019m not sure what was secretive about it. I laid it all out. I announced my State of the State. I put forth the budget. It was seen by the world in, in mid-January. And basically most of that budget stayed intact, except we increased it. And the leaders were so stunned because they are so used to the game playing, where they take away money for health care and education and child care and pre-K and the environment.\nAnd then you had to beg to have it out, you had to deal to get it put back in. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not playing games.\u201d I\u2019m more collaborative. I said I would be, and I am. So everybody still didn\u2019t quite trust it when I put forth, you know, transformational amounts of money in, in health care and education and child care infrastructure. We can talk about it. I\u2019m heading over to the East Side Access to make the announcement shortly.\nWe did it differently, you know. We laid it all out there. And I didn\u2019t make them have to fight, borrow and steal and negotiate. We increased our, our environmental bond act from $3 billion to $4.2 billion. I asked for that increase from what I had inherited. We had our conversation. What I didn\u2019t give people who were the inside watchers was blow after blow of criticism of each other. I think people used to say, oh, you know, now it was this person, this and this. I didn\u2019t do that intentionally because that doesn\u2019t restore people\u2019s faith in government. When you\u2019re out there taking shots at each other and criticizing and just trying to score political points, it, it takes away the face. I didn\u2019t do that. So I put together a budget that is extraordinary.\nMara Gay: Well, I think the question isn\u2019t really about the end result of the budget. The question is about the process and the transparency. So, for example, there was no gaggle of news reporters able to ask questions about the budget. And as you know, some of the most controversial pieces of the budget come together at the last minute. So why not commit to just kind of reintroducing some of the kinds of transparency measures around that, you know, budget season that would make the budget process more transparent in New York rather than a fly by night at the end of the budget session, as it has always been.\nThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s always been this big ugly where people just put everything at the end. I feel like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. At the end of session, where human nature is, you put out ideas. I started meeting with the leadership early in March, you know, just saying, \u201cHey, how are we going to get there?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to just make it a political battle in the press. I just, I chose not to, because I wanted to be able to have conversations with the two of them and then make some decisions and put it out there afterward. We can always assess the approach we took. This is my first budget and doing it to scale.\nI do think that there was a lot of mistrust because they had so, been so conditioned to a certain process, and I had to show them that I really was treating them like partners. We had $2 billion extra in Covid money that I absolutely could have put toward anything I wanted to. And I said, \u201cNo, you tell me what you want.\u201d So we put more money toward the ERAP rent relief program after getting our $2 billion out. We\u2019ve added another $800 million. We put in more money for utility, for utilities. I wanted to base it on their priorities so they would have buy-in. I said, \u201cThis is a shared document. This is not just the governor\u2019s budget and I\u2019m going to beat you into submission.\u201d We did it differently. And yes, we can talk next year about how to, you know, open it up more.\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of days where we \u2014 I was sick. I don\u2019t know how many days I was without doing a gag line. I know that was frustrating. Also, my entire team had Covid. Everybody on my budget negotiation team were all working remotely. It was tough. I mean, they were dropping like flies. So it was a challenge. I hope to not have that next year. To answer your question, yeah, I understand the question. I look at the results. The results are exceptional. This is an exceptional budget.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I\u2019m concerned we haven\u2019t hit upon two very critical issues. The first of which is public safety right now in the state, at least the perception that crime has risen here in the city and elsewhere. Can you talk a little bit about what you can do right now in order to help that? And then I want to also talk about the M.T.A. as well.\nSure. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of talk about bail reform. I have stood behind reform from Day 1. I said we had an injustice, a system of injustice where two people accused of the same offense, one Black, usually one white. And the white kid, maybe from more affluent means. Parents have money; they post bail. They\u2019re back out at school. They\u2019re back at their jobs. They show up at trial. They have a good lawyer, and they\u2019re off.\nYoung Black gentleman, kid, teenager, who doesn\u2019t have that support? They\u2019re going to Rikers. They\u2019re going to Rikers. I will say that was wrong for the rest of my life. So I never said anything needed to be changed based on changing that fundamental premise, but what happened is that we had to look at this. A lot of offenses were taken out of consideration for bail, and some of them were gun offenses. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who thinks it\u2019s OK that someone could walk on a schoolyard and have a gun. Which was one of those offenses that if there was not, you know, prior history, that person goes before a judge. They\u2019re back out on the street.\nI think that I need to insert some comments. There are areas where I don\u2019t even know that the legislators knew exactly where it had been. Repeat offenders, for example. The little grocery stores. I walked to some, and it was a little bodega in the Bronx. And he said, I just leave my grocery store \u2014 I leave the cash drawer open every day because they\u2019re going to come in and take the money. Day after day and they\u2019re back to us. So we had to do something.\nHate crimes. Hate crimes have been excluded. We have such a rise in Asian hate crimes and antisemitism. And there\u2019s a fear out there. I go to these \u2014 all the time, they\u2019re just generally, one\u2019s too afraid to walk the streets because someone\u2019s going to come and harm them, assault them physically, verbally. So we made a few changes. We dealt with repeat offenders, but that was not the whole problem.\nThe problem is the guns on the streets. And let\u2019s just acknowledge that, that that access to guns, that pipelines of gunsMany guns are trafficked from Southern states, where gun laws are less restrictive, to Northeastern states, where gun laws are more restrictive, along I-95, which law enforcement officials have nicknamed the Iron Pipeline. that is still coming here is one that I started addressing way before we had the Buffalo massacre or before Texas. I assembled a team to work on this last January. And we\u2019re making progress. We have over 4,000 guns statewide that have been confiscated, including 250 ghost guns, which were legal up until I signed a bill outlawing them. So we have found more areas where there\u2019s gaps in our laws. They need to be tighter. Twenty-one-year-olds should not be buying an AR \u2014 or, I\u2019m sorry, an 18-year-old should not be able to buy an AR-15, and they won\u2019t be at the end of this week. I\u2019m telling you right now: I\u2019m going to get that through. I\u2019m going to get that through.\nNick Fox: How do you deal with the M.T.A. beyond just crime reduction? As you mentioned, it\u2019s down about 40 percent. Ridership revenue is down. It\u2019s being kept afloat by federal money now. What happens when the federal money is gone and you need to do the sort of repairs that have been delayed for years and years? And increase ridership?\nThat\u2019s a challenge we have. That is a challenge. It was a lot easier before the pandemic, when ridership was up. We had a plan for congestion pricing to help bring in a steady stream of income to support it. We\u2019re still waiting for the federal government, you know, they keep throwing more barriers in front of us right now. And I\u2019m going to be announcing something on how we\u2019re trying to get around that shortly.\nBut, yes, we have to have a steady revenue source. I\u2019m going to have to have the state be helping the M.T.A. I mean, this is not something that we can let fail. I have to stick with the very ambitious capital plan, not taking our foot off the pedal there, because for people to come back, I have to offer them a world-class experience. New Yorkers deserve a world-class transportation experience. They don\u2019t get that right now.\nEven something like Penn Station. I mean, that\u2019s a hellhole. It should not exist in a city like this. So I\u2019m taking it on. We\u2019ll find the resources. We\u2019ll get it done. But I\u2019m not going to use this as an excuse right now to say, \u201cWell, times are tough. The ridership\u2019s down. Let\u2019s just put the M.T.A. investments over here. We\u2019ll do it the next decade.\u201d We\u2019ve done that for too long. So I\u2019m leaning into infrastructure, including the M.T.A. investments. And we have to inspire people to come back. I take the subway a lot, and I talk to people. I thank them for being out there, and you know, there\u2019s a lot of people who just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the experience they deserve, and they\u2019re absolutely right.\nNick Fox: How will you increase safety in the subway system?\nLooking back, it was January, first week of Eric Adams\u2019s term. We went down to the subways together. We talked about restoring safety, dealing with the humanitarian crisis of people feeling like that\u2019s where they have to live, because society has not offered them a better home. The homelessness problem. So we talked about the state working with the city.\nNow that was a radical announcement. Still is whenever I do this. I said, \u201cCity\u2019s responsible for public safety on the subways, but I oversee the subway. So why aren\u2019t we working together?\u201d Why aren\u2019t I bringing in support teams to help people who are homeless and to give them, you know, an alternative and not just warehousing them in, in \u2014 the shelters are just not acceptable. We need to fix the shelters but also mental health.\nThere\u2019s a whole mental health side of this on the homeless side, but also the overall safety. I\u2019ve said, if you need more people from the M.T.A., police will be helping you. I don\u2019t want to make a militarized zone. I want people to feel comfortable there. But if we need more surveillance cameras that work, we have a lot more to do. He\u2019s proposed, you know, metal detectors. I will entertain any idea, but it has to be one that\u2019s actually going to work. We have to test that as well.\nNick Fox: What about police on trains?\nPolice on trains? I think that that gives people comfort. They see, you know, undercover \u2014 if there\u2019s undercover people, just people embedded in, they can deal with other problems, too. Other things have happened, you know. So I\u2019m just trying to find \u2014\nNick Fox: Is that happening?\nN.Y.P.D. \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re doing undercover.\nNick Fox: Is the state providing more officers?\nNo, we\u2019re \u2014 we have offered to the city that we\u2019ll help you. Their police force is much larger than our M.T.A. force.\nNick Fox: I understand.\nBut I\u2019ve offered from \u2014 I said, you tell me you need help, we\u2019ll be down there with you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Lauren, do you want to ask about reproductive rights?\nLauren Kelley: Yes. Hi, Governor.\nHi, Lauren.\nLauren Kelley: Hi. So I know you\u2019ve already said that you\u2019ll release $35 million in emergency funds, if and when Roe v. Wade is overturned. I was wondering if you could speak to us a little bit about the other priorities that you see for shoring up New York, whether it\u2019s through legislation or whatnot, to prepare for the massive influx of patients that we\u2019re likely to see, likely to see not just short term but really sort of for the long haul.\nI\u2019m already releasing that $35 million because we are already experiencing increase in people coming from other states. For example, western New York. Their Planned Parenthood is overwhelmed right now. They have people coming in from Ohio [inaudible] three hours from Buffalo is, is Cleveland. So we already have that situation. So I wanted to not wait but also bolster up their ability to expand their space, hire people, not wait till the last minute. So we\u2019ve already undertaken.\nThe other thing we have to do is protect the providers in New York who do serve someone from out of state. I don\u2019t want these crazy laws from Texas where some vigilante nut case can come to New York and, you know, file lawsuits against our providers. I\u2019m taking action now in our legislation to protect our providers so they don\u2019t have that chilling effect on their ability to provide these services, because we are going to be a beacon for the rest of the nation. I stood up there and said that we are a safe harbor.\nAnd it\u2019s part of our legacy is, you know, protecting these rights, three years before Roe v. Wade or even now. So it\u2019s resources. It\u2019s legally protecting. It\u2019s also enshrining these rights in the New York State Constitution. And we talked about this for years, and everybody said: Well, why do you even have to have the Reproductive Health Act enacted into law in New York? I mean, no one will ever come and take away these rights. I\u2019m sorry. They are, the Supreme Court has changed it. But also, we won\u2019t go into politics, but I guess this is a political endorsement. But, you know, we have someone running for governor who\u2019s saying that he would make sure that his health commissioner is pro-life. It would open his door to all the pro-life advocates. That\u2019s why I have to be successful. I have to be the firewall against that.\nWe also have to make sure that, that people feel safe, that we protect them. And security grants. We have to have more security for the facilities. I mean, I come from the town where Dr. Barnett SlepianIn 1998, Dr. Slepian, one of three doctors who provided abortions in the Buffalo area, was killed by a sniper\u2019s bullet in his home. The Times reported that \u201che had endured years of picketing and harassment, apparently moving his family into a new home in a quiet, affluent subdivision two years ago in hope of avoiding protesters.\u201d was gunned down in his home. And the people who live down the hall from me in my condo is a doctor and a nurse who provided abortions to people before it was legal. And we don\u2019t want to go back to that era where people are now fearful for their lives. Not just in New York. I\u2019m worried about the rest of the country. Gosh, I do. I could protect New Yorkers, but it pains me as a woman and as a woman governor to know that people in other states will not have the same rights as women in my state.\nLauren Kelley: Just a really quick follow-up to that. The effort to enter abortion rights in the New York State Constitution \u2014 what\u2019s the latest on that? How are things looking on that front?\nWell, there\u2019s been an ongoing debate between different legislators about how much should go into that amendment, what other rights should be protected. You know, do we include disability rights and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community? There are some who wanted it years ago to just model after the Equal Rights Amendment and just talk about gender. There are others who want to make it more expansive. So that\u2019s the conversation that\u2019s going now.\nThe governor doesn\u2019t actually vote on a constitutional amendment. They pass it. It goes to the voters. I mean, they pass it two consecutive sessions, and then it goes to the voters. But I\u2019ve weighed in strong, saying, \u201cGet something done. Stop talking about this.\u201d You know, we never dreamed we\u2019d get this close to the edge of losing these rights. And now we are.\nJyoti Thottam: Yeah. So you\u2019ve mentioned Buffalo a few times, understandably, in this conversation. That shooting there definitely showed the whole world that domestic extremism is a presence here in New York State. What are you doing to address that?\nTwo approaches. One is addressing how the radicalization occurred of an 18-year-old sitting in Conklin, N.Y., which is about as rural as it gets. And I have asked the attorney general, and we\u2019re looking at legislation that\u2019ll actually stand up a task force within the attorney general\u2019s office, to be monitoring social media. Trying to identify the threats and actually making threats illegal. That\u2019s another piece of legislation that I started looking at late last night. To do we can to put the companies on notice. I can\u2019t legally stop you because of Section 230 in the federal law, but I\u2019m going to find a way to make you be more responsible than you have been. I can\u2019t legally make you respond. I\u2019m going to make you be more responsible, and we\u2019re going to find a way to do that. So there\u2019s a part of it.\nWhen there\u2019s that hate speech, these white supremacist manifestoes. The replacement theory that\u2019s shared and shared, from what happened in New Zealand to Christchurch all the way to what happens in Buffalo. There\u2019s that element because you can have that hate in your heart and sit in your basement and not act on it. OK. As I said in church on Sunday, I said, \u201cGod will deal with you.\u201d But you can\u2019t hurt somebody. I said, \u201cOnce you also take that and have access to an AR-15 legally as an 18-year-old in the State of New York\u201d \u2014 not high-capacity magazine, which you can drive over 10 minutes, and he lives 10 minutes from the Pennsylvania border, and add on the high-capacity magazine intended for the battlefields of Afghanistan, where I once visited \u2014 \u201cnow we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d That has to stop. That\u2019s the part we have control over.\nMy gun interdiction task force state police, he said: I don\u2019t need you looking at people, you know, I\u2019d rather you stop going after the speeders so much. Go after the guys loading up their trucks in Pennsylvania with guns and bringing them to the Bronx or to Brooklyn. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\nSo two approaches: how we deal with the radicalization side of it and the responsibility of social media platforms and how law enforcement needs to be identifying the threats in advance, but also the access to guns.\nJyoti Thottam: So the law enforcement piece \u2014 do you think that law enforcement in New York state is treating domestic extremism appropriately, as a priority? What are they doing to coordinate?\nThey are now. They are now.\nMara Gay: What is the measure of that?\nUnder the past administration, we had one person in the state police department monitoring social media. I\u2019m building up a team. I\u2019m hiring the best. I\u2019m hiring the best. We\u2019re standing up a task force on that. We are doing a lot. I\u2019m taking this very seriously.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time. It occurs to me through this conversation that your to-do list is quite long. There are many times that you said, \u201cI want to do this.\u201d How concerned are you that there\u2019s going to be an economic recession, and what have you done to prepare the state for that?\nI\u2019ll tell you, that\u2019s an excellent question, because as we are looking at this year, where I had my first budget, I wanted to invest money in areas that had not been invested in properly. Foundation aid, education, health care, child care, $7 billion for health careMs. Hochul\u2019s first budget includes $7 billion in child care funding for New York families. to help struggling families. I wanted to get all that done. But there was also pressure to take every dollar of money we had and spend it this year and also have out-year expenses.\nI couldn\u2019t do that because this year, I said \u2014 back at the end of the year, I said, I don\u2019t know how long the stock markets will be strong. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to have high-net-worth people contributing to our tax base. I also don\u2019t \u2014 cannot count on Washington to give us any more money. This was before they said no to the, the CARES Act.\nSo all three of those turned out to be right \u2014 what I said I could not count on and build a budget around in January. When everybody wanted me to spend more, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to build up our reserves.\u201d When I took over this position, we had 4 percent of reserves in the state budget. I had done 14 municipal budgets. We always made sure we had 15 percent. That\u2019s a commonly accepted practice: 15 percent reserves for a rainy day or a blizzard day, which is where I come from.\nI have invested $5 billion extra, 2022. I\u2019ll be putting more into 2023. I\u2019m going to build it up to 15 percent. So at least we can be self-reliant and I don\u2019t have to wait on if we have another pandemic and another hurricane at the same time and the federal government says we\u2019re done with that, especially, see, if the leadership changes in the House and the Senate. That\u2019s the world I lived in when I was in Congress a decade ago.\nThat\u2019s when Superstorm Sandy hit, and the Republicans in the House and Senate would not send money to New York until we\u2019ve had cutbacks everywhere else, even though we didn\u2019t do that during Katrina. I\u2019ve lived long enough to see all the bad scenarios. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m always prepared.\nSo we\u2019ll have the ability to take care of ourselves. I also made sure that a lot of our Covid spending was this year only, that we didn\u2019t get ourselves trapped into out year. So I don\u2019t have out-year gaps from now to 2027. That was very important to me, to have a very progressive budget, one that was fiscally responsible, because I cannot turn back to New York and say, \u201cWell, I have to go raise your taxes now. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nWe can get this right if we\u2019re thoughtful about it and don\u2019t succumb to a lot of pressure to do things. And I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m immune to. I just have this clarity of purpose as a leader in this state to know what has to be done, find a path to get it done, not be dissuaded by all the other voices that are out there. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve had to perfect in the last nine months as governor.\nKathleen Kingsbury: All right, I think we\u2019re just out of time. Thank you so much for being here. We really appreciate it.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

He was a Nassau County executive and a mayor of his hometown, Glen Cove, on Long Island Sound.\nThis interview with Mr. Suozzi was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times on May 23.\nRead the board\u2019s endorsement for the Democratic gubernatorial primary here.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So we\u2019re just going to launch into questions, if that works for you.\nI would like to say a couple of things first, if I can.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You have one minute.\nWow. So I\u2019m a lifelong Democrat. I was the environmentalist of the year for the New York League of Conservation Voters. I was the person of the year for the New York Immigration Coalition. I have a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood. I have a 100 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign. I have an F rating from the N.R.A. I\u2019m the chair of the labor caucus in Congress,The House\u2019s Labor Caucus was formed in 2020 to help expand union power for American workers. It has 120 members and six co-chairs, including Mr. Suozzi. and I\u2019ve been getting elected over \u2014 in, in difficult areas for Democrats over many, many years.\nAnd I was very influenced by The New York Times in a couple different things: Your editorial board editorial on Nov. 4 had a very big impact on me and persuaded me to do one thing, that persuaded me to run for governor, because of the fact that the Democrats need to recognize the politics of what we\u2019re doing.\nOK, this is the November \u2014 for the people on the screen \u2014 this is the Nov. 4, 2021, editorial by The New York Times.Last fall, Virginia Republicans swept statewide offices, shifting the state to the right and revealing the broader Democratic Party\u2019s weaknesses ahead of the midterms. The board wrote that Democrats badly needed to energize voters with moderate policies as they have before.\nKathleen Kingsbury: It\u2019s the editorial in wake of the Virginia election.\n\u201cDemocrats Deny Political Reality at Their Own Peril.\u201d And what\u2019s needed is an honest conversation with the Democratic Party. The results of Virginia, the results in New Jersey, Bill Clinton\u2019s mantra.\nWe better stop knocking bipartisan deals. We have to look at many blue enclaves like Buffalo, where I got involved in.\nI actually went up to Buffalo based upon something else in The New York Times, which was written by Ezra Klein about David Shor\u2019s polling. And it talked about how defunding the police and other Democratic messages are killing the Democratic Party. And I\u2019m the only Democrat in New York State who went up to campaign for Byron Brown against India Walton after she had won the Democratic primary, even though Kathy Hochul\u2019s from Buffalo, did not get involved in that race. Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and a whole bunch of others campaigned for India Walton, even though she was declared socialist in that campaign.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Well, you\u2019re getting into one of my first questions. In light of what we see as a national crisis around democracy, how will you rebuild trust? How will you rebuild voter trust in government and the democratic process in New York State after what has been a long list of failures on Covid but also corruption scandals?\nYeah, the most important thing we need to do is listen to what the people want and give them \u2014 the purpose of democracy is supposed to be that the elected officials represent the people and you need to do what the people want. That doesn\u2019t happen in New York State.\nIt hasn\u2019t happened for 30 years because it\u2019s an insider\u2019s game and everybody keeps on getting re-elected, no matter what they do. And the only way people lose their jobs is by scandal, whether it\u2019s Cuomo or Spitzer or Paterson or it\u2019s Alan Hevesi or it\u2019s Eric Schneiderman or it\u2019s Dean Skelos or it\u2019s Joe Bruno or Sheldon Silver or Brian BenjaminIn April, Brian Benjamin, Ms. Hochul\u2019s running mate and lieutenant governor, resigned after being arrested and charged with bribery and fraud. Ms. Hochul appointed him despite potential concerns about his use of campaign funds and suspicious donations while he was a state senator that were raised in his background check. or it\u2019s dozens of other lesser figures.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Quite a list.\nAnd we were declared the most corrupt state in the United States of America by The Washington Post last August.\nAnd Kathy Hochul has continued that trend, doing the stuff that your paper talks against all the time. She raised $20 million in a shorter period of time \u2014 more money than Cuomo ever did or Spitzer ever did or Pataki ever did. And she didn\u2019t get it because she\u2019s inspired people.\nPeople are not inspired by the Buffalo Bills deal. They\u2019re not inspired by Brian Benjamin. They\u2019re not inspired by the most secretive budget process in New York State in 30 years, according to Blair Horner, who\u2019s been up there for 30 years. Eleanor knows Blair Horner well, I\u2019m sure. Every other outside observer said this was the most secretive budget process in 30 years.\nThey\u2019re not inspired by the fact that she\u2019s not even making crime a priority. Forget about what I think we should do or what she thinks we should do or anybody thinks we should do. Let\u2019s at least make it a priority and talk about it. But it\u2019s not even a priority for her.\nShe didn\u2019t even talk about it even after the cops were killed in New York City and she laid out a plan \u2014 and it\u2019s not even a plan; it\u2019s a half-baked press release she did 10 days before the budget was due \u2014 and she leaked it,In a March statement to City & State New York, a spokesperson for Ms. Hochul denied releasing the public safety plan to The New York Post. and she told everybody: I\u2019m not going to talk about it. I\u2019m not going to negotiate in public.\nIt\u2019s been a secretive insider game the way it\u2019s always been in Albany. And we need competition, and we need The New York Times to help make this race more competitive by endorsing Tom Suozzi.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Mara, do you want to jump in?\nMara Gay: We had this horrific killing yesterday in which a 48-year-old man was shot to death on a Q train. What would you do as governor right now to help make the subways safer? Obviously, that\u2019s partially a city responsibility, for the most part \u2014\nIt\u2019s my No. 1 priority.\nMara Gay: What would you do?\nI have a 15-point crime intervention and prevention plan that I\u2019ve talked about every single day. It\u2019s not like Fox News crime prevention, OK?\nIt\u2019s giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness. And couple that with technology using a CompStat for justice proposed by a Yale professor, Phillip Atiba Goff, that suggests that we should use statistics to monitor the behavior of police officers the way we monitor the behavior of criminals. Use that \u2014 I\u2019m proposing, you can say this \u2014 use it for judges as well to monitor their behavior.\nMartin Luther King used to say, you can\u2019t legislate morality, but you can regulate behavior.\nUse statistics: It\u2019s accepted by the police through CompStat. Use statistics. How often is this police officer using use of force? Is he using it in particular neighborhoods? How often is this judge remanding somebody? What kind of bail are they giving? Use statistics to analyze the behavior and look for those outliers that are ruining the reputation of law enforcement and hold them accountable for their bad behavior.\nBut my 15-point plan is not just about intervention \u2014 all the stuff that the mayor is talking about that I support 100 percent. I endorsed the mayor very early. I campaigned for the mayor. I raised money for the mayor. The mayor asked me to be his deputy mayor. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be your deputy mayor. I\u2019m running for governor. I can help you more as governor than I can as deputy mayor. And help New York City more.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s a 15-point plan that includes intervention \u2014 stuff right now, stuff that I did as Nassau County executive, when I ran the 12th-largest police department of America, bigger than Detroit or Boston. I had the lowest crime rate in the United States of America when I left \u2014 to prevention, long-term prevention, the thing that I\u2019m most passionate about, that I \u2014 one of the reasons I really want to be the governor of New York State is to take all of our health and human services and bring them into our schools. Because the problems that exist in our schools \u2014 we already spend more per student than any state in the United States of America. Our results are below average. We need to take social services, health, mental health, veterans, seniors, youth, physically challenged, drug and alcohol, every federally funded, state funded, locally funded and not for profit and bring them into our schools.\nSo when you look at test scores for third grade, kids in the good school district and kids in the average school districts are pretty similar in third grade. But by eighth grade, kids in a good school district are skyrocketing. The kids in average school districts have fallen off the face of the earth. All the problems of life are emerging at that time.\nThe teachers can\u2019t deal with the volume of problems. It\u2019s impossible in average school districts. Good school districts, you know, they got private health insurance. They got their families. They got school psychologists, school guidance counselor, school social worker. They can help them deal with their volume of problems. But if you\u2019re in the Roosevelt school district or some of the New York City school districts or the Buffalo school district, 70 percent of the kids bring a problem with them. You can never get the resources to fight \u2014 do more programs. We have to change the mind-set and take our existing programs and bring them into our schools so that when a kid has a problem, the teacher says, \u201cBoy, this kid is falling asleep and getting in fights. They\u2019re being disrespectful. Their life is falling apart. Let\u2019s bring in a social worker to help navigate the bureaucracy with the existing programs that exist all over the place.\u201d\nBut right now, they\u2019re designed for somebody to show up at the window when they\u2019re an adult and they\u2019re in crisis and they got to get help now or that everything\u2019s over.\nBishop Desmond Tutu used to say \u2014 Eric Adams uses this line a lot \u2014 we spend a lifetime pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and stop them from falling in the river in the first place. We have to change the whole mentality of health and human services towards prevention.\nNick Fox: Do you think there\u2019s evidence that existing programs are underused?\nNo, I think that they\u2019re inefficient, and I think that they\u2019re spread out all over the place and they\u2019re designed for reaction, as opposed to prevention. And we have to change that mind-set. It\u2019s the same thing with health care, quite frankly. But this is for mental health and drugs and alcohol. Seventy-five percent of people in jail have a drug or alcohol \u2014 when they\u2019re at schools \u2026\nNick Fox: You\u2019re saying \u2014\nThe problem \u2014\nNick Fox: You\u2019re saying we don\u2019t need more resources in the school; we just need to reallocate resources, and I\u2019m saying, aren\u2019t those resources \u2014\nI didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t need more resources. I\u2019m all for increasing state aid and moving away from property taxes towards state aid \u2019cause property taxes are a regressive tax.\nBut the answer is not going to be just more spending, because we already have the highest taxes in America, highest state and local taxes in America, and we already spend more per student than any state in the United States of America.\nThere has to be a complete rethinking of taking our existing resources on the outside, floating out here in the ether very ineffectively and very inefficiently \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing this for 30 years \u2014 and bring them into the schools and stop the silo between education, health and human services and law enforcement and bring them together. \u2019Cause 75 percent of people who are in jail have a drug, alcohol or mental health problem. Fifty percent of people at Rikers IslandThe Times was unable to confirm this figure for incarcerated people at the Rikers Island jail complex. have a learning disability.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We have a whole list of questions for you. Lauren, do you want to jump in?\nLauren Kelley: Sure. Hi. Thanks for being here. So I wanted to ask about reproductive rights. You know, obviously, we are very likely headed into a post-Roe America. So I\u2019m curious what your plan is to protect New York in this coming future without Roe v. Wade, very likely. And specifically, if you have thought about a plan for the massive influx of patients that we\u2019re \u2014 that abortion clinics here in New York are very likely to see once abortion is banned in a number of red states.\nI would support what the governor is proposing right now, by putting more money into the programs and making that available to women who are trying to come to New York State. As I mentioned earlier I have a 100 percent rating from Planned Parenthood.\nI think that abortion must remain safe, legal and accessible. And I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure that New York State is a standard-bearer, as far as abortion rights and abortion access. I also think that New York State should be a standard-bearer, as far as trying to prevent unintended pregnancies by increasing education and contraception.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Binya?\nBinya Appelbaum: The New York area is \u2014 you\u2019re not going to be surprised by the topic of this question \u2014 one of the hardest places to find affordable housing in the United States. One big reason for that is that New York\u2019s suburbs have been extremely resistant to new development. What, if anything, do you think should change in order to make it possible to build more housing in counties like Nassau and Suffolk?\nSo, as The New York Times said in its 2016 endorsement of my congressional campaign in the general election, \u201cHe\u2019s been a national leader in the battle to limit urban sprawl and revitalize aging suburbs.\u201d\nAnd part of that was to create a concept called cool downtowns that I started talking about 20 years ago, which is about going up in our downtowns around our train stations, building apartments, building office, building restaurants, building shops, making the downtowns of places like Long Island much more attractive for young people and increasing transit-oriented development. We\u2019ve had some successes.\nIf you look at the Mineola train station on Long Island, if you look at Patchogue, if you look at my hometown in Glen Cove, if you look in Rockville Centre, if you look at Long Beach, if you look at Farmingdale, those things are starting to happen. It\u2019s a big fight.\nIt was a very difficult fight to start 20 years ago, when the Republicans campaigned against me saying, \u201cTom Suozzi wants to make Nassau County the sixth borough.\u201d And they attacked what I \u2014 the complete urbanization I was bringing to Nassau County.\nAnd I laid out a plan that said that: Listen, 95 percent, maybe even 99 percent of our landmass should stay the same. Single-family houses, parks, open spaces. But 1 percent of our landmass, we need to go up and build these cool downtowns, and we should be providing much more robust incentives for that to happen, because it\u2019ll be \u2014 you can\u2019t ram it down people\u2019s throats.\nThe governor proposed Hochul control, not local control, where she said it was mandated that you had to build accessory dwelling units. It would have been a revolution. And it was a revolution not only from Long Island and Westchester and other places throughout the rest of the state but also in parts of Queens and Staten Island and Brooklyn as well.\nSo we need to do a better job of persuading people as to why this will make people\u2019s lives better by attracting young people into communities that are aging out, by creating affordable housing for people, as well as expanding our tax base and making life more enjoyable and improving the quality of life. So I\u2019ve been working on this for a long time. I know it very, very well, and I\u2019m very excited to have the opportunity to try and affect that as governor.\nI really have some stuff I wanted to talk to you guys about.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re going to get to it.\nAlex Kingsbury: We have stuff we want to talk to you about, too.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We have plenty of time.\nOK.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Alex?\nAlex Kingsbury: Yeah. In the wake of this shooting up in Buffalo, I wanted to ask if you\u2019ve thought at all about what the state can do about domestic extremism, white nationalist terrorism and the ideologies that are motivating in that sense.\nA lot of it has to do with the conversations that we\u2019re having. You know, I\u2019m the vice chairman of a group called the Problem Solvers Caucus in Congress, 29 Democrats and Republicans who meet regularly to try and find common ground. We need to be encouraging those Republicans, quite frankly, to stand up to their party, to help us with this issue, because everybody is so \u2014 under Trump right now. We need to actually be building partnerships and building trust, which is very difficult to do in this environment between Democrats and Republicans that care about their country and that see this as a scourge on the nation.\nCan I just say, one thing specifically related to Buffalo is that we have \u2014 three years ago, we passed a law in New York State called a red-flag law. One of my 15 points in my crime prevention and intervention plan is that we never implemented it.New York State\u2019s red-flag law has been in effect since 2019. Although it\u2019s not well known in many parts of the state, judges in some counties have used it to take guns away from people who appear to pose a threat to themselves or others. In Suffolk County, judges have used the law to seize more than 160 guns. We should be out selling the red-flag law. It\u2019s one of the best laws in the country.\nWe should be \u2014 there\u2019s such a long journey between making a speech and passing a law and implementing something. I\u2019m good at running government. I know how to get things done in government. And the red-flag law \u2014 I said back in January after the two cops were shot, because the mother was talking about how, my son has had these problems all these years. He\u2019s been in and out of institutions.In January, a gunman shot and killed two New York City police officers in Harlem. The officers were responding to a call about a domestic incident involving the gunman, Lashawn McNeil, and his mother, who said that her son\u2019s mental condition was \u201cvery distorted.\u201d It is not clear whether he spent time in and out of institutions. If she knew there was a red-flag law and she knew he had a gun, she could have had the gun taken away from him. Because under the red-flag law, family members, social workers, cops, teachers can say, go to the courts and say: Listen, this person shouldn\u2019t have a gun. Take this person\u2019s gun away from them.\nAnd in the case of this guy that did this awful racist massacre up in Buffalo, the cops knew about it. His teachers knew about it. He was in a mental institution for a day and a half. And his family probably knew about it. And he was the prime candidate for somebody who should have had his guns taken away from him.\nI\u2019ve talked to many cops who talk about \u2014 before the red-flag law \u2014 how they would go into a domestic disturbance or something going on in somebody\u2019s house and they\u2019d see this crazy person or they\u2019d see someone with a drug and alcohol problem who had these guns right there in the house and they\u2019d take them away and they had to give them back because no crime had been committed. The red-flag law was a way for them to take guns away from people. But we haven\u2019t implemented it.\nI was so angry when the governor made such a big deal about Washington, D.C., about need for gun control and the need to attack gun violence at the \u2014 they should be ashamed of themselves, they said \u2014 she said, after Sandy Hook. She was in Congress in 2011, 2012. She was endorsed by the N.R.A. She had a 100 percent rating from the N.R.A. right at the same time that Sandy Hook took place. And she said Congress should be ashamed, and she\u2019s pushing it off over there, when right in front of her is the red-flag law that we did. It didn\u2019t escape her lips, the word \u201cred-flag law,\u201d until I did a press conference that morning, and she brought it up as an afterthought at her press conference with a B.S. executive order.\nNick Fox: If, in this case, the cops seemed to have ignored the red-flag law, what more do you think needs to be done?\nThe state police need to be trained on the red-flag law. They\u2019re the ones who are investigating. The teachers need to be educated. The administrators need to be educated. The mental health experts need to be. The public needs to be educated. There are family members right now who are living in fear at their homes with some person who\u2019s mentally unstable or has a drug and alcohol problem, and they have a gun in the house, and they know it\u2019s a problem. Let them know that there\u2019s a way to deal with this.\nHow can it be that after this massacre took place, this wasn\u2019t \u2014 the governor wasn\u2019t talking it about every single day to try and promote the red-flag law? Because she hadn\u2019t done it, and she didn\u2019t want to admit that she hadn\u2019t done it. So instead, she\u2019s made it all about Washington, D.C. We \u2014 yes, Washington, D.C., needs to be fixed. But it\u2019s the height of hypocrisy that when she was in Washington, she had a 100 percent rating, an A rating, from the N.R.A. And she was boasting about the fact that she was endorsed by the N.R.A.\nJyoti Thottam: Can I follow up on the first part of Alex\u2019s question, on domestic extremism? How would you address that part of the challenge here? Building bridges with Republicans? What \u2014\nI think a lot of it just has to do with basic education of people. I mean, there has to be a constant \u2014 leadership matters. And what the leaders talk about matters. What the governor of New York talks about matter, and how they talk about it matters.\nYou know, if you read the New York Times editorial from Nov. 4 of last year or David Shor\u2019s article from October \u2014 I\u2019m sorry, Ezra Klein\u2019s article about David Shor \u2014 how we talk about things really matters in politics. It really matters as far as being leaders. And if it\u2019s just the constant attacking, attacking, attacking, people are just going to shut down. They don\u2019t even listen. They don\u2019t even open up their minds.\nAnd there\u2019s a major educational gap that exists in America. Sixty percent of Americans, 66 percent of New Yorkers, do not graduate from college.Nearly 40 percent of Americans age 25 or older have a bachelor\u2019s degree, a Pew analysis found. In New York City, about 40 percent in that age group have a bachelor\u2019s or postgraduate degree, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. They are not like the people in this room or on this call. And we have to start talking to them in language that they understand.\nWhen Tom Suozzi is campaigning on crime and taxes and affordability, I\u2019m trying to speak to the people about the issues that they care about. Ninety-one percent of New Yorkers say that crime is a serious or very serious issue. Sixty-eight percent of New Yorkers say that Kathy Hochul is failing on crime, failing on the economy. So she\u2019s not even talking about the issues. And people say this is their No. 1 issue.\nIf you want to get the trust of the people and tell them that this extremism, extremism is happening and domestic terrorism is happening, they have to trust their leaders to speak to them about it. If it\u2019s just me attacking Donald Trump every day and attacking the Republicans every day, I\u2019m not \u2014 they\u2019re not even going to listen to me. Because it\u2019s the same old shit that they hear every day. Oh, I\u2019m on the record. There we go again, Pat Healy.\nPatrick Healy: Watch it. Got to watch it.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Nick?\nNick Fox: M.T.A. ridership has plummeted. M.T.A. revenue has plummeted. Federal funding has kept it afloat. That\u2019s going to end soon. How do you increase ridership? How do you increase revenue? And how do you continue to make the improvements that need to be done after decades of neglect?\nYou have to reduce crime. People are afraid to take the subway. Crime must be reduced. The idea that a guy got shot on a Sunday morning, yesterday, on his way to work, is terrifying to people.\nI was out campaigning all day in Queens on Saturday and the Bronx on Sunday. Everywhere I went, people were saying: The Democrats, you Democrats, you\u2019re not doing anything about crime. People are afraid to take the subway. We have to reduce crime in the subway. People have to feel safe. Leaders have to be taking the subway and showing people that it\u2019s safe. But right now, it\u2019s not credible, because it\u2019s not.\nEleanor Randolph: How do you make it safe?\nYou have to make it safe by giving the mayor what he\u2019s asking for, which is to address the bail reform problem that we have in the state.\nBy doing my 15-point crime intervention and prevention plan, which goes everywhere from giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness to red-flag laws to helping people who have mental health issues to doing prevention long term for the schools. That\u2019s going to take a lot longer time to address. But it\u2019s a [inaudible].\nWhat I would do as the governor of New York State, if I was elected governor of New York State, maybe even if I won the primary, I could do this. If I tried to do it now, nobody would come. But if I was \u2014 won the Democratic primary, I\u2019d have a meeting with 100 people in the room. I\u2019d have the mayors, I\u2019d have the police commissioners, I\u2019d have the judiciary, I\u2019d have the mental health experts, I\u2019d have the legislative leaders, I\u2019d have the parole and probation, I\u2019d have education experts, I\u2019d have community activists, and we\u2019d have a 100-person meeting. And I\u2019ve done these meetings my whole career.\nAnd I\u2019d say, \u201cListen, we\u2019re all against crime. We all want to make the subways safe. Nobody\u2019s for crime. Nobody\u2019s for the subways not being safe.\u201d\nSome people say: Well, we have \u2014 the biggest focus has got to be protecting Black and brown people that have been treated so badly by the injustices of our systems. And other people are saying: Lock them up, lock them up, lock them up.\nThe answer is somewhere taking both of these ideas together and finding a comprehensive plan. And then the job of a leader is to go sell that plan, sell it to the public and then sell it to the legislature. And if the legislature won\u2019t make a deal with you, then offer them something and say: I\u2019ll give it to you if that.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t work then do FixAlbany.com and defeat people who will not listen to what the people want and kick people out of office. So I\u2019m referencing FixAlbany.com because when I was a county executive in Nassau County, Shelly Silver and Joe Bruno wouldn\u2019t give us a cap on Medicaid. And it was killing the counties. It was killing the city in New York. It cost us hundreds of billions of dollars a year.\nAnd I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to defeat a Democrat in the Assembly. I\u2019m going to defeat a Republican in the State Senate until they start listening to us.\u201d And I defeated the Democrat in the Assembly, defeated David Sidikman and Chuck Lavine, and I defeated Nancy Larraine Hoffmann up in the upstate and Syracuse area with David Valesky. And I became the president of the New York State County Executives Association. And Shelly Silver and Joe Bruno gave us what we were looking for. So I know how to push things over the finish line with politics.\nKathleen Kingsbury: I wanted to push back a little bit because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in this room that disagrees with you that crime is a major issue. Safety is a major issue in the New York City subway right now. But the subway issues run much deeper than that. It\u2019s making sure the train runs on time \u2014\nSo I was the New York City \u2014 I was at the N.Y.U. Rudin Center Person of the Year for when I was the chairman of the New York State \u2014 what\u2019s it called now? N.Y.M.T.C., New York Metropolitan Transportation Council \u2014 I understand transportation issues, regional issues very, very well. I transformed how N.Y.M.T.C. worked [inaudible] the way it was before. Stupid bureaucracy, the politicians didn\u2019t know what was going on.\nBut I got everybody to work together throughout the entire region on transportation when I was the county executive in Nassau County. In Congress, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal, the only big bipartisan deal that has happened in Congress over the past many, many years was negotiated, the framework of it was negotiated by the Problem Solvers Caucus, of which I\u2019m the vice chairman of. I went to a meeting down in Maryland with about 20 different members of Congress, about 10 different senators, a few governors. We laid out the framework for that $1.2 trillion deal. And that was, that was bipartisan.\nMitch McConnell voted for it. That guy doesn\u2019t vote for anything, OK? He voted for it.\nAnd then, you know as part of the subject of your editorial is how it got stuck with the Democrats fighting amongst themselves, and it didn\u2019t happen until after the election, which killed us because we didn\u2019t deal with it. So there\u2019s going to be enormous amounts of money coming in for infrastructure, for the M.T.A., for mass transit that I fought for, as well as the rest of the New York delegation fought for to be included in there. So that\u2019s a very important thing.\nI believe in congestion pricing. I ran on congestion pricing in 2006, when I ran for governor against Eliot Spitzer. I got killed by it. It was before Bloomberg even talked about congestion pricing. I think that right now it should not be implemented within the next year or so. It\u2019s just not going to be, anyway, because of the stupid bureaucracy you have to go through. But people are suffering so much right now from cost that it shouldn\u2019t happen right now. But it should happen in, in about a year or so, assuming that things are better financially for people.\nNick Fox: Do you think New York State needs to change any sources of revenueThe M.T.A. is funded through a combination of fares, taxes and state aid. for the M.T.A.?\nI think there should be a dedicated source of revenue. I\u2019m not opposed to that. I don\u2019t have the answer for you right now. I got 15 people working for me on my campaign. I got 15 people working in [inaudible] County. I have 20,000 people working for me in the government. I can give you a more detailed answer. But I think we should have a dedicated source of revenue.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti?\nJyoti Thottam: Yes, Congressman, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of different issues, and I understand they\u2019re interconnected, but if you were to take office as governor, what would you make your first priority on Day 1?\nCrime. Crime is No. 1. Crime is No. 1. Taxes and affordability is No. 2. Helping our kids and troubled schools is No. 3, and corruption is No. 4.\nI\u2019ve said that since Day 1, and I challenge anybody to tell me what, Nancy with the \u2014 what\u2019s her name? \u2014 Kathy Hochul\u2019s priorities are regarding the State of New York. She\u2019s been governor for eight months. You tell me. You\u2019re The New York Times. You follow everything. You\u2019re the smartest people in the world.\nWhat is Kathy Hochul\u2019s priorities for the New York State? What is her big focus? The Buffalo Bills deal? To-go drinks?In April, Ms. Hochul legalized to-go alcoholic drinks if they are purchased with food. The measure will last for three years; after that, state legislators can decide if they want to make it permanent.\nJyoti Thottam: So crime is your No. 1 priority, just to follow up on that. A lot of the issues that you pointed to around crime and public safety, they\u2019re long-running issues. But clearly there\u2019s a worsening of public safety just in the last couple of years. So are you saying that bail reform would be the thing that would improve \u2014\nNo, I\u2019m saying that would be a 15 \u2014 I have a 15-point plan that I would use as my outline, but I would have a comprehensive meeting and bring all the players together and develop a more fulsome plan based upon the outline that I have that goes from everything from giving judges the discretion to consider dangerousness to helping change Kendra\u2019s Law \u2014 to give people ability to take mentally ill people who are not taking their medication and are a danger to themselves and others and get them the treatment that they need \u2014 to implementing the red-flag law to doing a thing called ShotSpottersShotSpotter is a gunshot detection system that uses surveillance and artificial technology. While police departments in a number of large cities in the country use the technology, its methodology and effectiveness have raised concerns among experts. and gun buyback programs to doing a more effective job with the interstate commission \u2014 to lobby for changes where there\u2019s trafficking of guns going on throughout the region \u2014 to working on mental health to working on schools to \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s no one answer to this. It\u2019s a comprehensive plan that has to be done.\nThe difference is, is that I\u2019m a proven executive. I\u2019m trained as a C.P.A. and an attorney. I was the mayor of a small city for eight years. I learned how to run government. I did my 10,000 hours. I turned the place around. I got national awards for this little, small city. I became the county executive in Nassau County, one of the biggest counties in the country, bigger than 11 states, bigger than Bill Clinton\u2019s budget was when he was governor of Arkansas, which he and I have joked about.\nAnd I know how to run government, and I would build a comprehensive plan, working in conjunction with the mayor of New York City, who I have a pretty good relationship with, to try and accomplish a reduction in crime.\nNick Fox: You haven\u2019t mentioned increasing the number of cops on the streets.\nI would support increasing the number of cops on streets, and I would help to direct funding towards that.\nEleanor Randolph: Can you just talk \u2014\nAnd I would try to increase the amount of community policing that\u2019s done. You know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve gotten away from community policing. Community policing, the concept of it is that the cops actually know the people in the community and the people in the community know the cops. And there\u2019s a level of trust that exists between the two. There is very \u2014 that trust has been completely destroyed. And we have to rebuild that trust.\nNick Fox: Why do you think it\u2019s been destroyed?\nBecause of abuses by cops that have been highly publicized by a marketing campaign against the cops. You know, some of it justified, a lot of it not justified. And because of \u2014 the cops are afraid of people, quite frankly.\nAlex Kingsbury: Does it have anything to do with cops not living in the areas that they patrol?For the past half-century, police officers in New York have been allowed to live in the five boroughs of the city or in the suburban counties of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange.\nI don\u2019t know the answer to that.\nEleanor Randolph: You\u2019ve talked about this a little bit, but what did you think about the relationship between Cuomo and de Blasio \u2014\nAwful.\nEleanor Randolph: And, yeah, we can talk about Cuomo as well. But how would your relationship with Adams be? I know you said that he \u2014 you liked him, he wanted to give you a job. But give us a genuine assessment about how you think he\u2019s doing and how you would be as governor, your relationship would be with him.\nI\u2019m excited about the idea of him being the mayor and me being the governor and us working together. I think that we would be a great team of people to work together. It would be a great symbol for people of us working together.\nI think that you know as well as anybody at this table what happens in Albany, with the governor or with any elected official, is that they dangle things over your head so that they control you. They try and control you. They\u2019re trying to control the mayor the way they try to control me as county executive, the way they\u2019ve tried to control everybody. He wants mayoral control. The governor says she\u2019s going to go for mayoral control, but they don\u2019t give him mayoral control.\nEleanor Randolph: Do you think he should have control?\nAbsolutely should have mayoral control \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\n\u2026 No question about it \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\nWhat\u2019s that?\nEleanor Randolph: Permanently?\nI would like to see it permanently, but I\u2019m willing to settle for less than permanently.\nI believe that the chief executive should be accountable, and it would be better to have, you know \u2014 my whole thing about no wrong door and tying together education, health and human services. This comes from my experience as county executive. I ran health and human services, but I didn\u2019t run the schools, so I couldn\u2019t bring my health and human services into the schools without a lot of cajoling and begging and pleading.\nBut if you had a chief executive, like the mayor of New York City or another of the big five,The \u201cbig five\u201d are New York State\u2019s five largest cities: New York City, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers. where they have control of both, you could integrate these services much more effectively. There\u2019s something else I want to say, and I forget now. The \u2014\nEleanor Randolph: Would you \u2014\nOh, so they try to control the mayor by not giving them what they want. So he wants bail reform. That\u2019s, like, his big thing that he wants, to help with crime. But how come he hasn\u2019t spoken out against the governor?\nBecause he loves what the mayor is doing to him? Because she\u2019s sitting there at the press conference and said she was going to deal with mental health in the subways and she didn\u2019t put the R.F.P. out for two weeks until Michelle Go is pushed in front of a subway station? Did a big press conference: We\u2019re going to do mental health in the subways. Didn\u2019t even put the R.F.P. out.On Jan. 6, more than a week before Michelle Go was pushed to her death in front of a moving train in the Times Square subway station, Ms. Hochul announced she would issue an immediate request for proposals to help support a subway safety plan. The request for proposals was released on Jan. 21, six days after the attack.\nSo I would help the mayor, as a person who understands what it\u2019s like to be the chief executive of a local government, and other mayors throughout the state and county executives and help them to run their municipalities instead of just holding things over their head. This is a game that is played by the State Legislature and by the governors to try and control the local officials to stop them from campaigning against them.\nAnd quite frankly, if the mayor couldn\u2019t get what he wants and I couldn\u2019t get what I want, which is pretty much the same as what he wants, I would try and persuade the mayor that he and I should team up together to clean out Albany. Because it\u2019s a broken system. There\u2019s no competition. The problem that exists in our country, in Congress, the problem that exists in the New York State Legislature, is everybody\u2019s seat is safe. And when a seat is safe, they don\u2019t listen to the people. The only way they can lose their seat is by losing a primary. And very few people, as we know, vote in the primaries. The far right votes in the Republican primaries, and the far left votes in the Democratic primaries. So the Democrats pander to the left, Republicans pander to the right, and nobody listens to what the people want in the middle.\nIf the people want you to do something about crime, how can it be that the government is not working on crime? How can it be the legislature is not \u2014 why isn\u2019t there a hearing every day on this? It\u2019s the No. 1 issue. How can that be? How can it be?\nWe have the highest taxes in the United States of America. We lost the SALT deduction.The SALT deduction, or the state and local tax deduction, allows taxpayers to deduct eligible state and local taxes on their federal returns. In 2017, Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which capped the deduction at $10,000 per year. People are leaving the state, despite what Mr. Appelbaum says. People are leaving the state in droves. Everybody knows somebody that moved to Florida, moved to North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Philly. How can it be that they\u2019re not talking about this stuff?\nBecause they\u2019re not afraid of the people. Democracy doesn\u2019t work. People are dying in Ukraine for freedom and democracy. What is democracy? It\u2019s politics. It\u2019s supposed to be that the people get what they want from the elected officials and if they don\u2019t get it, they kick them out. But they\u2019re not afraid of getting kicked out. They don\u2019t lose. Nobody loses.\nCongress has a 15 percent approval rating. Ninety percent get re-elected. And the state legislatures has a terrible reputation. They all get re-elected. How can that be?\nSo you need competition. You need people who are going to come in and say: We\u2019re going to do what the people want. So I\u2019m fighting for the people. I have a heart for the people, and I have the skills to get the job done. And I need The New York Times to help me win this race.\nNick Fox: You think you\u2019d have a better shot at Hochul if you were running in a general election? Obviously if \u2014\nI\u2019d have a great shot if she wasn\u2019t the sitting governor. Could you imagine if Kathy Hochul was the lieutenant governor who just was running for office? She didn\u2019t have access to this money that she\u2019s raised. It\u2019s an enormous amount of money. I mean, what is she running on?\nAll she\u2019s got is a huge bunch of money that was given, that \u2014 in campaign fundsAs of late May, Ms. Hochul has reportedly raised a $31.7 million, largely from real estate and other special interests, including building trades, hospitals and labor unions. that she got from \u2014 $250,000 from every lobbyist, every cannabis provider, every nursing home, every developer, which has a huge pile of money. Then she\u2019s got all this money that came from the federal government and all this money that came from Wall Street. She\u2019s giving it away. She\u2019s not dealing with [inaudible] we\u2019re going to see a downturn in the economy.\nAre we going to be prepared for a downturn in the economy? We already have the highest taxes in the United States of America. We have massive amounts of debt. We have spent Medicaid two and a half times the cost to the national average. We spend more per student than any state in the United States of America. Why aren\u2019t we using this money to, like, fix this stuff, to be ready for the long term?\nInstead, it\u2019s this one over here, that one over there. Buffalo Bills, Kensington Expressway. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2014 $350 million for Long Island legislators to get their votes, with no hearing? We don\u2019t even know what the $350 million is for yet. Just to get their votes, you get $350 million. Wasn\u2019t even part of her budget, wasn\u2019t part of the State Senate budget. It wasn\u2019t part of the Assembly budget. This is happening all over the place. That\u2019s just the ones what we know about.\nMara Gay: We\u2019ve got a lightning round for you.\nWhere is the lightning round? I still got all my stuff I wanted to share with you guys.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We still have 25 minutes.\nMara Gay: It\u2019s just to break things up. It\u2019s actually supposed to be fun.\nOh, ooh.\nMara Gay: What\u2019s the cost of a single subway or bus ride?\n$2.25?\nMara Gay: $2.75. Under what circumstances are abortions allowed in New York past 24 weeks?\nThe life of the mother. Health of the mother.\nMara Gay: And also if the fetus is not viable, yes. What is the average cost of SUNY tuition, including room and board, for one year?\nI don\u2019t know. $12,000?\nMara Gay: $23,350.\nOh, golly.\nMara Gay: Where did you go on your last vacation?\nHmm. I don\u2019t know. Florida? Florida?\nMara Gay: What\u2019s the median sale price of a home in Rochester? A guesstimate is fine.\n$140,000?\nMara Gay: 180,000. In White Plains?\n450,000? 500,000?\nMara Gay: 730,000. In Staten Island?\n800,000?\nMara Gay: 640,000. What about the median rent in Brooklyn?\n2,500? 3,000? 2,500! 2,500.\nMara Gay: It\u2019s 2,998. And what was your favorite class in high school?\nMath, probably. It\u2019s very straightforward.\nMara Gay: Great. Thank you.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You\u2019ve touched on, several times today, questions about the economy. As you mentioned, we are perhaps headed toward a downturn. What do you think the single most important thing to be doing right now, in terms of economic growth, is for the State of New York?\nLowering taxes. And I\u2019m a Democrat. But that\u2019s \u2014 we can\u2019t survive. People are leaving. They\u2019re just leaving.\nI know that you\u2019ve got \u2014 Mr. Appelbaum says the data doesn\u2019t prove it, but I see it. I hear it every single day. You hear it every single day. People are leaving.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So not jobs? You\u2019re not hearing \u2014\nWe need that to create jobs. We need to \u2014 I believe that the biggest opportunity for New York State is north of Putnam and Rockland County. There is huge opportunity there.\nI just was up in Buffalo the other day with the Bangladeshi community. I had a meeting with, like, 300 Bangladeshis. They left Queens. They bought foreclosed homes in Buffalo, and they\u2019ve completely transformed neighborhoods.\nI believe that there are huge opportunities to take the power and energy of the diversity of New York City and provide opportunities for people to move to different parts of the state to try and create centers, you know, tech centers. See, but right now, if you go north of Putnam and Rockland County, if you don\u2019t have a college or a jail or a hospital or a major tourism destination, you\u2019re dead. You can\u2019t possibly make it. There\u2019s no shot that you can make it.\nWe pass all these rules in New York from New York, that emanate from New York City. And New York City can take it because it\u2019s the financial capital of the world. We have Wall Street. We have insurance. We\u2019ve got real estate. We have tourism. We have entertainment. We can take it.\nAnd the downstate suburbs, they\u2019re feeding off of the mother ship. And we can take it, you know, except the property tax, but we can take it, for the most part.\nYou go upstate, you have all this oppression coming down on small businesses and on families and people who can\u2019t afford to live here. They can\u2019t take it. They\u2019re crushed. It\u2019s the poorest place. Spitzer said this is Appalachia. And he\u2019s right.\nPatrick Healy: Which taxes would you cut, and what would you give Democrats in the legislature to get a deal?\nWe\u2019d have to cut property taxes by increasing state aid. We\u2019ve been increasing state aid enormously. We should be tying increases in state aid to reduction in property taxes because the property taxes are regressive.\nThe first thing I would do, as far as property taxes, would be to give a break for senior citizens, people that are house rich and income poor. People on Long Island that moved there 50 years ago and bought their house for $50,000 and now they\u2019re worth $700,000.\nOr people that moved from Bedford-Stuyvesant. When I worked in Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1986 at the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Housing Project and the whole place was derelict and bombed out, people bought places for $10,000 or $20,000 or $30,000. Now they\u2019re worth a million or $2 million, but they can\u2019t afford to pay the property taxes because they\u2019re house rich but they\u2019re income poor.\nSenior citizens on a fixed income shouldn\u2019t have to pay above a certain percentage of their income in property taxes. It\u2019s the most regressive thing.\nPatrick Healy: You ran on property taxes before, though. It didn\u2019t work. Why is it that New Yorkers \u2014\nBecause I was running against Eliot Spitzer. I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing. And he was the sheriff of Wall Street.\nPatrick Healy: Right.\nAnd he had an enormous amounts of money, and \u2014\nPatrick Healy: Why doesn\u2019t it resonate, though? Like, in terms of going up against \u2014\nNo, no. It did resonate. It resonated with Eliot Spitzer. He appointed me a year later as chairman of the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief, and David Paterson reappointed me as chairman of the New York State Commission on Property Tax Relief. And I wrote the report as to why property taxes are so high in New York State and what we needed to do, which was a property tax cap, which we got outside of New York City.\nWe need an increase in state aid, and we need to do a circuit breaker. Fifteen years ago I wrote that report, and it\u2019s still the same problem.\nPatrick Healy: Can I just ask one other question on the economy, just about inflation. A lot of voters, a lot of people who might be attracted to Tom Suozzi just see themselves getting whacked in so many different ways on inflation. I mean, what is an idea that you, as governor, could execute on? Is there anything that doesn\u2019t involve legislature?\nI proposed a gas tax suspension back in January. And the only reason I \u2014 and listen, let me say it very clearly, OK? In Congress I\u2019ve spoken out very strongly. I\u2019m in favor of increasing taxes at the federal level. That\u2019s increasing taxes at the federal level so that wherever you go in the country, you\u2019ve got to pay more in taxes.\nAnd I\u2019d love to go back to revenue sharing, whereby you increase the taxes at the federal level and we get back the money that we sent you from, from New York so we can use the money to fix our own problems here in New York State. But I\u2019m against increasing taxes at the state level because we\u2019re pushing people out of New York State.\nWhen I was 1,In the early 1960s, when Mr. Suozzi was 1, 43 House members represented New York State. The state\u2019s population has increased since then, but other states have grown far more rapidly, which accounts for the reallocation of congressional seats. there were 45 members of Congress from New York State, based on our relative population. Today there\u2019s 27 members of Congress. It\u2019s going down to 26, and it\u2019s going to keep on going down.\nSo I would only propose a gas tax holiday in the context of, No. 1, we\u2019ve got all this money coming in for infrastructure. I said publicly, in Congress, many times, on Ways and Means, \u201cI will vote for a gas tax increase in Washington for infrastructure.\u201d I\u2019ve said that publicly. Everybody [inaudible] talks about infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. We\u2019re going to pay for it. I said, \u201cI will vote for a [inaudible] tax increase.\u201d Who else will do it? I knew we would do it, obviously. So I\u2019m all in favor of increasing gas taxes at the federal level, increasing income taxes at the federal level.\nBut New York State is dying. We cannot go this \u2014 it\u2019s climate change, OK?\nI was a New York State environmentalist of the year for the League of Conservation Voters. Al Gore gave me awards for cleaning up polluted sites when I was mayor of little Glen Cove, for cleaning up Superfund sites and hazardous waste sites. I did all kinds of programs. I\u2019m on the Green New Deal, OK? Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I are like this in a lot of things, but I\u2019m with her on the Green New Deal.\nI\u2019m all for the federal government investing massive amounts of money in addressing climate change. But we can\u2019t just do it in New York State by ourselves, because we do it by ourselves in New York State, our utility rates are going to continue to go up, and the people who can least afford to pay utility rates are the ones who hurt the most. They can\u2019t afford to pay increased utility rates.\nI do these telephone town halls, about 120,000 people, registered Democrats on telephone town halls. Every call is the same \u2014 crime, taxes and affordability, which is often utility rates. People can\u2019t take it.\nSo we can\u2019t do this stuff in New York where we push the businesses out of New York. They leave the Southern Tier, and they go to Pennsylvania. They\u2019re continuing to do the same exact pollution they were doing when they were in New York. It\u2019s still contributing to global warming. It\u2019s still bad. But we lost the tax base in the jobs in the process.\nNick Fox: What services would you cut to compensate for the tax cuts?\nNo, they would not pay for themselves. Medicaid is the main thing you have to do. Two and a half times the cost of the national average. We spend more than Texas and Florida combined on Medicaid, even though Texas and Florida are both bigger than New York State. I\u2019ve been talking to a lot of people about this. This is a little bit longer, but I fought for the Medicaid cap. New York State\u2019s the only state in the country that used to be 50 percent was paid by the feds, 25 percent by the state, 25 percent by the local governments.\nI was out in Nassau County \u2014 it was the worst-run county in America \u2014 transforming it, technology, fighting with the unions, doing all this stuff to try and change things. And the cops support me now, just so you know, even though I used to fight with them about their pay out of Long Island. \u201cIt\u2019s way too high,\u201d I said. I\u2019m doing all these things to try to reform.\nI raised taxes 19 percent my first year as a county executive. I\u2019m doing all this stuff to reform Nassau County, but my Medicare costs were going up 13 percent a year. I had no say over it whatsoever. So I did this thing, Fix Albany, where I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to defeat a Democratic Assembly, Republican State Senate, [inaudible] Democrats until you get us a Medicaid cap.\u201d\nI won the elections. I became the president of the County Executive Association, and I got a Medicaid cap of 3.5 percent a year. It then went down to 3 percent a year. When Cuomo came in, he reduced it as a big favor to the cities and the counties, the City of New York and the counties. He reduced it to zero. But now there\u2019s no accountability whatsoever by the cities and counties.\nNew York City spends 90 percent of the money in the entire country on home health care aids, on long-term care.In 2020, Medicaid spending, which funds home care and long-term care programs, was roughly $5 billion in New York City, about 5 percent of the city\u2019s budget. There\u2019s so much fraud going on where people literally say: I\u2019m going to send my parents to go to this adult day care facility. Nobody really goes to these adult day care facilities. Some people sign the paperwork saying that they\u2019re there, then the provider gives them a kickback, but nobody actually goes.\nIt\u2019s a cottage industry of fraud that\u2019s taking place every day. And there\u2019s historical fraud. It\u2019s always been going on in the nursing homes. And so I have a bill in Congress to actually deal with long-term care, called the Wish Act, which is to take care of catastrophic care. So long-term health care insurance could actually be affordable for people again.\nMara Gay: Can we talk about your path to victory?\nYes. New York Times has to endorse me.\nMara Gay: What are you doing to build your winning coalition, and where are those voters, and who are they?\nLong Island is very important to me. Westchester is very important to me.\nLatinos are very important to me. Diana Reyna is my running mate. Twelve years as a city councilwoman in Brooklyn, four years as deputy borough president to Eric Adams, first Dominican woman elected in the history of New York State. When she\u2019s elected lieutenant governor, she\u2019d be the first Latina elected statewide in the history of New York. Freddy Ferrer, Fernando Ferrer is the chairman of our campaign. Latino voters are very concerned about crime. I\u2019m working very hard to cultivate Latinos.\nMuslims are very important. They\u2019re a huge growing population. They never vote. I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time going to iftars and different events and just giving attention to the community. There\u2019s some African Americans, mainly Caribbeans, that I think I have a very good shot with.\nSo I got to do very well in Long Island, in Westchester. I\u2019ve got to do better in Queens than the other boroughs. I\u2019ve got to do better in Staten Island, but I haven\u2019t really put much attention into it yet. And I got to well in the Bronx. I think that there are anti-crime voters all over the state that are looking for someone to actually just hear what they\u2019re saying and do something about it. And so I\u2019ve raised $8 million so far. I\u2019ve got to raise about another $2 million. And if I raise $2 million and I get The New York Times endorsement, I can win the race.\nKathleen Kingsbury: You\u2019ve been pretty critical of Governor Hochul in this meeting. What\u2019s one thing you think she\u2019s done well so far as governor? Is there anything?\nShe\u2019s a very hard worker. She works very hard. I think that she lacks the executive experience to do this job. And I think she lacks the political experience to do the job. She\u2019s good at politics, as far as, you know, making speeches and going to visit people. And as far as, you know, she\u2019s getting a lot of groups to support her.\nBut as far as negotiating with the legislature, she got the Buffalo Bills. She did the whole process to get the Buffalo Bills. A billion dollars to keep the Buffalo Bills that nobody wanted. And she gave up everything for that. She\u2019s giving the money to the Buffalo Bills so that they don\u2019t leave. What does she do to stop the people from leaving New York State?\nEleanor Randolph: Wait \u2014\nI talk about the four Bs with the governor. I\u2019m going to continue to be critical, I\u2019m sorry, but: the Buffalo Bills, Brian Benjamin \u2014 her first decision that she made, blindly went into it.\nThere was all kinds of report about his ethical scandals that were going on. It came up again in November that he didn\u2019t fill out his, his questionnaires properly about being subpoenaed, and she still continued to double down and then tripled down on him, even after he\u2019d been called in by the F.B.I. a week before. It\u2019s just gross mismanagement and, and bad judgment.\nSo Brian Benjamin, the Buffalo Bills, the budget \u2014 secretive, most secretive process ever, not addressing the long-term fiscal problems \u2014 and bail reform. But really, crime overall. Just not making it a priority.\nEleanor Randolph: I mean, to bounce off that \u2014\nOh, just another thing. Can I say one more thing?\nEleanor Randolph: Of course.\nSo she has a 37 percent job approval rating. If you don\u2019t want Lee Zeldin to become the governor of New York State, you should endorse Tom Suozzi for governor, because she could lose the race. I won\u2019t lose to him. He can\u2019t beat me on Long Island. He can\u2019t beat me on crime and taxes.\nBut if you\u2019re worried about the progressive agenda that we care about, if you\u2019re worried about choice, if you\u2019re worried about any of the things that we \u2014 that The Times cares about, she could lose the race.\nEleanor Randolph: So you haven\u2019t said anything about Jumaane Williams. How would you feel if you split the vote with Hochul, and he actually got the primary?\nI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. He doesn\u2019t \u2014 first off, he\u2019s got a lot of volunteers and a lot of grass-roots support. And I have tremendous respect and admiration for him as a person. He does not have any money. And I don\u2019t think that, unlike the previous race, we had Cynthia Nixon at the top of the ticket, which we had money and celebrity to, to run the race. I don\u2019t think he has any chance of getting over 15 or 20 percent. So as a matter of fact, in my polling, his numbers actually went down from 14 percent down to 12 percent.\nKathleen Kingsbury: So assuming you win the primary, we\u2019ve seen in several recent gubernatorial elections across the country that issues, curriculum issues like C.R.T. and book banning, etc., have become major issues. Are you concerned about those issues here in New York? But also, just more generally, if you look across the state, what would you change in terms of education? I know you\u2019ve talked about bringing health and human services into schools, but is there anything else that you would want to do right away?\nI\u2019d like to move away from mandates to guidelines. And for school districts that \u2014 because I think the school districts spent an awful lot of time trying to comply with the rules. And the state spends a lot of time checking the boxes and filling out forms on a lot of the different rules. And if a school is performing well, based upon graduation rates, test scores, whatever we decide we want it to be, we should be giving teachers and administrators more freedom to run their schools.\nAnd for those schools that are troubled schools, where the kids are failing and they don\u2019t have a shot, you know, I\u2019m very sensitive to this because in Nassau County, we have the best schools in the United States of America in different places. We\u2019re also home to Hempstead and Roosevelt, which have left these kids behind for generations.\nSo we should be focusing our resources from the state level to help troubled school districts and leave the other school districts alone and let them just, you know, use guidelines. And if they\u2019re performing well, leave them alone.\nPatrick Healy: But is there a mandate you specifically dislike?\nYeah, but I\u2019m not going to get into that.\nPatrick Healy: Come on.\nEleanor Randolph: And curriculum?\nAlex Kingsbury: Competitions encourage leadership, right?\nYeah, we\u2019re not stupid, though. I\u2019ll lead when I\u2019m the governor.\nEleanor Randolph: So are there \u2014\nWe have more mandates in New York State than any other state in the United States of America.\nPatrick Healy: Yeah, you can pick one.\nEleanor Randolph: Curriculum mandates or no?\nNo. Really, special education mandates are really very, very onerous and ineffective. And these kids are getting left behind because of all these rules that are put in place that stop people with good hearts who are trying to do their job to help these kids, and they\u2019re, they\u2019re, this is \u2014\nMara Gay: What do you think of the rules that govern religious schools? And do you think that they should be strengthened, as some advocates in ultra-Orthodox communities say their children aren\u2019t being educated? Or do you that think we should just let those kids get the education that those schools \u2014\nYou know, in the case of the yeshiva schools, for example, or even Catholic schools, you know, 99 percent of them are very good.\nMara Gay: And those who aren\u2019t?\nAnd those who aren\u2019t, you should be calling them out and trying to send a task force in there to try and persuade them to change.\nMara Gay: That has not worked. What would you do to fix it?\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that it hasn\u2019t worked. I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s effectively tried to do that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Jyoti?\nJyoti Thottam: I just wanted to follow up. Since you raised this idea a few times that people are fleeing New York \u2014\nYeah. Yeah.\nJyoti Thottam: \u2014 because the taxes are too high. Do you have any data of your own to support that?\nJust things that I read here and there. Eighty thousand people applied for a Florida driver\u2019s license from New York State last year.More than 60,000 New Yorkers applied for a Florida driver\u2019s license in 2021, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. We have 315,000 \u2014 we have the largest net out-migration of any state in the United States of America in 2021From mid-2020 to mid-2021, New York experienced a larger net domestic migration outflow than any other state relative to its size. According to the Empire Center, the state lost more than 300,000 residents, many of whom left New York City. This is part of a broader trend of people moving out of large metro areas and is largely consistent with prepandemic trends. \u2014 314,000 person net out-migration, more than New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois and four smaller states combined.\nWe\u2019ve gone from, as I said, it\u2019s been going on for a long time, which Mr. Appelbaum likes to talk about all the time, but we went from 45 members of Congress down to 27 members of Congress. And it\u2019s going down to 26 next year. So as far as what the cause is, I believe that SALT was a big factor. But I\u2019ve abandoned that quest. And we have to reduce the taxes in New York State. And we have to improve the quality of life by addressing crime.\nKathleen Kingsbury: Greg?\nGreg Bensinger: Hi. In another lifetime, I was a member of the campaign finance board. I\u2019m curious what you think about these reports about your running mate and her obligations, her past obligations to the C.F.B.Diana Reyna reportedly owes the New York City Campaign Finance Board more than $138,000, stemming from a City Council campaign in 2009, when she spent less on qualified expenditures than she received through the city\u2019s matching funds.\nShe\u2019s got to pay the money back. She\u2019s got to pay it back.\nGreg Bensinger: Why is that not a concern when you picked her as a running mate?\nBecause of the fact that it\u2019s not like she did something wrong. She was in a race against the machine, against Vito Lopez. And her treasurer quit in the middle of the campaign, and she\u2019s always said that she will pay. If she\u2019s elected, she\u2019ll pay the money back. She doesn\u2019t have the money otherwise, Greg.\nI\u2019ve proposed a couple of different things regarding campaign finance. I have a six-point government accountability plan, of which one is that the state limit should be reduced from what is now $67,000 for the statewide candidates. We should just adopt the federal rules of $2,900.\nI\u2019ve also suggested that we should have quarterly reporting requirements, because right now the last report was in January and the next one\u2019s not due until the end of this month. I also believe in public finance. But I\u2019m not campaigning on that.\nIn law school, I received the New York State Bar Association\u2019s ethics award for the work that I did on the New York State Commission on Government Integrity, I think it was called, with the dean of my law school, Dean Ferrick, wrote that report, and I did the pro bono work working on that.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time, but we haven\u2019t actually talked about Covid yet. We\u2019re still in the middle of what is right now an upswing in cases. What needs to be done in terms of looking ahead? What do you think the state needs to be doing in terms of trying to bring Covid under control \u2014\nThe state needs to do it.\nKathleen Kingsbury: And help the public live with Covid from here on out.\nSorry, not that I want to be Johnny One Note, but I was very critical of the governor when we dealt with Covid before. Right after I announced, literally two days after I announced, my campaign staff was very mad at me.\nI noticed that the cases had come from 3,400 to 6,800 cases. Now, what was it? I don\u2019t know if they were reported cases. They seem like such small numbers now, but I can\u2019t remember. The cases had doubled from the beginning of October, I mean from the beginning of November to the end of November. And it was right after Thanksgiving. I was like, wow, we\u2019re about to go through a holiday surge. It\u2019s got to be \u2014 you know, Omicron had just been reported, the first, No. 1 case.\nI said we need a multifaceted, comprehensive plan to promote boosters, to promote vaccines, to encourage mask wearing, to have more testing sites. To do this thing, where you say this is a hot spot, you know, because with the Times report, which is very valuable that you guys do. But you know, at the time, it was like 15 percent infection rate in Buffalo, but it was only 2 percent rate, or 1\u00bd percent rate in New York City. And we need to be flooding resources as far as marketing, especially, but also other resources for testing into places where the problems are particularly bad.\nSo I believe very strongly that mandates are such a toxic thing in our culture right now because of Trump and because of everything that the Republicans have done with this and some of the mismarketing by the Democrats that we really need to go out and sell this to people. We need to build.\nI\u2019m a very big believer in taking very disparate viewpoints and then trying to find a comprehensive solution that finds middle ground and then going out and selling it to the people. We should be having hospitals and doctors, which have these massive email lists \u2014 they should be sending it out to their patients, asking people to get their booster shots and educating people as to what to do. We should be having celebrities. It can\u2019t [inaudible] Dr. Fauci and the C.D.C., and then you had, you know, Trump and the anti-vaxxers.\nWe need to have some trusted people that people are familiar with out selling the idea of vaccines and masks and the other stuff that people need to be doing. So it\u2019s really a big marketing effort. It\u2019s a leadership effort. It\u2019s an idea of selling to the people what they need to be doing, because if we just try and mandate it, we\u2019re going to have a further fracturing of our society.\nKathleen Kingsbury: We\u2019re just about out of time. I wanted to end on asking you, what do you see as just your greatest accomplishment as a member of Congress? Just one.\nI would say probably \u2014 I\u2019m going to get in trouble now \u2019cause I haven\u2019t thought about this. I would probably say the $1.2 trillion for the infrastructure deal. I helped to change the rules in Congress on getting bills on the floor. We had a big fight with Nancy Pelosi when she first got elected and won, and it actually made things much more open. I mean, I didn\u2019t change the culture very much.\nI dramatically increased the funding for the Long Island Sound by 5 \u2014 900 percent to clean up the Long Island Sound. Got the money in to clean up the Bethpage bloom. It\u2019s been there for 40 years. It was one of these comprehensive things, when I brought in the E.P.A., the D.E.C. They let local elected officials, the Army Corps, the commissioner \u2014 I got a whole list of things I\u2019ve done, quite frankly.\nEleanor Randolph: Just one.\nI can\u2019t think of just one.\nNick Fox: Can I just ask one more, please?\nOh, the Congressional Gold Medal for the Harlem HellfightersIn 2021, Mr. Suozzi introduced legislation that awarded the Harlem Hellfighters, an African American infantry regiment in World War I, a Congressional Gold Medal. was a big deal.\nNick Fox: Can you mention any notable endorsements you\u2019ve had?\nThe I.B.E.W. And my wife.\nKathleen Kingsbury: That seems like a good note to end on.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In a landmark ruling by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that it is time \u201cto return the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d In effect that means that millions of people \u2013 mostly in conservative states \u2013 will imminently lose access to abortion in America. The three liberal justices who dissented wrote \u201cwith sorrow\u201d that \u201cone result of today\u2019s decision is certain: the curtailment of women\u2019s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.\u201d\n\u2018We're Hurtling Into A Reactionary Future\u2019\nTimes Opinion columnist Michelle Goldberg, Times Opinion editor Lauren Kelley and the writer Leah Libresco Sargeant discuss what comes next with Times Opinion podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro.\nMichelle, I want to begin with you. What was your initial reaction when you heard the news?\nObviously I knew this was coming. I never had any hope that the leaked draft wasn't essentially what the Court was going to do, but I still really feel like I've been punched in the stomach.\nEven when I tried to remind myself that liberties are always frail and progress isn't eternal, it just feels like we have been cast back into a radically different nation than the one I expected to raise my children in.\nLauren, you cover reproductive rights. Tell us what this decision means in plain English. It was a long decision, several dozen pages, but what does it actually mean?\nIt means that Roe v. Wade is fully overturned, which is both something that is so straightforward and simple in some way, but is also just absolutely remarkable.\nIt was really very, very recent that we were told by many of the pundits in this country and experts who follow the Supreme Court that Roe v. Wade would not be fully overturned. And it certainly wouldn't be overturned fully in an election year. I think as recently as just before the oral arguments for this Dobbs decision \u2013 December 1st I believe \u2013 the thinking was really: Well, there might be some sort of compromise. They might roll it back. But this full overturning just was not on the table in a lot of people's eyes.\nAnd to just see that window shift so quickly in this last nine months or so. It's just actually kind of dizzying.\nLeah, you're opposed to abortion. And I'd like to get your reaction to today's ruling. What did you feel when it came down, even though you knew it was coming?\nIt's kind of dizzying. The first protest march I ever went to was in utero with my mom, who took me to a pro-choice march. So for me, this is an issue I've changed my mind about as I've grown up and as I've learned more about babies in the womb, and as I've thought more expansively about what support women need and deserve.\nSo, it's good to see an opinion that undoes the injustice of Roe, but obviously we don't have a culture that fully supports women. I'd like this to be a day that everyone feels relief in the same way I hope we would if a different Supreme Court precedent, Buck v. Bell, had been stricken down, which legitimized incredible prejudice and involuntary sterilization of the disabled.\nBut I know this isn't a happy day for a lot of Americans and I just, I wish we had a culture that supported women more and gave people more reason to hope that we can take care of everyone who's vulnerable.\nLeah, I just want to stay with you for a moment. And if you can explain to me, when you say that you changed your mind on this, what did that look like? Why have you landed where you have landed in your opinion?\nSo the thing I've agreed with the whole time is Ruth Bader Ginsburg wanted abortion upheld, not as a right to privacy, but as a right to equal protection under the law.\nAnd she made the case that abortion is really the price of admission to society we demand of women. And I think she's factually right. That's what we ask of women. We don't support women when they're pregnant, even with wanted pregnancies. We don't support parents nationwide. We place heavy burdens on parents who are most vulnerable. TANF, which is support for needy families, has been hollowed out. The child allowance didn't make it to parents who were the poorest.\nSo it's true, you can look around and say, our culture has no room for the vulnerable. It doesn't have room for babies who are vulnerable and it doesn't have room for women who are vulnerable. So abortion is a crutch that lets us navigate that hatred of dependence that's pervasive in our culture. I think it's one more mark of a sexist society that we take the burdens we put on the vulnerable, then lay them heavily on women and demand an act of violence to have equal access to society.\nMichelle, I just want to get your understanding of why you support a woman's right to choose.\nSure. I've often said that the question for me in abortion is not whether a fetus is a person, it's whether a woman is a person and a woman\u2019s desire for equality. The fact that the state does not support dependency is one reason that women get abortions, but it is by no means the only reason.\nI'm sure I would agree with Leah that no woman should have to get an abortion because she can't afford a wanted pregnancy. Although obviously today's decision does nothing to support the women who will now be forced to go forward with pregnancies that they either can't afford or desperately don't want.\nBut there is just something so deeply invasive, degrading and dehumanizing about being forced to be pregnant against your will, about being forced to give birth, which is an experience of pain unlike any that most people will ever experience in their lives \u2013 it's a degree of pain that would be considered torture in any other circumstance \u2013 that the state can force you to do that, that it can force you to give up your body in a way that it would never force you to give up your house, in a way that it would never force you to give up an organ.\nYou know, the state can't compel you to donate a kidney to save someone's life. It can't compel you to donate your blood, but it can compel you \u2013 it can take from you your bodily autonomy. It is just an invasion and there is no way around it. I support all of the same policies that I'm sure Leah does, but none of those will ever change the fact that forced pregnancy and forced birth puts women in a position of second-class citizenship.\nAnd then there's a second-order concern, which is just that the regime necessary to sustain an abortion ban is invasive at best, and totalitarian at worst, because it's just going to require a massive amount of surveillance of women and their choices.\nIn countries that ban abortion \u2013 and I've been to many of them \u2013 you constantly see miscarriages investigated and in some cases, criminalized, because the line between a miscarriage and an abortion is not clear. And so this is dangerous, not just for women who are going to affirmatively try to end unwanted pregnancies. It is dangerous for any woman who might get pregnant, period. I'm past that, but I mourn the world that I'm leaving for my daughter.\nI'm gonna jump in and say this. I had an abortion. It was incredibly traumatic. It has left me with a very nuanced view of this issue, which I never felt the political rhetoric ever fully addressed: that I can at the same time support a woman's right to choose, and yet have very conflicted feelings about when and where that should happen.\nAnd I know Lauren, you've been reporting on abortion for a long time and editing many writers on this topic and doing a huge amount of research and talking to women who've had abortions. And one of your takeaways has been that opinions on abortion in this country are very nuanced.\nSure, over the course of doing this job over the years, I've spoken to many, many women who've had abortions. I've talked to many abortion providers, and it is really quite striking actually how, when you talk to people about their experiences, like your experience, Lulu, that you just shared with us, and even abortion providers in many cases, the things that they have to say about abortion often are really quite divorced from the sort of political, national debate about this issue.\nThere is a lot of nuance in people's personal feelings about this issue, and again, even in abortion providers\u2019 feelings about doing this work. But I would just say that something very, very simple sort of gets lost here. And that's that abortion is just a reality. You hear people sort of throw around the statistic that one in four women in their lifetime in America will have an abortion, and that is true. It's almost become sort of a slogan in a way, or a bumper sticker.\nBut it also is just this basic starting point that I think we don't start from often enough: that abortion is inevitable. You cannot stop people from getting abortions. We have seen it year after year after year for decades, for centuries, really. And we're just looking at this future where so many more women are going to end up in desperate situations and desperate to not be pregnant, and their choices are going to be few and far between. And whether you want abortion to exist or not, it exists, and it is going to keep existing. And I think that's just the place we have to start from now going forward into this great abyss that we're in.\nLeah, we know that laws like this impact Black and Brown women, poor women, the most. They're the ones who will bear the brunt of this decision. The United States is now one of only a handful of countries to actively roll back existing abortion protections. As someone who wanted to see the end of Roe, what's your response to the concern that women who won't be able to get an abortion are poor women?\nI appreciate your question, especially about America's exceptional status in the world, because America was exceptional before today. America had some of the most expansive laws in terms of access to abortion in the world. It's much more common across Europe to have nearer total bans, except for life of the mother, after 12 weeks than it is in America. And even then, that affects a small minority of abortions. The vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester.\nAmericans when polled both favor upholding Roe, but also favor restrictions that are incompatible with Roe, which include heavy restrictions from the second trimester onward. So people have really mixed feelings, and America has had for years a much more expansive sense of when and if it would be permissible to end a life than the rest of the world.\nI don't want to discount the racial or poverty impact at all, because every single law we pass has a disparate impact on people who are not white, people who are poor, people who are vulnerable by any kind of identity marker. I'd contrast this with the laws we have around child protection services, which I think we'd all agree on this call are an important part of what the state does. The state exists to protect people who are vulnerable, who need the intervention from someone who can speak for them when they're placed in danger or abused and don't have the ability to escape or seek redress.\nBut it's absolutely the case that the American child protective service system and the foster care system is discriminatory towards poor parents, towards Black parents. It'll take children from a house where the parents can't take care of them because they're poor and then subsidize foster parents to take care of the children when the original parents needed the money. I see the solution to this as fighting against racism in our society and in our law, but not at dismantling laws or giving up on protecting the vulnerable. I don't think we can do without child protective services, but I think we need a massive overhaul in how it works.\nMichelle, I'd like you to respond to that. When you hear Leah talk about this, what are you hearing?\nSo look, I've had two kids and one second-trimester miscarriage. So I feel like after you have children, or at least for me, having children gave me an appreciation of the value of the fetus that I didn't have as a younger pro-choice activist. I know very well we're not just talking about a clump of cells. I know very well that we're talking about something that is a life, even if you don't believe it is a full person. And I understand that it's often something that is morally, quite fraught and complicated and anguishing, even if for other women it's quite straightforward.\nBut what I don't hear from Leah or other people is what you say to a person who is in front of you screaming, I don't want this to happen to me. And your answer is essentially: I feel bad for you. I want to help you. But at the end of the day, too bad.\nI think the answer to suffering is accompaniment in it, provision of all material help that we can possibly give. I think in America that often involves a mix of both private charity and public law changes and help in just accessing the aids we've already ostensibly passed for vulnerable women, but then we don't make it available to them. We offload all the administrative work of our welfare state onto \u2013\nRight, but there is essentially \u2013 there's a harm of pregnancy. There's travail and pain and transformation involved that that cannot be, it can be kind of ameliorated. But essentially, if pregnancy itself is the thing that is much more dangerous than abortion, and again, you are saying that women should have to go through that against their will. And I think all these other supports are nice, and I think we can both agree that they're necessary, but none of them change that essential fact.\nListening to you both talk, what strikes me is that a lot of the discussion around Roe had been that Roe is inherently divisive. But what I'm hearing from both of you is these very deeply held beliefs. And so Lauren, I suspect this now will only get uglier. Instead of one fight at the federal level over abortion, there is now going to be 50 fights, in every state.\nLulu, you raise a good point that really wild and probably chaotic things are about to happen.\nAt least some of the justices on the court, like we heard from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, for instance, during the Dobbs arguments, suggest that it is time for the Court to wash its hands of this issue, return it to the states and sort of be neutral. And it suggests that we will be, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, ending an era. And in some ways we are.\nBut I think it shouldn't be lost that we are really entering a whole new chaotic era. Like you said, we have now 50 individual state options for fighting this battle. We know that about half of those states are going to ban all or most abortions very soon, if not already.\nWe know that a growing number of women are going to be pregnant and desperate. We know that they will turn to various means to end those pregnancies. It might be pills; it might be physical trauma, which is still alarmingly common. We know that some women will be prosecuted because that already happens. And we know that some women will die. Those things we know are going to happen. I just want to say that there\u2019s also a lot we don't know, and I think it's important to sort of be humble about that. We don't know how the public is going to react to this. I think we're really in uncharted waters in terms of an election year.\nAll of the various traumas that we have experienced as a society recently, I think people are quite exhausted. So I think it's anybody's guess sort of how the public, how voters, how activists and the movements react to this, not to mention individual politicians. Then I think also, I would expect that we see some states sort of really, really push the boundaries, especially when it comes to going after individual women, which has always been historically something that the pro-life movement liked to mostly stay away from.\nI suspect we see more of that. I suspect that we see some of them pull back a bit if voters don't find that palatable.\nMichelle, one thing that is clear is that those who supported abortion access lost the fight. This decision is the result of decades of work on the right to get justices seated who would deliver the end of Roe. Why do you think that failure happened?\nPartly it happened because of the anti-democratic nature of our institutions, or the counter-majoritarian nature of our institutions.\nAnd there's a subtlety here because on the one hand, Roe v. Wade was itself a decision that was meant to protect minority rights \u2013 the rights of women in states where there is popular support for banning abortions. At the same time, there is broad popular support for Roe as it stood and the only reason that it has now been overturned is because we had presidents who lost the popular vote and nonetheless were able to appoint Supreme Court justices.\nAnd so Democrats have won popular majorities in I believe seven out of the last eight elections and that hasn't been enough to give them control of the Supreme Court.\nAnd so we see the kind of counter-majoritarian vice tightening around American institutions where the majority will have less and less ability to exercise its prerogatives.\nAt the same time, there's a lot that the pro-choice movement can learn from the grassroots organizing of the anti-abortion movement: its relentless focus on local politics; its march through the institutions; its ability to capture state legislatures. I think that the pro-choice movement, and maybe liberals more generally, were too reliant on what was a kind of exceptional situation. We had this brief period where you had the Supreme Court as a kind of protector of last resort of liberalism and civil rights, and haven't done the grassroots work that is needed to create an institutional base for, for these rights. And it's a really long road back. I wish I felt more hope that we will make it there.\nLeah, acknowledging the failure on the opposite side of this, where do you see the push going next in terms of your side of the debate. What would you like to see happen?\nWell, it's obviously, it's a 50 state fight, and I think it's really incumbent on us to make the case not just that abortion should be illegal, but it should be unthinkable. Both because of the monstrous injustice of taking the most vulnerable members of our society, saying we have no room for them and no room for the people whom they depend on, is something that we can't sustain.\nI want it to be like other campaigns for justice, where we win more and more hearts to the idea that this is a barbarity we can and must leave behind.\nAnd I think that comes paired with material support for people who are vulnerable and just a real acknowledgement that dependency is the human condition. No one stands alone. No one is free of obligations to others. What we deserve, what our duties create, is a right to be supported in our duties.\nAnd we've fallen short of that for much longer than Roe\u2019s been in effect, and that fight's going to keep going on across the country.\nI\u2019d like to end with what this moment has left you feeling from your own personal perspectives.\nI remember when I was pregnant a few years ago and I showed all my coworkers the picture on The Bump app of my baby at eight weeks. And everyone was surprised by what a baby looked like then. And it wasn't as pro-life outreach \u2013 it was because I was so excited about the baby, and everyone responded to my baby as a baby.\nAnd two weeks after that, I found out that our baby Ariel had died. And there was such a gap between how my coworkers responded in seeing my child and how my doctor responded the second they knew my baby was dead, in terms of just talking about the pregnancy.\nAnd I want a world where we can love babies and women and fathers more. And I think people have a natural heart for that, and they need more permission for hope.\nI am still processing this moment, I think, it has been looming for so long. But I will say that there is a real physicality to it, that's quite striking. I noticed it when the draft opinion leaked in May and I heard lots of friends and other people I know who follow these things respond similarly \u2013 that there is just a visceral, physical feeling that I won't pretend to be able to unpack exactly what it means in this moment, but it's profound. I am feeling it in my bones.\nI agree with Lauren and that's what I'm hearing from many of my friends.\nHonestly, I just feel \u2013 and hopefully this feeling won\u2019t last \u2013 but I feel a real sense of hopelessness not just about the declining prospects for women's equality, but just where this country is going. We're hurtling into a reactionary future in which none of the guarantees of liberty can be taken for granted. It is so frightening to me. And again, I feel such a sense of shame over the country that my children are going to inherit. It is really difficult for me to put it into words.\nMichelle, are you going to talk to them about this decision?\nI'm not sure. My kids are seven and nine and I have tried to shield them a little bit from the general bleakness.\nSometimes my son will ask me, what do you think the world is gonna be like when I grow up? And I try to redirect the conversation because it's difficult for me to answer.\nI usually say things like, what do you want it to be like? What should we work towards?", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Sign up for The Next Pandemic newsletter.\nSign up for The Next Pandemic newsletter.\nIt\u2019s been three years since the Covid-19 pandemic began, and yet many aspects of how to best respond to a novel virus remain unsettled or fiercely debated.\nThe next currently unknown virus that could cause a pandemic \u2014 what the World Health Organization calls \u201cDisease X\u201d \u2014 may be different from Covid, requiring a different set of tools and a different level of response. As Dr. Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, outlines in a guest essay, public health leaders sometimes participate in simulations where they are asked to make decisions based on limited information about Disease X, as they would at the beginning of any pandemic.\nWe asked a group of experts to take part in a scaled-down Disease X simulation to show readers the diversity in views on how to best respond to pandemic threats \u2014 quickly, with little detail, as they would likely have to in a real-world situation. We gave the experts a few parameters, and asked them to briefly address specific questions they may be asked by local leaders if such a virus were to emerge and spread in their communities.\nAs you\u2019ll see, not everyone agrees. We hope to show that experts with policy-making experience and similar goals can come to different conclusions and advise different strategies.\nParameters: A respiratory virus starts spreading tomorrow in the United States. It appears more transmissible and more deadly than SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and it is equally risky for children and adults, based on the rapid spread and number of deaths in another country. There's no available vaccine, though one is under investigation. There are only 10 reported cases in the United States, but five are in the jurisdiction you are advising. This is all the information available.\nShould schools close?\nYes, but only briefly. Prolonged school closures during the Covid-19 pandemic caused substantial harms that will likely be felt for decades.\nDr. Jay Varma, former Covid-19 adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York\nWhy, then, would anyone argue in favor of closure? In this scenario, I believe jurisdictions should close in-person school and child care for a brief, well-defined period to strengthen respiratory virus protection measures and accommodate students who choose remote learning and employees who are most vulnerable.\nWith a new, potentially lethal respiratory virus circulating, school closures have two theoretical benefits: reduce illness in children and adults present in schools, and reduce community spread. The harms include impaired education and social and emotional development; physical and mental health issues; and loss of economic activity for parents.\nDuring a brief closure for this new pandemic, states should use the billions of unspent Covid-19 funds and recent Covid-19 systems and contracts to immediately improve indoor air ventilation and disinfection, enlist families to build do-it-yourself air purifiers, supply N95 or KN95 masks in all sizes, contract with local health organizations to provide on-site testing services, and develop alternative staffing and remote learning plans for personnel and children who decline to come to school.\nThis latter point is critical: Many staff members and parents fear for their and their children\u2019s safety during epidemics, and jurisdictions must accommodate their needs, which may require suspending in-person school. But policymakers should publicly commit to reopening no later than four weeks after closure. For those localities that choose not to close, federal officials should make high-quality masks available through a mail-order system and fund remote learning options that meet the home-schooling requirements in multiple states.\nNo, at least not yet. The decision to close schools must be based on the best current understanding of risks and benefits.\nDr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nPre-Covid modeling of school closures in an influenza pandemic indicated that benefits might only be minimal and the harms substantial.\nExperience during Covid makes the harms of school closures even more apparent. Children fell far behind in learning, creating a gap that will reverberate for years, as well as in their social and emotional development. Children lost opportunities for healthy nutrition, physical activity, social support and more. Parents and caregivers were less able to work efficiently. And these costs fell disproportionately on those least able to afford it \u2013 families living in or near poverty or who are otherwise disconnected or disenfranchised.\nFor all these costs, the benefits of closing schools may be minimal. Masking, ventilation, protocols to keep ill children home and other measures minimize spread in schools. Because children often congregate in less-controlled environments when not in school (social events, contact sports, other indoor environments), the reduction in virus transmission may be relatively small.\nIt might become necessary to temporarily close schools in the event of widespread closures, or if schools have difficulty operating safely due to illness among a large proportion of staff, or if a school is caring for medically frail children or, in a last resort, because the virus is spreading widely and with high severity in schools. But the bar to close schools needs to be high \u2013 much higher than was used during Covid. If schools are closed, there should be frequent reassessments with the goal of reopening as soon as possible.\nShould there be a mask mandate?\nYes, it will help. The virus is most likely already spreading undetected in our community.\nDr. Nicole Lurie, former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nWith the virus spreading rapidly in another country, and with five cases found in our area, we can be confident it\u2019s here. The spread will probably now be rapid and exponential, and soon it will be a major killer.\nOur first job is to save lives and slow the spread, and my advice to a city official is that a temporary mask mandate will help with that until we know more about this virus and a vaccine or other therapy becomes available. The sooner we act, the better are our chances to avert needless deaths, prevent the health care system from crashing and limit economic damage.\nThe simple truth is that high-quality masks are effective in slowing the spread of respiratory viruses. During the early days of the Covid pandemic, countries that quickly put mask mandates in place had far fewer cases and deaths than those that did not. Studies also show that communities with mask mandates saw fewer infections than those without them.\nWhy a mandate? Because getting a virus under control is much harder unless everyone wears one. Wearing a mask might feel a little uncomfortable, but it's far better than losing a loved one.\nA mandate is more likely to be accepted if city officials already have community trust. This requires listening, explaining and maintaining honest, clear communication with the public and community leaders, and aggressively combating disinformation. Public trust is key to reducing infection and death. Doing the right thing is not always easy, but it will save lives.\nNo, this isn\u2019t the time. There are other effective interventions to focus on first.\nDr. Anders Tegnell, the former state epidemiologist in Sweden\nThis is most likely not the time to mandate masks, as there are other options. People should avoid crowded indoor spaces and stay home if they are feeling sick. People should work from home as much as possible. Big events should be canceled, and the number of diners allowed in restaurants should be restricted. These are all interventions that are likely to lower the spread of disease.\nContact tracing needs to start now, and testing should be made available when it can be. In health care settings, masks should be used. Masks and other hygiene measures should be especially emphasized in elderly care.\nStudying this disease and learning more about it and what interventions might be most effective should begin right away. That way all measures can be tailored to the situation at hand.\nSweden did not issue a mask mandate during the Covid pandemic, though masks were encouraged at various points. The few high-quality studies done on mask wearing in public show, in my view and that of other researchers, a limited effect. It should not be considered the first or most important intervention to control spread. However, careful monitoring is essential to tailor interventions to the new threat.\nShould there be an international travel ban?\nYes, if done properly. Travel bans can be an effective public health tool.\nDr. Jerome Adams, the 20th U.S. surgeon general\nTravel restrictions have been used throughout history to slow infectious disease spread. They can\u2019t keep diseases out of a region indefinitely, but they can buy time while the authorities learn more about a disease and its spread, and deploy additional surveillance, containment and treatment measures.\nIf you know, for instance, that there are higher levels of a virus detected (via testing or appearance of symptoms) in one place versus another, having a travel restriction can decelerate the inevitable diffusion of disease. Such delays can save resources, and lives. We saw this in 2020 when early travel restrictions helped prevent health institutions in the United States from being overwhelmed to the extent of those in countries like Italy.\nHowever, it is a fallacy to believe travel restrictions alone will keep us safe in a world of global mobility and difficult-to-detect viruses, particularly ones that spread asymptomatically. Further, travel bans done haphazardly can unfairly discriminate and impose heavy economic costs.\nTo be most effective, travel restrictions should be appropriately timed and targeted, and must be coupled with additional measures. We met some of those criteria with Covid-19 but failed on too many others. Just as is the case with other pandemic response tools, our past suboptimal use doesn\u2019t mean the tool itself was ineffective, or that we shouldn\u2019t consider a pause on travel when future threats arise. Our goal should be to make better and smarter use of travel restrictions, not to do away with them altogether.\nNo, the impact will be low. Travel bans have rarely stopped the spread of new pathogens.\nDr. Jennifer B. Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health\nAt best, they may temporarily slow the arrival of pathogens, but their impact depends on what comes next.\nIn 2020, a handful of countries, like New Zealand, used strict travel restrictions to buy time to bolster their national testing and contract tracing capacities against Covid. But too often travel restrictions replace a full domestic response.\nTo stop or meaningfully slow the spread of a pathogen, travel bans must be imposed early, with good knowledge of where a pathogen is spreading. But national surveillance capabilities tend to show us cases only in the countries looking hardest for infection. When the United States restricted travel from China at the end of February 2020, the coronavirus had probably already been spreading stateside for weeks. New York\u2019s deadly first wave of cases was later linked to travel from Europe. Restrictions also didn\u2019t prevent a large Omicron wave in the United States.\nInstead, travel bans can create a chilling effect on other countries\u2019 willingness to diagnose and report cases. It also hampered the movement of critical supplies to the same laboratories upon which the world depended for important information about the virus.\nInstead of stopping travel, we should focus on making travel safer. Once we have a diagnostic test, we should set up temporary testing at airports. We should also expand our surveillance to include wastewater from planes to track pathogens and genetic variants.\nIf a safe and effective vaccine becomes available, should it be mandated?\nPossibly, even though they\u2019re unpopular. Mandates can be helpful in a pandemic.\nWendy Parmet, director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern\nLaws that require individuals to be vaccinated to work or go to school do limit individual autonomy and clash with some religious beliefs. They can also deepen distrust of public health. Still, for almost 200 years, mandates have proven to be an effective public health tool that should be considered during a pandemic.\nThe reasons for mandates are simple. People who forgo vaccination may be more likely to infect others, including those who cannot be vaccinated or for whom vaccines will not work due to immune impairments. During an outbreak, vaccine rejection can also strain the health care system.\nIn an ideal world, governments could counter the problem of low vaccination rates by increasing public awareness of the benefits and safety of vaccines and ensuring that vaccines are easily accessible. Unfortunately, such efforts often fall short, especially in the face of zealous vaccination opponents, rampant misinformation, and a highly polarized environment.\nWell-devised mandates can sometimes help overcome such resistance, nudging those who are not adamantly opposed to vaccines to get vaccinated. Indeed, numerous studies have shown that mandates for schoolchildren and health care workers improve their vaccination rates.\nIn all cases, health officials should weigh the benefits and risks of mandates, including the risk of a backlash. Officials must also ensure that the evidence strongly demonstrates the vaccine\u2019s safety and efficacy, that the reasons for a mandate are well explained, and that the mandate is enforced equitably. Everyone must also have the economic and social means for complying. Whether those criteria are met for any given vaccine mandate can be debated. What is certain is that a pandemic is not the time to take mandates off the table.\nNot without exemptions. Mandates work, but they come with side effects.\nDr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health\nThe effectiveness of vaccine mandates depends on how they are carried out and on exemptions allowed from these requirements.\nOver the last couple of decades, my colleagues and I have conducted studies to answer the question: What mandates are optimal to achieve high vaccination rates while ensuring vaccine requirements garner broad support? Much of our data comes from school-based mandates, but our analysis is relevant to other types of vaccine mandates as well.\nOur findings suggest that vaccine mandates work, and that mandates that are too easy to opt out of are less effective. However, if there are no exemptions, or if it is too hard to get one, people find ways to avoid vaccine requirements. In the case of school-based mandates, many people may home-school their children or simply ignore vaccine mandates in schools that are lax about enforcing them.\nA middle-of-the-road approach to vaccine mandates is most effective and sustainable. First, medical as well as religious or philosophical exemptions should be allowed. Physician counseling can be required for those who file for exemptions \u2013 this approach was effective in Washington State for reducing childhood vaccine refusal. Experience from U.S. colleges during the Covid-19 pandemic suggests that more frequent testing for the unvaccinated is also associated with high vaccination rates without significant backlash from students (or their parents).", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

His aviator glasses, gleaming white teeth and peroxide hair gave him the appearance of a Las Vegas timeshare salesman; instead, he was flogging a story to other famous men like Rickie Lambert, the former Liverpool and England forward, who had advertised this rally in advance without mentioning its special guest.\nAdvertisement\nOn the opposite side of the road was another group, making a stand against fascism. For a good half-hour, two men holding megaphones used the busy thoroughfare as a barrier between ideologies as cars went past and bemused commuters tried to get home.\nWhile the anti-fascists screamed about Nazis and the real problems Liverpool\u2019s residents should campaign against, the \u201cfreedom\u201d movement stood behind yellow placards that advised readers to \u201cquestion everything\u201d and to \u201close the denial\u201d. There was also another warning: \u201c15-minute neighbourhoods will be your prison.\u201d\nThat, ultimately, was what Lambert was here for: to raise awareness of the supposed threat of Liverpool becoming a \u201c15-minute city\u201d, where the local government stands accused of planning to essentially segregate districts in the name of climate change.\nSky emerged as an online agitator at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic by railing against restrictions at a series of \u201cfreedom rallies\u201d. To his followers, he is a precious purveyor of truth in a world of sinister forces trying to exercise control; to many more, he is a dangerous conspiracy theorist.\nThere was, however, no denying he was the star attraction on Wednesday. After another \u201cfreedom\u201d spokesman with the megaphone denied the event\u2019s links to the far right \u2014 \u201cThis has nothing to do with racism,\u201d he claimed \u2014 Sky and his followers ambled towards the space in front of the crown court. Then, after the rally\u2019s organiser described those mainly middle-class-looking older women and students handing out socialist newsletters on the other side of the street as \u201csatanic\u201d communists trying to \u201csteal our souls\u201d, Sky was invited to talk.\n\u201cHello Liverpool,\u201d he shouted into the mic, only for his voice to disappear in a violent gust blowing in from the Irish Sea.\nSky announced that he was on a tour to change the world courtesy of speeches like this one, which included unsubstantiated claims about the return of Covid-19, the weaponising of climate change by governments in an attempt to control freedoms, and a hidden LGBT agenda that the audience needed to be aware of because according to the Bible, \u201cpride\u201d was one of the seven deadly sins.\nAdvertisement\nLambert, who did not speak despite his role in promoting the event, stood by, taking it all in. Most people did, but for one Liverpudlian in a vest, who piped up from the back of the crowd: \u201cWhy the f*** are we listening to some American talk about our city?\u201d\nIt was at that point that someone informed him that Sky, whose surname is really Saccoccia, was in fact from Canada.\nIn his book, Red Pill Blue Pill, David Newert describes a conspiracy theory as \u201ca hypothetical explanation of historical or ongoing new events comprised of secret plots, usually of a nefarious nature, whose existence may or may not be factual\u201d.\nIn recent years, Newert adds that it has also become a \u201ckind of dismissive epithet\u201d. The majority of people, he explains, do not have the time for conspiracist beliefs and, therefore, it is easier to banish those who do as \u201ccartoonish scam peddlers\u201d.\nA psychologist based in Merseyside, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of his working contracts, makes comparisons between conspiracy theorists and his experiences in the drug services when survivors discover salvation, prompting them to want to impart their knowledge to others by working in recovery.\n\u201cWhen conspiracy theorists discover something, they never keep it to themselves,\u201d he concludes. \u201cThey have to pass it on to someone else. Now they know their place in the world, they see themselves as crusaders.\u201d\nConspiracy theories can take root in every sector of society and yet there are compelling reasons why sportspeople \u2014 including footballers \u2014 could be particularly susceptible.\nLambert has used his social media platforms to perpetrate a variety of outlandish theories, including calling for doctors and nurses who vaccinated children against Covid-19 to be arrested, sharing posts that erroneously claim vaccine shots contain \u2018cancer virus\u2019, and saying that anyone who is \u201cin on the globalist plan, the new world order, needs to be brought down\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nYet he is by no means the only high-profile example. Matt Le Tissier, one of his predecessors in a Southampton and England shirt, has used social media to augment arguments among conspiracy theorists that include the denial of the war in Ukraine and actors being used to fake what is happening in front of Western cameras.\nLe Tissier claims he has been pushed to the fringes by mainstream media companies because of his views. Support has come from Lambert but also from other ex-footballers, such as David Cotterill, the former Swansea City and Wales midfielder, who has used his Instagram account to make wild accusations over the existence of a network of celebrity paedophiles, climate change, Covid restrictions and that a Texas school shooting was a \u2018false flag\u2019 event.\nAnother former Liverpool player, Dejan Lovren, appeared to endorse the conspiracy theory that the Covid-19 pandemic was devised as a ploy to force vaccinations on the world\u2019s population. In 2020, he responded to a social media post thanking health workers by Bill Gates, the billionaire who helped fund vaccine research, by saying: \u201cGame over Bill. People are not blind.\u201d He has repeatedly promoted links to talks by David Icke, the former Coventry goalkeeper, who has long held a belief that the British Royal Family are a group of shape-shifting lizards.\nOn a similar theme, the former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas revealed in 2018 that he did not believe the Moon landings were real.\nThe key word in any cognitive reaction to conspiracy theories, according to the psychologist, is \u2018threat\u2019. They explain the brain like this: the threat part of the brain is the most potent, telling the drive system to do something about it. But the drive system is also the part of the brain that deals with reward, which makes people feel like they are eliminating a threat. This, therefore, makes people feel like they are achieving something. When that happens, it releases chemicals like serotonin and dopamine, making them feel better.\n\u201cIt gives people a purpose,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is, it becomes cyclical. The threat system says, \u2018You\u2019ve done something about it this time \u2014 what about next time? You feel good now but there\u2019s another threat around the corner.\u2019 This means the brain jumps back into drive.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a million miles away from the life of a Premier League football player, who has to push themselves to avoid being dropped or heckled by 60,000 spectators who revel in telling you that you\u2019re crap at your job. In a sporting life, that\u2019s the threat. You\u2019ve done well in one game, but there\u2019s always another to follow.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nSportspeople are susceptible to this world because of how carefully they need to manage their bodies in order to perform.\n\u201cClean eating became a fad 10 years ago or so,\u201d the psychologist says when asked to explain what can happen when sportspeople embrace alternative thinking. \u201cThat quickly becomes, \u2018Don\u2019t trust the professionals \u2014 take charge of what you put into your body.\u2019 This then becomes, \u2018Don\u2019t trust the professionals \u2014 they are in the pockets of \u2018big pharma\u2019\u2019. You throw in a pandemic in the middle of all this, along with various high-profile political scandals, and suddenly it manifests into not trusting anyone, claims about who controls the planet, and extreme views such as antisemitism.\u201d\nThese are big jumps, but look at the leap Le Tissier has made in a relatively short space of time, from small city champion and legendary Southampton No 7 to a war-denier in Ukraine, who in July, without providing evidence, suggested on Twitter a \u201ccommunist takeover is slyly being implemented\u201d.\nThe psychologist suggests retired footballers can find life difficult without the routine of training and matches. This can lead to them seeking a lost dressing room culture that can be found initially in a chat room or a forum.\n\u201cGiven golf courses were closed during the pandemic and there was nothing else to do, there was a sanctuary of sorts on the internet, where people seeking explanations for questions that had no answers seemed to find them. Such groups offer the illusion of certainty and safeness.\u201d\nThe problem, as Newert points out, is that real conspiracies do exist and have done through most of civilised history.\nIn Liverpool, particularly, you only need to remind people of the 1980s, when \u201cmanaged decline\u201d was suspected as a strategy of the United Kingdom\u2019s Conservative government, before official papers were released under the 30-year rule in 2011 revealing that Chancellor Geoffrey Howe had, at the very least, proposed the policy to then Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.\nAdvertisement\nMany people who lived in the city through this period would agree that there is enough evidence to believe the policy was, in fact, carried out. The decade finished with Hillsborough, the worst football disaster in British history, when the authorities aligned to blame fans. It would take more than a quarter of a century for a cover-up to be exposed in a courtroom and only in the past few years have some police forces started paying out damages to victims.\nIn some parts of Liverpool, it is still believed that the heroin epidemic of the same era was another strategy, aimed at doping the city up as the rot set in \u2014 preventing people in the haze from standing their ground.\nOnly a few hundred at most turned up outside Liverpool\u2019s town hall on Wednesday, but the psychologist believes the city is fertile ground for conspiracists because of its history and a wariness towards authority.\nThough it has not manifested into demonstrations, the current Conservative government\u2019s decision to send in commissioners to run an area that hasn\u2019t had a Tory councillor since 1997 has heightened suspicion amongst those with long memories.\nThis month, Icke hosted a talk in Liverpool\u2019s Greenbank Conference Centre and he wouldn\u2019t have organised that if he didn\u2019t think at least some people from the surrounding area would turn up.\nSuper conspiracies, the psychologist thinks, are intoxicating because they have no answers, which helps maintain an interest over a long period of time.\n\u201cThe awakening always feels just around the corner; that Scooby Doo moment, where the villain\u2019s sack is removed from his head,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst, there was 5G to consider. Then there were lockdowns and masks. Now there are 15-minute cities. It\u2019s a never-ending threat and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so difficult to escape from.\u201d\nLambert, whose football career ended in 2017 following 241 goals in 701 games for nine clubs across all levels of professional football in England, perhaps stands as testament to that.\nAdvertisement\nOn September 11, the 41-year-old used his Twitter page to start promoting the rally with a poster that could easily have been an advert for a ghost tour, where the town hall faded into the background of a ghoulish blue light.\n\u201cPeople of Liverpool, start researching 15 minute city\u2019s (sic),\u201d Lambert wrote, \u201cbecause they are coming our way very shortly if we allow it.\u201d\nThen, in capital letters, he added: \u201cWE DO NOT CONSENT!!\u201d\nA video from a garden followed three days later, was aimed at \u201cyou Scousers\u201d.\nAccording to Lambert, Liverpool\u2019s council was planning on \u201cdividing\u201d the city into 13 zones in an attempt to create greener and safer spaces for \u201cus, the people\u201d.\n\u201cIt is not, it is not,\u201d Lambert insisted. \u201cIt is a controlled tactic being implemented across this country as we speak. These are initial movements for 15-minute cities, all under the guise of climate change.\u201d\nLiverpool would be under the surveillance of cameras and, eventually, permanent barriers, according to Lambert. \u201cThis is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cUs, the people, will not stand for this control tactic.\u201d\nWhile Lambert did not provide evidence for these claims, the city council is adamant that such plans have never been discussed at any committee meeting and it does not form a part of its planning or policy.\nThe 15-minute city, an urban design concept which could be perceived as a fairly mundane strategy that has been moderately successful in other parts of the world for more than a decade, aims to provide everything that a resident supposedly needs within a 15-minute walk or bike ride.\nSince the start of 2023, however, it has been targeted by conspiracy theorists, who believe it to be a part of a malign international plot to control people\u2019s movement in the name of climate change. According to the protestors standing beside Sky, new cameras in bus lanes were evidence that this process had started in Liverpool.\nAdvertisement\nNot every person\u2019s life can be viewed through their social media output, but Lambert\u2019s might be revealing in terms of what it does not include over the first three years.\nHis Instagram page has been active since 2017 and until 2020, nearly all of his posts related to his family and football. If he was interested in politics, medicine, or social freedoms, he did not show it.\nThe nature of those posts began to change six months into the Covid-19 pandemic, specifically when Rishi Sunak told musicians they should retrain and find new jobs.\nLambert, like a lot of people, pushed back at this radical suggestion by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has since become the British prime minister.\nBy March 2021, he was posting about lockdowns, writing: \u201cNo new variant or blaming the unvaccinated!! NO MORE!!!\u201d\nLambert only joined Twitter in June 2023, attracting 10,000 followers since. His bio suggests he is \u201cfighting for my children\u2019s future\u201d, as an ex-footballer-turned-coach, though he does not mention he is employed by Wigan Athletic. It includes the hashtag #greatawakening.\nIn his first video post, he described himself as a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d before having a stab at explaining what he thought this phenomenon was.\n\u201cNo one has ever told us what the great awakening is,\u201d Lambert admitted.\nA month later, he released another, more succinct video, where he \u201cwithdrew his consent to be governed by any corrupt, compromised, belligerent parliament of government\u201d.\n\u201cI will not comply,\u201d he added.\nI had asked Lambert for an interview in July, to speak about his views, challenge them, and to see where they were rooted. Initially, he agreed, but the night before we were due to meet, he cancelled without any initial indication he wanted to reschedule. After being pressed on another date and promising to come back with a suggestion, he did not.\nAdvertisement\nIt became apparent on his Instagram page that two days before our original interview, he had attended a gathering with at least four other people, including Andrew Bridgen, the Member of Parliament who, earlier this year, was expelled from the Conservative Party for comparing Covid-19 vaccines to the Holocaust. He had also been found to have breached lobbying rules.\nAt the start of September, Hope Not Hate, the largest anti-fascist organisation in the United Kingdom, distributed a picture of Bridgen in Copenhagen with Tommy Robinson, arguably the most notorious far-right activist in the United Kingdom.\nThe organisers of the rally Lambert promoted and attended in Liverpool were the British Lions, a group which was spawned out of the Covid conspiracy \u201cfreedom\u201d movement.\nDespite using ancient law and sovereign language, Hope Not Hate says the organisation is not explicitly far-right, but says that some of its members have been seen at other far-right events.\nA leaflet handed out by the British Lions on Wednesday outlined, rather chaotically, all of the things they are challenging the government on. Some were rooted in reality, such as the attempt to criminalise rights to protest; others were unsubstantiated claims apparently designed to offer the impression of a super conspiracy.\nSo many of the origin stories for these groups and beliefs can be traced back to the pandemic, which Joe Mulhall, from Hope Not Hate, describes as an \u201cunprecedented opportunity for engagement with the conspiracy world\u201d.\nMulhall says conspiracists will ignore any differences when they meet believers of their secretive world. \u201cThe nuances seem tiny when they feel like they are conquering an external force. The enormity of the perceived threat means they will put aside political distinctions that traditionally might be a problem.\u201d\nNine summers ago, I watched Lambert cry tears of joy as he completed his dream move. He was at Melwood, Liverpool\u2019s old training ground, having just signed for the club.\nAdvertisement\nWhen I spoke to him briefly in July, he described it as the best moment of his life. I remember being delighted for him, as so many Liverpool supporters were. His story until this point had been one of crushing rejection and extraordinary revival, heaving himself from the floor of his release from the club he loved as a teenager to working his way back a couple of decades later. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this has happened,\u201d he told me.\nOn much colder reflection, his path might offer clues as to why he thinks the way he does now. Lambert was born in Kirkby, an overspill town seven miles inland from Liverpool\u2019s city centre, living in a maisonette opposite the old Kirkby Stadium, which for junior teams in the area was the equivalent of Wembley. With a notoriously hard shot, he was spotted by Liverpool scouts aged 10 and he spent five years in the junior ranks, rejecting opportunities to join Everton and Manchester United.\nIt was not a shock to him when he was told by Steve Heighway, Liverpool\u2019s academy director, that he was being released because of his lack of pace. Over the next few years, he had to adapt his game and this led to him playing in a variety of positions. He joined Blackpool as a right-back, but by the last year of his apprenticeship, he was a central midfielder. Two of those years had been under Nigel Worthington, but when Steve McMahon, the former Liverpool midfielder, took over, his fortunes changed. McMahon had been his father\u2019s hero, but within six months of his appointment as manager, Lambert was allowed to leave the club \u2014 unable to even get a game for the reserves. McMahon had seen ability but did not think Lambert\u2019s body would allow him to regularly play for 90 minutes.\nOn trial at Macclesfield Town, he was not being paid and this led to him getting a job at a beetroot factory. Aged 19, he was contemplating a career in the semi-professional ranks because he did not have a car and could not even afford the cost of the travel expenses to make it to training. Yet six months later, he was sold to Stockport County for what remains a club record fee of \u00a3300,000.\nLambert believes he was entitled to earn 10 per cent of that fee, but when he tried to buy a house, he learned that the money had disappeared into an agent\u2019s account. By the age of 19, it would be understandable if he had trust issues given he might feel let down by the club he loved, his father\u2019s hero, and the person supposedly representing him in this cruel, unforgiving sport.\nAt Stockport, Lambert found it hard to adapt to a deep-lying midfield role. The team was struggling and the fans turned on the players. As the most expensive signing, he bore the brunt and this led to him dropping a division to join League Two Rochdale, where he rediscovered a sense of purpose while playing as a centre-forward. He maintained his scoring habit after moving to Bristol Rovers and when Southampton were relegated into League One, new owners, with new money, enticed him to the south coast. There, the manager Alan Pardew asked him to lift his top up. Looking at his belly, he told him he was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d.\nDespite scoring the goals that helped Southampton accelerate back up the leagues and making friends with Le Tissier along the way, Lambert says the club wanted to sell him every summer.\nAdvertisement\nHe was desperate to prove them wrong and when he finally made it into the Premier League, aged 30, he had played almost 400 games across each of the divisions in the English football league. Yet in the opening game of that season, at champions Manchester City, he was left on the bench. The decision by manager Nigel Adkins suggested he didn\u2019t truly believe in him.\nListening to Lambert, you begin to realise how lonely football can be. He could only ever really trust himself: his talent and resilience. Regularly, those making decisions about the direction of his career did not. Even after proving himself in the Premier League, he felt as though international recognition with England only came out of respect for his record rather than his ability.\nOn his debut against Scotland, he was in \u201cdreamland\u201d after scoring the winner. He made it into England\u2019s squad for the 2014 World Cup squad but felt like a \u201cmascot\u201d after just three minutes of playing time. The lack of action meant he felt he needed less of a summer holiday as he began his Liverpool career. Despite being given five weeks off, he returned to Melwood after a fortnight, vowing to become the fittest he had ever been.\nIt proved to be a mistake because he needed the break. Aged 32, Lambert had never played a full season extending into a summer tournament before. Back on Merseyside, he felt heavy \u2014 like he didn\u2019t have any energy. On the club\u2019s pre-season tour of the United States, he struggled with the routine of training, playing and travelling.\nLiverpool\u2019s manager, Brendan Rodgers, had told Lambert that he was bringing in Alexis Sanchez to replace the outgoing Luis Suarez. Sanchez, however, never arrived. In the 2014-15 season, Liverpool missed Suarez terribly. In Sanchez\u2019s place, Rodgers bought Mario Balotelli despite vowing not to, and Balotelli\u2019s signing was a failure.\nLambert was under more pressure to deliver. His first Liverpool goal at Crystal Palace coincided with what turned into a bad team performance and a defeat. After just five months at the club, Rodgers wanted to move him on, but Lambert rejected the opportunity to join Palace before he almost went to Aston Villa. He never fulfilled that boyhood dream of scoring for Liverpool at Anfield.\nOut of the starting XI, his fitness got worse. He was less likely to affect a game if his chance did come.

But the British computer scientist warned that this future would happen only if people continued to have unfettered access to the basic infrastructure that powers the Internet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all predicated on a neutral network,\u201d said Mr. Berners-Lee, in a reference to the heated debate around so-called net neutrality, a principle according to which everyone should have equal access to online content.\n\u201cNet neutrality is really, really important,\u201d he added. \u201cNever before have you had something in the system that could throttle your app.\u201d\nThe intervention of the founder of the World Wide Web, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, comes as both sides of the net neutrality debate are sharpening their claws.\nCable providers and cellphone carriers are demanding that they be able to charge companies like Netflix for better access to their networks because of the high amounts of available bandwidth they use.\nIn contrast, content providers, search giants like Google and consumer groups have led an outcry against the proposals, saying that the creation of a two-tiered Internet would go against the fundamental principle of open access for all.\n\u201cWhy are so many people attracted to the concept of net neutrality? Because they fear the loss of the digital commons,\u201d Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive and a vocal defender of net neutrality, told a Brussels conference last week.\nSpeaking to an audience of telecom operators, he added, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to pay for your network if you don\u2019t have to pay for our content.\u201d\nThe debate has taken different paths in the United States and Europe as policy makers on either side of the Atlantic have taken opposing views on how net neutrality should be implemented.\nIn America, the Federal Communications Commission has proposed new rules that might allow companies to pay for improved access to Internet pipelines, though a final decision is expected to be made by the end of the year.\nIn contrast, European lawmakers passed legislation this year guaranteeing equal access to online content for everyone. But while the decision is a blow to local carriers, there is still time for companies to lobby for changes to the rules before they are completed sometime next year.\n\u201cHigher prices for higher speeds are acceptable, but not at the price of others,\u201d Andrus Ansip, the nominee to lead the digital agenda at the European Commission, told lawmakers in Brussels on Monday.\nAlong with unobstructed access to online content, Mr. Berners-Lee also emphasized on Wednesday that people must have greater control of how governments and companies use their data.\nHis comments come as companies like Google and Facebook are under increased scrutiny over how they access \u2013 and sell \u2013 individuals\u2019 information. Public awareness about online privacy has also skyrocketed after the revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about the surveillance efforts of American and British security agencies.\n\u201cThe idea that privacy is dead is hopelessly sad,\u201d said Mr. Berners-Lee, a reference to comments from the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who said that people were now comfortable with sharing their lives online. \u201cPrivacy is really important.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Consumption in the United States was stable after the Sept. 11 attacks, but investment fell.\nStocks markets typically recover within weeks and on Monday, they were flat in Europe and up more than 1 percent in the United States.\nBut this reaction may belie the true cost of terrorism. Many regard the events in Paris as part of a continuum. The attacks could also have far-reaching implications for the future of the eurozone and companies there.\nThey could add to the pressure to close borders and reignite a debate about privacy and surveillance that will have a big effect on technology companies. The indirect costs are difficult to measure.\nOne reminder that the scale of economic damage could be much higher is an academic study that showed that Israel\u2019s per capita G.D.P. would have been 8.6 percent higher in the period from 1994 to 2003 had there been peace.\nSETBACKS CAST HARSH LIGHT ON MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR | The spotlight on the district attorney of Manhattan has been more intense since\nhe suffered several setbacks in white-collar trials,\nMatthew Goldstein reports in DealBook.\nLawyers have been wondering whether the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., made financial trials too complex and whether he has been aggressively pursuing matters that might have been better off treated as civil disputes.\nMr. Vance conceded that the trial of three former executives of the once-mighty law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf could have been handled better. The men were accused of orchestrating an accounting fraud and he said that if there was a new trial for them, it would have to be \u201csimpler and shorter.\u201d\nThe trial took four months and the jury spent 21 days grappling with the 151 charges against the men. The deadlock now means that Mr. Vance has to decide whether the men should be retried and how to streamline any new proceedings.\nHe is expected to decide by Dec. 7, when the parties are scheduled to return to court.\nIn another setback for Mr. Vance, in June, a jury acquitted two senior officers of Abacus Federal Savings Bank in a mortgage fraud case. Mr. Vance charged the Chinatown bank, and more than a dozen employees, with participating in a \u201csystematic\u201d scheme to sell fraudulent mortgages to Fannie Mae.\nQuestions have emerged over the trial readiness of his prosecutors after prosecutors working for Mr. Vance said the trial had been compromised by \u201cunanticipated witness issues and evidentiary issues.\u201d\nThe admission is of little comfort for some of the defendants who have spent more than five years dealing with the investigation.\n\u201cIf you care more about the press conference than the proof, you end up charging people and institutions that you shouldn\u2019t and overreaching in terms of theories,\u201d said Kevin R. Puvalowski, the main lawyer for Abacus. \u201cMy clients spent millions of dollars on this investigation and trial, and it seriously damaged their business for years.\u201d\nMr. Vance declined to elaborate on the court filing but said his office had secured guilty pleas from eight employees of the bank, which was evidence that crimes were committed.\n\u201cWe have not shied away from tough or challenging cases,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cWe are going to do tough cases, and some of those cases the jury is not going to agree with us. That is the reality of prosecution.\u201d\nA ROCKY QUARTER FOR HEDGE FUNDS | Thousands of hedge funds have disclosed which stocks they bought in regulatory disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the third quarter and many of them lost money for their clients,\nAlexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook.\nGrantham Mayo Van Otterloo, the large hedge fund that Jeremy Grantham helped found, increased its stake in Valeant just as it came under siege. Viking Global, the hedge fund led by O. Andreas Halvorsen, also added Valeant stock to its portfolio.\nValueAct, the multibillion-dollar firm founded by Jeffrey W. Ubben, is the top shareholder. John A. Paulson also holds 8.9 million shares, though he sold 110,000.\nThe filings are an imperfect window into firms\u2019 finances, but they do show that Wall Street\u2019s biggest and wealthiest money managers invest in herds.\nLeon G. Cooperman of Omega Advisors, Daniel S. Loeb of Third Point, York Capital Management and Coatue Management were among the investors who added Kraft Heinz as a new position in their portfolios during the quarter.\nMr. Loeb, Citadel, York Capital and Jana Partners, the hedge fund founded by Barry Rosenstein, all held stakes in Baxter International, the medical equipment maker.\nStarwood Hotels and the renewable energy company SunEdison were two other favorites among investors.\nON THE AGENDA | Walmart will hold a conference call on its third-quarter results at 7 a.m. Data on consumer prices in October will be released at 8:30 a.m. Industrial production data will be released at 9:15 a.m. The latest NAHB/Wells Fargo housing market index data will be released at 10 a.m. The Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing at 10 a.m. titled \u201cDodd-Frank Five Years Later: What Have We Learned from Conflict Minerals Reporting?\u201d The second day of the Global Financial Leadership Conference starts at 9 a.m. Speakers include Dick Costolo, the former chief of Twitter, and Elizabeth Holmes, the chief of Theranos.\nMARRIOTT\u2019S DEAL TO BUY STARWOOD HOTELS | Marriott International was not among the rumored suitors when Starwood Hotels and\nResorts Worldwide put itself up for sale, but it looks as if the decline in hotel stocks and stronger competition from Airbnb have made consolidation seem more attractive,\nLeslie Picker reports in DealBook.\nHyatt was a competitive bidder almost to the end, but ultimately the Starwood board thought Marriott\u2019s stock had greater potential.\nMarriott announced that it would acquire Starwood for $11.9 billion in stock and $340 million in cash. The deal would create the world\u2019s largest hotel company, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels. The agreement represented a premium of about 6 percent above the average of where Starwood\u2019s stock had traded in the 20 days before Nov. 13.\nThe premium was lower than expected, given the competitive sales process, and Starwood\u2019s shares fell, while Marriott\u2019s gained.\nMarriott\u2019s chief executive, Arne M. Sorenson, said the deal promoted growth and value creation, but it was not evident from the figures,\nJeffrey Goldfarb writes in Breakingviews. The deal looks decidedly defensive.\nShares in Starwood and its rivals have slipped steadily, despite regular consolidation.\nMarriott is paying a premium under 20 percent, worth about $1.9 billion, based on its stock price before media reports of potential buyers in October.\nIt anticipates about $200 million in annual cost savings. Once taxed and capitalized, these could be worth some $1.3 billion today.\nMarriott is paying more in premium than is justified by its stated savings, and Starwood investors have a fairly stingy premium to fall back on, Mr. Goldfarb writes.

Again.\nGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where efforts to curtail the nation\u2019s domestic spying have stalled in Congress, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York will find himself among some much-needed friends, and Republican leaders in the House stuck with an (almost) all-male lineup of committee leaders. Plus: Should Mitt Romney grow a beard?\nRepublicans have announced their new leadership lineup, and its makeup is very much like the old one \u2014 lacking women.\nOnly one of the House of Representatives committees in the next Congress will be headed by a chairwoman rather than a chairman.\nCommittee leaders tend to have greater influence and fund-raising power within their party, and of the 19 standing committees and the two select committees, 20 will be led by men and one by a woman.\nCandice S. Miller of Michigan will remain the chairwoman of the Administration Committee. (It\u2019s something like the chamber\u2019s general manager and accountant, and it oversees the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian and the National Zoo.)\nThe issue has come up before. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich made a high-profile plea for more diversity in 2012 in an interview with Jay Leno on the \u201cTonight\u201d show. Mr. Gingrich called it a \u201creal problem for the Republican Party.\u201d\n\u201cOutreach is when five white guys have a meeting and call you,\u201d he said. \u201cInclusion is if you\u2019re in the meeting.\u201d\nWomen fare better in the party\u2019s House leadership, where three of the eight members are women. One of them, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, told The National Journal in October that the lack of chairwomen was because \u201cwomen came in and they haven\u2019t stayed in as long as the men have.\u201d\nHaving just won the Senate majority, Republicans may not name their committee leaders until January, after the Louisiana race is settled. In the current Democratic-controlled Senate, 6 of the 16 standing committees are led by women, and women run both the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Select Committee on Ethics.\n\u2014 Steve Kenny\nA House Tradition Returns, With No Cameras Allowed\nNewt Gingrich loves being in front of a camera. That was no less true 20 years ago, when he was speaker of the House, than it is now.\nBack then, his rather colorful performances turned a decades-long tradition of low-key daily press briefings into free-swinging televised theater that often veered far from the Republicans\u2019 message of the day.\nThat made the generation of Republican leaders that followed him a little wary. Representative Eric Cantor did away with such briefings altogether when he was majority leader.\nNow, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican from California who is the current leader, wants to bring them back in the more traditional low-key, pen-and-pad way. With no cameras.\nIt\u2019s a quaint notion in the digital era. Let\u2019s see how long it lasts.\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\nHaving Promised Openness, McConnell Shuts Down a Debate\nMitch McConnell has promised that Republicans will run a more open Senate after being stifled by Democrats for years. There will be spirited debate, he said, and lawmakers from both parties will be given a fair chance to shape legislation.\nBut it was Mr. McConnell who was doing the stifling yesterday as a proposed overhaul of the National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance program died in the lame-duck session. It was an abrupt case of role reversal.\nSome Republicans supported the bipartisan legislation, but Mr. McConnell rallied the opposition, arguing that any curbs on the N.S.A. program would represent a threat to national security.\nDemocrats pounced, saying that Mr. McConnell, at the first opportunity, passed up an invitation to engage in exactly the kind of floor fight he said he would relish. They suggested it didn\u2019t bode well for next year.\nMcConnell aides dismissed the objections, noting that the bill was not reviewed by the Judiciary Committee and that Democrats were trying to jam it through over the course of a few crowded days.\nStill, Mr. McConnell has made extensive commitments on how he intends to operate the Senate as majority leader, and his ability to fulfill them will be followed closely.\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\nEscape From New York: A Washington Getaway for de Blasio\nIt\u2019s been a bumpy week for Bill de Blasio. But a little dose of Washington might help.\nThe New York City mayor is in the capital today to bask in the company of his fellow progressives, stopping by the White House to chat with Valerie Jarrett before attending a confab with liberal A-listers like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the housing secretary, and Senator Elizabeth Warren.\nThe visit is another sign that Mr. de Blasio, 11 months into his first term, is intent on burnishing his national profile. But it could also serve as a much-needed respite for the mayor, who is coping with the departure of a key aide with messy personal troubles and a new poll showing a stark divide in his approval rating between whites and blacks.\nDe Blasio watchers will be wondering if the perennially tardy mayor \u2014 who cited a \u201cvery rough night\u201d after missing a memorial service last week with grieving relatives of plane crash victims \u2014 arrives in Washington in time for his first stop, an 8:30 breakfast interview with Mike Allen of Politico.\nBut there is zero chance the mayor will be late for a news conference \u2014 because he isn\u2019t having one. Mr. de Blasio will return to New York on Wednesday night without taking questions from reporters.\n\u2014 Michael M. Grynbaum\nWhat We\u2019re Watching Today\nPresident Obama speaks at a digital learning conference and then signs the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014 into law.

We Can\u2019t Either.\nAs potential presidential candidates use the holidays to contemplate their futures, they will seek advice from friends, family and those who have been there before them.\nSome are likely to pick the brain of Mitt Romney, who has twice run for president.\nMr. Romney, speaking at Brigham Young University on Tuesday, shared some of the lessons he has learned: Shorten anecdotes, don\u2019t speak so fast and stick with the best applause lines.\nHe said he heard a different take from voters: Shed the image of a conservative corporate consultant and, well, bring sexy back.\n\u201cI was told to take bigger steps when I walk, to show that I\u2019m young and athletic,\u201d said Mr. Romney, who is now 67. \u201cAnother said I should stop shaving for a few days.\u201d\nStill, he is a devout Mormon \u2013 a religion that currently frowns on beards (but hasn\u2019t always) \u2013 and he has hung on to his razor, and his blazer.\nScruff may be in, but we\u2019ve always thought of Mr. Romney as more Tabernacle than trendy.\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\nWhat We\u2019re Reading Elsewhere\nJeb Bush speaks at a Washington education conference tomorrow, and some on Capitol Hill are calling it \u201cthe unofficial beginning of the 2016 election cycle,\u201d The Wall Street Journal says.\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi has angered many Democrats by refusing to let Representative Tammy Duckworth of Illinois vote by proxy, according to The Hill. Ms. Duckworth, a veteran who lost both legs in Iraq, is pregnant, and her doctor has forbidden her to travel to Washington.\nThe tension between President Obama and his generals over Iraq recalls the discussions of Vietnam in the early days of the Kennedy administration, Fredrik Logevall and Gordon M.

It is also adding an encryption technology, called Perfect Forward Secrecy, that thwarts eavesdropping.\nThe company is also scrambling the links between its data centers in an effort to assure users and foreign governments that their data is not free for the National Security Agency\u2019s taking.\nThe company says encryption and Perfect Forward Secrecy will become the default setting for users by the end of 2014.\nThe announcement follows similar efforts by Google, Twitter, Mozilla, Facebook and Yahoo. But Microsoft said it will also go several steps further, by making a contractual promise to business and government customers that it will alert them if it receives legal orders related to their data \u2014 and fight every gag order in court.\nMicrosoft will also open up so-called transparency centers, where governments can inspect its products code for back doors.\nBradford L. Smith, Microsoft\u2019s general counsel, said the company had long considered such efforts, but was jolted to action after recent reports that the N.S.A. may be gaining access to companies\u2019 data without their knowledge.\n\u201cThe idea that the government may be hacking into corporate data centers was a bit like an earthquake, sending shock waves across the tech sector,\u201d Mr. Smith said in an interview. \u201cWe concluded that we better assume that there might be such an attempt at Microsoft, or has already been.\u201d\nThe end goal, Mr. Smith said, is to force would-be snoops to go to court \u2014 not hack into its data centers \u2014 for customers\u2019 data. \u201cWe all want to live in a world that is safe and secure, but we also want to live in a country that is governed by the Constitution.\u201d\nAnd therein lies the rub. Microsoft\u2019s efforts \u2014 and for that matter Google\u2019s, Twitter\u2019s, Mozilla\u2019s, Facebook\u2019s and Yahoo\u2019s \u2014 still do not prevent the government from gaining access to their data through a court order. And some security experts point out that even if companies like Microsoft allow outsiders to inspect their code, that only eliminates one mode of attack; snoops could still find holes in other parts of the system.\nTo make governments\u2019 jobs more difficult, executives at Lavabit and Silent Circle, two secure message providers, have been lobbying major Internet companies to adopt a new Dark Mail e-mail protocol that would encrypt user data and metadata in such a way that it would leave the keys with the user, not the provider. Dark Mail would thereby force governments, or hackers, to go straight to the user to unscramble their data.\nBut Mike Janke, a co-founder at Silent Circle, said he was skeptical they would adopt the protocol because companies rely on access to user data to serve up targeted ads.\n\u201cThe real friction point is that Yahoo, Google and Microsoft make money mining off free email,\u201d Mr. Janke said in an interview. \u201cThey say they\u2019re concerned about user privacy. Now we\u2019ll see if they really care.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Now, under the terms of the new agreement, the government will allow companies that are older than two years old to disclose the number of FISA orders they receive in increments of 1,000. They can publish that number in increments of 250, if they lump the number of FISA requests with the number of so-called National Security Letters they receive.\nCompanies will also be allowed to release the number of customer \u201cselectors\u201d \u2013 user names, email addresses or Internet addresses, for instance \u2013 that the government sought information about and will be allowed to publish the information every six months, with a six-month delay.\nBecause of those amended rules, Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft agreed to dismiss their lawsuits before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\nBut Mr. Levison said the number of FISA requests was less important than the kind of information sought by each request. If a FISA order asks a company to turn over its source code or encryption keys, for example, one order could affect thousands of users.\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking companies to do some pretty scary things, well beyond what they would ask for in a normal criminal order and doing it because there is no civilian oversight,\u201d Mr. Levison said. \u201cWhat we really need is information about the means and methods the government is using to conduct these investigations.\u201d\nOther privacy advocates note that though it seems like bigger technology companies are throwing their younger counterparts to the wolves, the belief that there is no legal precedent for Monday\u2019s agreement means start-ups are still free to mount their own legal challenges to disclosure restrictions.\n\u201cWe were disappointed that the technology companies abandoned their fight in FISC which we believed they were going to win,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, a staff lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, referring to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. \u201cThe start-ups are still free to raise their own challenges, which, frankly, they would win.\u201d\n\u201cThe First Amendment goes a lot further than today\u2019s settlement,\u201d Mr. Cardozo added.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Machines will then use powerful algorithms to pair those photos with existing biometric profiles.\nThe Janus program isn\u2019t alone: Facial-recognition technology is quickly becoming a mainstay of commercial and government surveillance systems. While it can provide benefits in automation and security, it is also a threat to privacy. Sophisticated algorithms can already extract information about your gender, age and even mood from a single image, and then link those physical attributes to commercial or government databases.\nThis powerful surveillance technology is cheap, ubiquitous and unregulated.\nMy project, CV Dazzle, explores how fashion can be used as camouflage from face-detection technology, the first step in automated face recognition. The name is derived from a type of World War I naval camouflage called Dazzle, which used cubist-inspired designs to break apart the visual continuity of a battleship and conceal its orientation and size. Likewise, CV Dazzle uses avant-garde hairstyling and makeup designs to break apart the continuity of a face. Since facial-recognition algorithms rely on the identification and spatial relationship of key facial features, like symmetry and tonal contours, one can block detection by creating an \"anti-face.\"\nThis design combines unconventional hairstyling and makeup to create an anti-face, an attempt to block facial recognition software.\nFacial-recognition algorithms expect symmetry between the left and right sides of the face. By developing an asymmetrical look, you may decrease your probability of being detected.\nSome algorithms will analyze gradations in skin tone and texture. This process helps locate the facial region, but it relies on assumptions about what typical facial features look like. To confuse this process, use hair or makeup that contrasts with your skin tone and apply makeup in unusual tones and directions: light colors on dark skin, dark colors on light skin.\nSome algorithms rely on the nose bridge area as a key facial marker. Use hairstyling or fashion accessories to conceal the area above the nose and between the eyes.\nUsing the tips above, create your own camouflaged look. To get you started, below are two additional looks that thwart detection software through the use of asymmetry, tonal inverse and nose bridge concealment.\nAvoid masks as they are illegal in some areas. Avoid relying on sunglasses or facial hair, as they are common features that are incorporated into most algorithms.\nFor more photos, test results and style advice, visit cvdazzle.com.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Id. at 6-16. It also granted a motion by the Government for leave to file for an extension of the prior order, in Docket No. under which this surveillance was previously authorized. Id. at 20-21. Leave to TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN Derived from: Application to the USFISC in the Docket Number captioned above\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. TOP SECRETI/COMINTHNOFORN Approved for Public Release seek an extension was granted in order to \"give the government a reasonable amount of time to work in good faith toward the preparation and submission of a revised and a supplemented application that would meet the requirements of FISA as described in this order and opinion.\" Id, at 21. On April 5, 2007, the Government obtained from another judge of this Court an extension of the order in Docket No. Under that extension, current surveillance authorities expire at 5:00 p.m. on May 31, 2007. The April 3 Order also required the Government to submit periodic reports regarding its efforts to prepare and submit a revised and supplemented application. In its report submitted on April 20, 2007, the Government articulated a new legal theory, under which it proposed that the Court would make probable cause findings for each telephone number and e-mail address identified at the time of the application as one at which surveillance would be directed, but that the Government could initiate electronic surveillance of later-discovered numbers and addresses, subject to reporting to the Court under 50 U.S.C. & 1805(c)(3). On May 24, 2007, the Government filed a revised and supplemented application that seeks, inter alia, authority to conduct electronic surveillance of more than identified telephone numbers and e-mail addresses and to initiate electronic TOP SECRETHEOMINTHNOFORN 2\nApproved for Public Release All withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. TOP SECRETICOMINTINOFORN surveillance of later-discovered numbers and addresses on the theory noted above. On May 30, 2007, the Government submitted a Supplemental Declaration of Lieutenant General Keith B. Alexander, U.S. Army, Director of the National Security Agency (b)(3); (b)(6) (NSA), as well as a Declaration of NSA. Both the revised and supplemented application and the Supplemental Declaration filed on May 30 contain individual statements of the Government's factual basis for asserting probable cause to believe that each identified telephone number and e-mail address is being used, or about to be used, by one of the targeted foreign powers. I have reviewed each of these statements of facts, which were provided on a rolling basis prior to their formal submission. This Order addresses the revised and supplemented application, as further supplemented by the declarations filed on May 30, 2007, and by the Notice of Withdrawal, in Part, of Application for an Order Authorizing Electronic Surveillance filed on May 31, 2007 (the application). The Court continues to exercise jurisdiction over this matter for the reasons stated in the April 3 Order at page 8 n.12. Having given full consideration to the matters set forth in the Government's application and all of the Government's other filings in this docket, as well as the hearings I have conducted with the Government, I find as follows: TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN 3\nAll withheld information exempt under fand 46/3) Aband Alexceptesohanise POFORN Approved for Public Release 1.

TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN WHEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to the authority conferred on this Court by the Act, that the application of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance, as described in the application, is GRANTED, and it is FURTHER ORDERED, as follows (50 U.S.C. $ 1805(c)-(e)]: I. The United States is authorized to conduct electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information as defined by 50 U.S.C. $ 1801(e)(1)(A) and (B), including the incidental acquisition of other foreign intelligence information as defined by 50 U.S.C. S 1801(e)(1)(C) and (2) at the facilities described below, subject to the minimization procedures specified in paragraph 4 above and specifically detailed in paragraph IV below, for a period of ninety days, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.

TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN 9\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. TOP SECRETH/COMINTINOFORN Approved for Public Release While the provisions of 50 U.S.C. $ 1805 are in tension with one another, it appears that the intent of Congress, when amending these provisions in 2001 and 2006, was to authorize multipoint or \"roving\" surveillance of a target that is actively avoiding surveillance, and to provide judicial oversight of such surveillance through the notice 4 requirement in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(c)(3).* This Court's practice has generally been to Nevertheless, I conclude that authorizing 3 4 On the one hand, 50 U.S.C. $ 1805(a)(3)(B) requires that the judge find probable cause to believe that each of the facilities at which surveillance is directed is being used, or is about to be used by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. On the other hand, 50 U.S.C. $ 1805(c)(1)(B) clearly envisions cases in which the Court's order would authorize electronic surveillance of facilities, under circumstances where the nature and location of the facilities were unknown at the time the application was approved. Similarly, the notice requirement in 50 U.S.C. 1805(c)(3) indicates that an order can, consistent with 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(c)(1)(B), authorize electronic surveillance of \u201cany new facility or place,\" and suggests that the order can authorize the government to determine whether \"each new facility or place\" is being used, or is about to be used, by the target of surveillance, subject to prompt notice to, and review by, this Court. The legislative history for the USA PATRIOT Act's amendment to $ 1805(c)(2)(B) states that the new language was \"included... to modify [FISA) to allow surveillance to follow a person who uses multiple communications devices or locations, a modification which conforms FISA to the parallel criminal procedures for electronic surveillance in 18 U.S.C. $ 2518(11)(b).\" 147 Cong.

Conf. Rep. No. 107-328, at 24 (2001). The notice requirements set forth in \u00a7 1805(c)(3) were added in 2006 by section 108(b)(4) of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, Pub, L.

TOP SECRETHEOMINTI/NOFORN Approved for Public Release such surveillance in this case is consistent with the provisions of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805, as well as the intent of Congress, and is particularly appropriate where, as is the case here, the national security interests of the Government are great, and the impact of the surveillance on the Constitutional rights of United States persons is, or can be, minimized. Therefore, in accordance with 50 U.S.C. $ 1805(c)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1805(c)(3), the United States is authorized to conduct electronic surveillance of any other telephone numbers or e-mail the nature and location of which are not specified herein because they were unknown to the NSA as of May 24, 2007 (the date the application was filed), where there is probable cause to believe that each additional telephone number or e-mail is being used, or is about to be used, This authority shall be limited to the surveillance of telephone numbers and e-mail which the NSA reasonably believes are being used, or about to be used, by persons outside the United States and shall not include the surveillance of telephone numbers and e-mail that the TOP SECRETHCOMINT//NOFORN 11\nAll withheld information exempt under OrnSECRETDESMINATINOFORN as otherwise noted. Approved for Public Release NSA reasonably believes are being used, or about to be used, by United States persons, as defined in 50 U.S.C. & 1801(i). (c). In this case, the Government has also asked for specific authority to acquire certain electronic communications that relate to or refer to an e-mail that is targeted for surveillance under this Order. For example, the Government argues that it should be allowed to acquire any e-mail communication that mentions a targeted e-mail even though the communication is to and from other e-mail not currently under electronic surveillance. After careful consideration of the Government's arguments, the Court holds that, in the limited and carefully considered circumstances described below, there is probable cause to believe that internet communications relating to a previously targeted e-mail are themselves being sent and/or received by one of the targeted foreign powers, and thus those communications may be acquired by the NSA. At the same time, any e-mail facilities that were involved in sending or receiving such communications may not be further targeted absent a further examination by the NSA of the evidence supporting probable cause that involves, among other things, looking at the actual content of the 5 The Government identifies these as \"abouts\" or \"refered to communications \"For example if an unknown Memorandum of Law at 4.

TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN original intercepted communication which refers to the previously targeted e-mail This holding, albeit novel, is consistent with the overall statutory requirements; it requires the Government to promptly report and provide appropriate justification to the Court; and it supplies the Government with a necessary degree of agility and flexibility in tracking the targeted foreign powers. This Court will be able to ultimately determine whether the electronic surveillance was proper. Therefore, in accordance with 50 U.S.C.S 1805(c)(1)(B) and S 1805(C)(3), the United States is further authorized to conduct electronic surveillance, as follows: (i) by acquiring internet communications that contain a reference to an e-mail that is subject to electronic surveillance under this Order at the time of acquisition (targeted ), under one of the following circumstances: 6 For example, if the user of targeted account under this authority. The government's application does not ask separately for authority to initiate electronic surveillance under these circumstances, Memorandum of Law, at 2, apparently on the theory that is actually electronic surveillance directed at the already targeted However, I conclude that electronic surveillance is directed at the newly identified facility in cases where that facility is separate and distinct from the already targeted TOP SECRETHEOMINTINOFORN 13\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. TOP SECRET\u0130 COMINT//NOFORN Approved for Public Release Therefore, separate authority is required to direct this form of electronic surveillance at a new facility, i.e., a separate and I grant such authority here. For purposes of this Order, For example, if the user See Memorandum of Law, at 3. The government's application does not ask separately for authority to initiate electronic surveillance of under these circumstances. Id., at 2. However, for the same reasons discussed in footnote 6 it seems to me that separate authority is required to initiate electronic surveillance of a separate facility. and I grant such authority here.

TOP SECRET COMINTHNOFORN 15\nApproved for Public Release All withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. TOP SECRETHCOMINTINOFORN For each new facility at which the Government directs electronic surveillance under sub-paragraphs (b) or (c)(ii) above, the Government shall provide notice to the Court in accordance with 50 U.S.C. $ 1805(c)(3) within twenty-one days after the date on which such surveillance begins and in accordance with the following reporting schedule. The first such report shall be filed on Wednesday, June 13, 2007; this first report shall provide notice of newly discovered telephone numbers and e-mail for which the Government initiated electronic surveillance from May 24, 2007 (i.e., the date on which this application was filed) through June 2, 2007. Subsequent reports shall be filed on a weekly basis each Wednesday (or on Tuesday if Wednesday is a national holiday), and will cover surveillance initiated during an earlier one-week period. For example, on June 20, 2007, the Government shall provide a report on surveillance initiated from June 3, 2007, through June 10, 2007; on June 27, 2007, the Government shall provide a report on surveillance initiated from June 11, 2007, through June 18, 2007; and so on. Such notice shall include: (A) the nature and location of each new facility or place at which electronic surveillance is directed; (B) the facts and circumstances relied upon by the United States to justify its belief that the new facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed TOP SECRET//COMINT//NOFORN 16\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) STAB INICS otherwis SEORN Pop Approved for Public Release is or was being used, or is about to be used, by a target of surveillance (for surveillance conducted pursuant to paragraph I(C)(ii), the notice shall include the facts and circumstances relied upon by the United States to justify its continued surveillance of that facility); (C) a statement of any proposed minimization procedures that differ from those contained in the original application or order, that may be necessitated by a change in the facility or place at which the electronic surveillance is directed; and (D) the total number of electronic surveillances that have been or are being conducted under the authority of this Order. In accordance with 50 U.S.C. S 1805(C)(3), I find that the Government has established good cause to justify the twenty-one day period described above. In addition, for each new facility at which the Government directs electronic surveillance under sub-paragraph (c)(i) above, the Government shall provide notice to the Court in accordance with 50 U.S.C. & 1805(C)(3) within sixty days after the date on which such surveillance begins and in accordance with the following reporting schedule. The first such report shall be filed on Wednesday, July 30, 2007; this first report shall provide notice of each new facility for which the Government initiated electronic surveillance from May 31, 2007 (i.e., the date of this Order) through July 15, 2007.

In accordance with 50 U.S.C.S 1805(c)(3), I find that the Government has established good cause to justify the sixty day period described above. The Court may order the Government to immediately cease electronic surveillance of any facility as to which it deems the facts and circumstances relied upon by the Government to be inadequate. In addition, the Government shall continue to file emergency FISA applications pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(f)(or alternatively, a motion to amend) if it seeks authority to conduct electronic surveillance, as described herein, of additional telephone numbers and e-mail that the Government believes are being used, TOP SECRETHCOMINTI/NOFORN 18\nApproved for Public Release All withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted.

Approved for Public Release TOP SECRETHEOMINTHORCON,NOFORN/X1 UNITED STATES FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT : Docket No.: ORDER AND MEMORANDUM OPINION This matter is before the Court on the Motion to Amend filed by the government in the above-captioned docket on July 27, 2007. This motion concerns just one of the difficult issues presented by this effort to apply FISA to a complex, large-scale surveillance program. This case has required, and continues to require, an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort by NSA, the Department of Justice, and this Court, notwithstanding that it concerns electronic surveillance that is overwhelmingly directed at non-U.S. persons operating outside of the United States. In my view (a view I believe to be shared by all of the judges of this Court), legislative action is urgently needed to refocus the FISA process on surveillances that - unlike this one - significantly involve interests protected by the Fourth Amendment. - Background This order is intended to clarify and supplement the earlier orders entered in this docket on April 3, 2007, and May 31, 2007. The May 31 order authorized electronic surveillance of particular, identified telephone numbers and e-mail addresses, on the basis of my finding probable cause to believe that such numbers and addresses were being or about to be used by one of the targets.

It established procedures that were novel and were designed to meet the complex requirements of insuring that the requested surveillance by the NSA complied with the statutory provisions of FISA. That order also provided for adding additional numbers or addresses: in accordance with 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(c)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1805(C)(3), the United States is authorized to conduct electronic surveillance of any other telephone numbers or email the nature and location of which are not specified herein because they were unknown to the NSA as of May 24. 2007 (the date the application was filed), where there is probable cause to believe that each additional telephone number or e-mail is being used, or is TOP SECRETHEOMINTHOREON,NOFORN1X1 Page 1\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted.

This authority shall be limited to the surveillance of telephone numbers and e-mail which the NSA reasonably believes are being used, or about to be used, by persons outside of the United States and shall not include the surveillance of telephone numbers and e-mail that the NSA reasonably believes are being used, or about to be used, by U.S. persons, as defined in 50 U.S.C. $ 1801(1). Id. at 11-12 (emphasis added). That order also established a schedule for the government to submit, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. $ 1805(c)(3), weekly reports on the initiation of electronic surveillance of such additional facilities. Id. at 16-17. Upon reviewing these reports, several judges of this Court have ordered supplementation with regard to whether NSA had knowledge prior to May 24, 2007, that would call into question whether it properly invoked the above-quoted provision of the May 31 Order.' The pending motion seeks clarification of it means, under that provision, for the nature and location\" of a facility to have been \"unknown to the NSA as of May 24, 2007.\" I conducted a hearing on this motion on the record on August 2, 2007. a Discussion With the benefit of some two months of implementation, it can be seen that this provision of the May 31 Order requires clarification. As stated in the motion, and further addressed at the hearing, NSA has encountered different situations in which it has found the proper interpretation of this provision to be uncertain. The following hypothetical examples illustrate some of these concerns: 1 See No. Orders Dated June 22, 2007 (J. Kazen); July 6, 2007 (J. Bates); July 6, 2007 (J. Benson); July 13, 2007 (J. Scullin); July 20, 2007 (J. Kollar-Kotelly). For a number of reported facilities, the government was also ordered to supplement the stated basis for finding probable cause to believe that a targeted foreign power was using or about to use the facility. The adequacy of the probable cause statements is not presented by the instant motion. (b)(3); (b)(6) 2 For example, an NSA official, testified at the hearing that NSA maintains (continued...) TOP SECRETHEOMINTHORCON,NOFORNIXL Page 2\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. Approved for Public Release TOP SECRETHCOMINTHOREON,NOFORN/X1 I am persuaded that, in all three of these scenarios, NSA could properly initiate surveillance under the above-quoted authority for \u201clater-identified\u201d facilities. For purposes of this provision of the May 31 Order, NSA obtains knowledge of the \"nature and location\" of a facility when it first assesses that there is probable cause to believe that the facility is being used or about to be used by a targeted foreign power. Thus, \"known\" in this context applies to both the fact that the target has been found or identified, and a \"connecting-the-dots\u201d or understanding of that fact's significance. A more limited interpretation of this provision would preclude NSA from initiating surveillance under this authority for a facility that, even with the exercise of due diligence, it could not have presented in the original application. I conclude that, under the limited circumstances where this authority applies - only to facilities reasonably believed to be used by non-U.S. persons outside of the United States, on behalf of one of the targeted foreign powers -- it is appropriate to grant the government as much latitude in initiating surveillance as the statute can reasonably be construed to permit. 3 ?...continued) databases (b)(3); (b)(6) At the hearing, testified that, since February 2007, NSA had tasked approximately e-mail addresses and phone numbers for non-FISA collection under Executive Order No. 12333 because they were associated with one of the targeted foreign powers than the total number of facilities targeted for surveillance under the probable cause standards of the May 31 Order. TOP SECRETHEOMINTHORCON,NOFORNIX1 Page 3\nAll withheld information exempt under (b)(1) and (b)(3) except as otherwise noted. Approved for Public Release TOP SECRETHCOMINTHORCON,NOFORNIXI However, I am not able to grant the government the precise relief that its motion requests. The motion proposes that a facility should be eligible for this \"later-identified\" authority if it had not been the subject of a FISA application or emergency authorization prior to May 24, 2007, or tasked for collection under the authority granted in Docket No. or under the Terrorist Surveillance Program as of December 31, 2006. Motion at 4-5. These by their terms, would not preclude the strategic withholding from pre-surveillance judicial review of facilities that were already intended to be subjected to the FISA surveillance at the time the application was submitted. There is no reason to believe that the government has engaged, or would engage, in this practice. However, I conclude that the statute does not permit such an unlimited grant of authority that would, by its terms, allow the initiation of surveillance in those circumstances. The motion is GRANTED only to the extent set out herein. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that, for purposes of the authority granted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805(0)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1805(c)(3) on pages 11 and 12 of the May 31 Order, NSA shall be deemed to obtain knowledge of the nature and location of a facility when NSA first is able to determine that there is probable cause to believe that the facility is being used or about to be used by a targeted foreign power. Such determination may be made on the basis, in whole or in part, of analysis of information acquired by NSA on or before May 24, 2007, so long as the analysis that first results in such probable cause assessment was completed after May 24, 2007. In his order in this docket entered on July 27, 2007, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton noted the pendency of this motion as a reason for not requiring supplementation of the report filed by the government on July 18, 2007, regarding compliance with this requirement. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that, by August 10, 2007, the government shall supplement that report by providing a statement whether, for each of the reported facilities, NSA was first able to determine that there was probable cause to believe that the facility was being used or about to be used by a targeted foreign power based on an analytical assessment NSA completed subsequent to May 24, 2007. In my view, an affirmative statement in this form should generally suffice to show that this requirement was satisfied. Similar supplementation may be sufficient with respect to the reports required by Judges Kazen, Bates, Benson, Scullin, and Kollar-Kotelly, see footnote 1 above, but I do not decide those issues now, Done and ordered this 2nd day of August, 2007, in Docket NO ROGER VINSON Judge, United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court TOP SECRETICOMINTHORCON,NOFORNIXI Page 4", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

That, they say, violates President Obama\u2019s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it.\nThe next sentence \u2014 \u201cMr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that.\u201d \u2014 clearly has many people fired up.\nA reader, Richard Limmer, was one of many who wrote to me about it. In an email he asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think a reasonable person would call that lying? Even the word \u2018misspoke\u2019 is Orwellian \u2018doublespeak\u2019 and part of the \u2018newspeak\u2019 your editors resort to when trying to rationalize Obama\u2019s blatant lies.\u201d\nAnother reader, Dean Landsman, saw this as a syntax problem: \u201cThere\u2019s a word flow and syntax problem here, or so it seems to me. How can one \u2018clearly misspeak?\u2019 Perhaps it would better flow, or would have been better stated, as, \u2018Clearly Mr. Obama misspoke when he said that.\u2019\u201d\nAnd a number of media outlets took the opportunity to bash The Times. The Fox News host Greta Van Susteren swung away on her blog: \u201cThe President said this not once, not twice, but multiple times and it was part of the Obamacare supporter talking points. You say it one time and it could be misspeaking \u2014 but when it is part of your mantra, and your talking points \u2026 repeated over and over and over again \u2026 well, the rest of us just are not that stupid.\u201d\nOn Monday, I asked the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, about the wording.\n\u201cWe have a high threshold for whether someone lied,\u201d he told me. The phrase that The Times used \u201cmeans that he said something that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d Saying the president lied would have meant something different, Mr. Rosenthal said \u2014 that he knew it was false and intended to express the falsehood. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.\nContrary to what many readers and commenters are saying, The Times has frequently been tough on the president and his administration in recent months on subjects from press rights to surveillance to drones.\nBut \u201cmisspoke\u201d does suggest a one-time slip of the tongue.\nWouldn\u2019t it have been better, I asked Mr. Rosenthal, if the editorial had said that Mr. Obama\u2019s statements \u201cclearly weren\u2019t true,\u201d or that the president \u201cwas clearly wrong\u201d when he repeatedly made those statements?\nHe responded that the editorial\u2019s language was fine, but he also allowed, \u201cWe could have done that.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The disadvantages: I\u2019d lose a familiar community and a host of friends, and his house, unlike mine, is on a steep hill with no nearby stores; if I could no longer drive, I\u2019d have to be chauffeured everywhere.\nProbably my biggest deterrent would be relinquishing my independence and the incredible number of \u201ctreasures\u201d I\u2019ve amassed over the last half century. The junk would be easy, but parting with the works of art and mementos would be like cutting out my heart.\nI suspect that most people are reluctant to think about changing where and how they live as long as they are managing well at the moment. Lisa Selin Davis reports in AARP magazine that \u201calmost 90 percent of Americans 65 or older plan to stay in their homes as they age.\u201d Yet for many, the design of their homes and communities does not suit older adults who lack the mobility, agility and swiftness of the young.\nFor those who wish to age in place, the authors of \u201c70Candles: Women Thriving in Their 8th Decade,\u201d Jane Giddan and Ellen Cole, list such often-needed home attributes as an absence of stairs, wide doorways to accommodate a walker or wheelchair, slip-resistant floors, lever-style door knobs, remotely controlled lighting, walk-in showers, railings, ramps and lifts. Add to these a 24-hour help system, mobile phone, surveillance cameras and GPS locaters that enable family members to monitor the well-being of their elders.\nIn many communities, volunteer organizations, like Good Neighbors of Park Slope in Brooklyn and Staying in Place in Woodstock, N.Y., help older residents remain in their homes and live easier and more fulfilling lives.\nWhile many young adults chose to live and bring up children in the suburbs, a growing number of empty-nested retirees are now moving to city centers where they can access public transportation, shop on foot for food and household needs, and enjoy cultural offerings and friendly gatherings without depending unduly on others.\nOne reason my friends and I are unwilling to even consider leaving our Brooklyn community is our ability to walk to supermarkets, banks, food co-ops, hardware stores, worship and recreational facilities, and get virtually everywhere in the city with low-cost and usually highly efficient public transportation. No driving necessary.\nWe also wallow in the joys of near-daily walks in a big, beautiful urban park, remarking each time about some lovely vista \u2014 the moon, sunrise, visible planets, new plantings and resident wildlife.\nThroughout the country, communities are being retrofitted to accommodate the tsunami of elders expected to live there as baby boomers age. Changes like altering traffic signals and street crossings to give pedestrians more time to cross enhance safety for people whose mobility is compromised. New York City, for example, has created Aging Improvement Districts, so far in East Harlem, the Upper West Side and Bedford-Stuyvesant, to help older people \u201clive as independently and engaged in the city as possible,\u201d Ms. Giddan and Ms. Cole wrote. In East Harlem, for example, merchants have made signs easier to read and provided folding chairs for seniors who wish to rest before and after shopping.\nIn Philadelphia, a nonprofit organization, Friends in the City, calls itself a \u201ccommunity without walls\u201d designed to bring members closer to the city\u2019s resources and to one another. It offers seniors a daily variety of programs to suit many cultural and recreational interests.\nAlso evolving is the concept of home sharing, in which several older people who did not necessarily know one another get together to buy a home in which to live and share responsibilities for shopping, cooking, cleaning and home repair. For example, in Oregon, Let\u2019s Share Housing, and in Vermont, Home Share Now, have online services that connect people with similar needs, Ms. Giddan and Ms. Cole report. There\u2019s also an online matching service \u2014 Roommates4Boomers.com \u2014 for women 50 and over looking for compatible living mates.\nOf course, there are still many older adults, widows and widowers in particular, who for financial or personal reasons move in with a grown child\u2019s family, sometimes in an attached apartment or separate floor. Host families may gain a built-in babysitter, and children can develop a more intimate relationship with grandma or grandpa.\nFor those with adequate finances, there is no shortage of for-profit retirement communities that help older people remain independent by providing supportive services and a host of amenities and activities. Some have extensive recreational and exercise facilities, as well as book and craft clubs, discussion groups and volunteer opportunities. Some take residents to theatrical productions and museums and on trips to nearby attractions.\nI confess that retirement communities that house only older adults are not my style. I can\u2019t imagine living in a place where I don\u2019t see and interact with children on a daily basis. I find that nothing cheers me more than a smile or comment from a toddler. I guess I take after my father, who used to flirt with every child he noticed in a car near his. But I realize that, just as some people are averse to dogs, not everyone enjoys the companionship of a high-energy child.\nFor older people likely to require help with the activities of daily living, there are many assisted living facilities where residents can get more or less help, including aid with medications, feeding and ambulation, according to their changing needs.\nAnd should I ever have to leave my home, Ms. Giddan and Ms. Cole point out that there is a new and growing cadre of professional organizers and moving managers to \u201chelp people sort through accumulated belongings,\ndistribute and disperse what won\u2019t be needed in the new setting, and assist with all stages of packing, moving and then unpacking, and staging the new home.\u201d\nThis is the second of two columns about adjustments to aging.

If a company is served with a lawful order to assist with an ongoing criminal investigation and it is possible for that company to assist, it has to comply. Apple was served a warrant. If it can comply, it has to service the warrant. If it can\u2019t comply, it can ask a judge to vacate the warrant.\nApple says it can\u2019t open the iPhone\u2019s encrypted passcode. If this is true, they are off the hook, but if they can build the technology to comply (or already have), they need do what the warrant asks.\nNobody is asking for backdoor entry into Americans' phones: That\u2019s a fiction invented to skew the debate. What the U.S. and many other countries are asking for is lawful access to communications when authorized by a court. This is the real encryption debate: What are the rules under which a government can open an encrypted iPhone or similar device, and access its messages in plaintext?\nIntelligence agencies in the U.S. and elsewhere can usually find a way to get access to plaintext, or unencrypted text, without cooperation from companies, but the data they get may not be introducible in court, at least in democracies.\nApple needs to make the case to its global market that they don\u2019t turn over data whenever the F.B.I. strolls through the door. That\u2019s understandable. The U.S. also needs to help tech companies reassure a global market about surveillance in order to reassure customers.\nBut there are plenty of instances when it's appropriate for encrypted products to be opened to law enforcement, and the investigation into the San Bernardino killers is a prime example.\nThe best case scenario for cooperation between tech companies and governments would be an international agreement that lets people secure their data with the strongest possible encryption, using products that allow for the lawful recovery of plaintext by their governing national authorities under agreed-upon rules. The precedent to build on is the system of mutual legal assistance treaties that allow countries to exchange evidence and information for crimes like money laundering.\nIf countries can agree on reciprocal rules on accessing plaintext, we can get out of the encryption mess. This may not please privacy zealots, but it would make the Internet more secure without putting lives at risk.\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But in truth, given the extraordinarily high incidence of ankle sprains, we\u2019d probably all be better off if we had thick stumps like an elephant\u2019s to connect our feet to our legs.\nEvery day in the United States, about 28,000 people sprain an ankle. Too often the injury is dismissed as \u201cjust a sprain,\u201d with no specific treatment and a return to full activity before it has completely healed. Fully 45 percent of all athletic injuries are ankle sprains, and players often go back into the game with little or no treatment as soon as the pain subsides.\nIn fact, according to the International Ankle Consortium, a global group of researchers and clinicians who study ankle injuries, 55 percent of people who sprain an ankle never seek professional treatment in the aftermath of the injury.\nYet the majority of ankle sprains are doomed to recur. That\u2019s because they often result in a chronically unstable joint that tends to \u201cgive way,\u201d poor balance, a distorted gait, difficulty exercising, weight gain, diminished quality of life and early arthritis. Not to mention the expense of dealing with health problems that can result from being overweight and sedentary living.\nSound scary? It should, says Phillip A. Gribble, an athletic trainer at the University of Kentucky and co-director of the International Ankle Consortium, who hopes that knowing the potential consequences of ankle injuries will prompt more people to treat them with respect and seek proper treatment. Even better, he said, would be if more people took steps to prevent injury in the first place. And that, ladies, may include leaving those spike heels in the store.\nDr. Gribble was one of several experts who recently presented the latest technical information on ankle sprains to the National Athletic Trainers\u2019 Association meeting in Baltimore. In a study of 3,526 adults who responded to a questionnaire, more than half, or 1,843, had previously sustained an ankle injury. Those who had injured their ankles tended to weigh more, had greater limitations in their daily activities and were more likely to have cardiovascular or respiratory conditions than those who remained injury free.\nWhile ankle sprains are most common among physically active people, especially amateur and professional sports players and dancers, the general public is hardly immune. The injury can result from walking on an uneven surface (especially while wearing high heels or platform shoes), misstepping off a curb or staircase, being pulled erratically by a dog on a leash, even playing around in the yard with children or friends.\nIt doesn\u2019t take much. I know \u2014 years ago, I sustained two bad sprains, one stepping on a stick while trimming a hedge and the other missing the last step while exiting a plane in the dark. I am now extremely careful about where I walk and what I put on my feet, especially when hiking in the woods (boots are de rigueur).\nMost ankle sprains result when the foot abruptly turns in under the leg so that the sole of that foot faces the opposite leg, unduly stretching the ligament on the outside of the ankle. The extent of the injury can range from a minor strain to a complete tear, and the rate and extent of healing can vary greatly.\nIn one report to the athletic trainers\u2019 convention, 12 college students who had sprained an ankle still had an incompletely healed, overstretched ligament a year after the injury, which \u201cmay explain the high percentage of patients that develop chronic ankle instability,\u201d said Tricia Hubbard-Turner of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.\nEven though fewer than half of ankle sprains receive medical attention, the injury is so common that it is the leading lower extremity injury that results in an emergency room visit (an estimated incidence of 2.06 ankle sprains per 1,000 people a year), according to data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System.\nAs with any injury, ankle sprains are best prevented. One of the best approaches is to improve one\u2019s balance with exercises that train the body to stay upright and maintain control in all kinds of positions. Dr. Gribble recommends spending time standing on one foot, at first on a firm surface, then with eyes closed, then on a soft surface like a pillow. As a final challenge, practice balancing on a wobble board, he said.\nMuscles surrounding the ankle can be strengthened by wrapping a towel around the foot for resistance, then moving the foot up, down, in and out. Do stretching exercises that increase the flexibility of the legs, hip and torso to guard against any unanticipated awkward movements.\nWhen participating in sports like basketball, soccer and tennis \u2014 which involve jumps or quick changes in direction that can put ankles at risk \u2014 consider taping or bracing the ankles to increase their stability.\nFinally, avoid being a weekend warrior who indulges in a sport full tilt without adequate preparation. Build up gradually, practice the skills involved and make sure to keep needed muscles strong.\nShould you sprain an ankle, avoid the all too common layman\u2019s advice to \u201cwalk it off.\u201d At a minimum, leave the game or whatever you were doing and avoid putting weight on that foot to give the injured joint adequate rest. If the injury is severe, you may need to use crutches.\nIf you do sprain an ankle, apply ice wrapped in a cloth for 15 to 20 minutes every two or three hours for two days, then once a day until pain and swelling are gone. Sit or lie down as much as possible with the injured ankle elevated above the hip. To further minimize swelling, wrap the ankle in an elastic bandage, starting at the toes and working up to the leg.\nSeriously consider a medical consultation, especially if pain and swelling persist for more than a few days. Although in most cases, an X-ray or M.R.I. is not needed to make an accurate diagnosis, the injury could be more serious than a simple sprain. Ask about physical therapy, which can strengthen the joint and help prevent reinjury.\nMost important of all, don\u2019t rush back into activity before healing is complete and normal, pain-free range of motion has been restored. Reinjuring the ankle can result in permanent pain and disability and the health consequences noted above.\nRelated:\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

ISIS (or ISIL as the White House and others refer to the group), the president said, \u201cis a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.\u201d The man picked to manage Obama\u2019s strategy, General John R. Allen, wrote in the publication Defense One that \u201cthe Islamic State is an entity beyond the pale of humanity and it must be eradicated.\u201d\nThe powerful rhetoric centered on the word \u201cterrorism\u201d makes it difficult to speak intelligently about its real sources.\nIt is undeniable that many of the tactics being used by ISIS \u2014 executions of civilians and well publicized beheadings of hostages \u2014 do violate accepted standards of conduct in conflict (detailed in an evolving legal and philosophical code known as just war theory.) And understandably, those moved by language of the sort used by the president and his staff are in no mood to consider softer tactics like negotiation with ISIS, nor to ponder the complex causes contributing to its rise. Obama\u2019s stated policy of removing the \u201ccancer\u201d threatening the established political order in the Middle East is already underway, and is facing little resistance.\nThis is merely the latest example of a powerful rhetoric centered on the word \u201cterrorism\u201d that has shaped \u2014 and continues to shape \u2014 popular conceptions about contemporary political conflicts, making it difficult to speak intelligently about their real sources.\nIf individuals and groups are portrayed as irrational, barbaric, and beyond the pale of negotiation and compromise, as this rhetoric would have it, then asking why they resort to terrorism is viewed as pointless, needlessly accommodating, or, at best, mere pathological curiosity. Those normally inclined to ask \u201cWhy?\u201d are in danger of being labeled \u201csoft\u201d on terrorism, while the more militant use the \u201cterrorist\u201d label to blur the distinction between critical examination and appeasement.\n*\nPart of the success of this rhetoric traces to the fact that there is no consensus about the meaning of \u201cterrorism.\u201d While it is typically understood to mean politically motivated violence directed against civilians, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Defense, for example, describe terrorism as the unlawful use of violence to achieve political goals by coercing governments or societies. The State Department cites a legal definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d as \u201cpremeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by sub-national groups or clandestine agents.\u201d It adds: \u201cThe term \u2018noncombatant\u2019 is interpreted to include, in addition to civilians, military personnel who at the time of the incident are unarmed or not on duty.\u201d Thus, by means of linguistic gerrymander, members of uniformed government military forces acting under government authorization are incapable of committing acts of terrorism no matter how many civilians are ground up in the process.\nWhen violent political groups like ISIS are labeled as irrational and barbaric, asking why they resort to terrorism becomes pointless.\nEven when a definition is agreed upon, the rhetoric of \u201cterror\u201d is applied both selectively and inconsistently. In the mainstream American media, the \u201cterrorist\u201d label is usually reserved for those opposed to the policies of the U.S. and its allies. By contrast, some acts of violence that constitute terrorism under most definitions are not identified as such \u2014 for instance, the massacre of over 2000 Palestinian civilians in the Beirut refugee camps in 1982 or the killings of more than 3000 civilians in Nicaragua by \u201ccontra\u201d rebels during the 1980s, or the genocide that took the lives of at least a half million Rwandans in 1994. At the opposite end of the spectrum, some actions that do not qualify as terrorism are labeled as such \u2014 that would include attacks by Hamas, Hezbollah or ISIS, for instance, against uniformed soldiers on duty.\nHistorically, the rhetoric of terror has been used by those in power not only to sway public opinion, but to direct attention away from their own acts of terror. Yet, to the fair-minded, the attempt by governments to justify bombardment of residential districts, schools and hospitals in the name of fighting terrorism is outright hypocrisy. Government forces have long provided outstanding examples of politically-motivated violence against civilians, the very thing they allegedly oppose. Claims about not \u201ctargeting\u201d civilians ring hollow when it is quite obvious that high-tech explosives are aimed at buildings known to contain civilians.\nIf what is insidious about terrorism is its callous disregard for civilian lives in pursuit of political goals, why is there not an uproar about state terrorism? Why do so many reserve their venom for people whose destructive capacity pales in comparison with those who command tanks, artillery and warplanes?\nIt is easy to lose sight of inconsistencies in wartime hostilities. Instead, the emotional impact of language tends to triumph at the expense of accuracy and fairness. By effectively placing designated individuals or groups outside the norms of acceptable social and political behavior, the rhetoric of \u201cterror\u201d has had these effects:\n1) It erases any incentive the public might have to understand the nature and origins of their grievances so that the possible legitimacy of their demands will not be raised.\n2) It deflects attention away from one\u2019s own policies that might have contributed to their grievances.\n3) It repudiates any calls for negotiation.\n4) It obliterates the distinction between national liberation movements and fringe fanatics (for example, during the 1990s, the \u201cterrorist\u201d label was applied to Nelson Mandela and Timothy McVeigh alike);\n5) It paves the way for the use of force by making it easier for a government to exploit the fears of its citizens and ignore objections to the manner in which it responds to terrorist violence.\nThis is not just a strategy of the United States government. For decades, Israeli leaders have used such language in their attempt to discredit Palestinian nationalism and deflect attention away from their own policies in the occupied territories. In the 1986 book \u201cTerrorism: How the West Can Win,\u201d Benjamin Netanyahu, the book\u2019s editor, who is now Israel\u2019s prime minister, encouraged pre-emptive strikes \u201cto weaken and destroy the terrorist\u2019s ability to consistently launch attacks,\u201d even at the \u201crisk of civilian casualties.\u201d Addressing the origins of terrorism, he surmised that \u201cthe root cause of terrorism lies not in grievances but in a disposition toward unbridled violence\u201d traceable to \u201ca worldview that asserts that certain ideological and religious goals justify, indeed demand, the shedding of all moral inhibitions.\u201d Other contributors to the volume voiced similar sentiments in portraying the terrorist as a carrier of \u201coppression and enslavement,\u201d having \u201cno moral sense,\u201d \u201ca perfect nihilist,\u201d and whose elimination is the only rational means for the West to \u201cwin.\u201d\nRelated\nMore From The Stone\nRead previous contributions to this series.\nMore careful assessments were made by scholars like Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, who has stressed that foreign military interventions and nationalism are the primary causes of terrorist violence. In his book \u201cDying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism,\u201d Pape argued that desires for national self-determination and an end to military occupation were at the root of nearly every instance of suicide terrorism from 1980 to 2003, and that while religion was used a tool for recruiting and procuring aid from abroad, it was rarely the cause. While some took issue with Pape\u2019s analysis, he at least employed a more dispassionate, analytical approach in attempting to understand this form of violence.\n*\nObviously, to point out the causes and objectives of particular terrorist actions is to imply nothing about their legitimacy \u2014 that is an independent matter \u2014 nor is it any endorsement of a particular method for dealing with the problem of terrorist violence. Yet, to ignore these causes and objectives is to undermine attempts to deal intelligently with terrorism, since it leaves untouched its motivating factors, and paves the way for blind reactions of the sort that are likely to exacerbate rather than resolve the problem.\nTo put it bluntly, by stifling inquiry into causes, the rhetoric of \u201cterror\u201d actually increases the likelihood of terrorism. First, it magnifies the effect of terrorist actions by heightening the fear among the target population. If we demonize the terrorists, if we portray them as evil, irrational beings devoid of a moral sense, we amplify the fear and alarm generated by terrorist incidents, even when this is one of the political objectives of the perpetrators. In addition, stricter security measures often appear on the home front, including enhanced surveillance and an increasing militarization of local police.\nSecond, those who succumb to the rhetoric contribute to the cycle of revenge and retaliation by endorsing military actions that grievously harm the populations among whom terrorists live. The consequence is that civilians, those least protected, become the principle victims of \u201cretaliation\u201d or \u201ccounterterrorism.\u201d\nHaving been desensitized by language, the willingness to risk civilian casualties becomes increasingly widespread. For example, according to a CBS/New York Times poll of 1216 Americans published on September 16, 2001, nearly 60 percent of those polled supported the use of military force against terrorists even if \u201cmany thousands of innocent civilians may be killed,\u201d an echo of the view taken by Netanyahu in his book.\nThird, a violent response is likely to stiffen the resolve of those from whose ranks terrorists have emerged, leading them to regard their foes as people who cannot be reasoned with, as people who, because they avail themselves so readily of the rhetoric of \u201cterror,\u201d know only the language of force. As long as groups perceive themselves to be victims of intolerable injustices and view their oppressors as unwilling to arrive at an acceptable compromise, they are likely to answer violence with more violence. Their reaction might be strategic, if directed against civilians to achieve a particular political objective, but, with the oppression unabated, it increasingly becomes the retaliatory violence of despair and revenge.\nIn \u201c1984,\u201d George Orwell described doublethink as \u201cthe power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them,\u201d and portrayed it as a device for destroying the capacity for critical thinking, for controlling populations, and for perpetuating the political status quo. Something like doublethink is occurring as the rhetoric of terror continues to immerse us in a nightmare of skewed reason and perpetual warfare. In condemning terrorism, we think of it as something to be eliminated at all costs. Yet, in sanctioning the use of modern weaponry to achieve this end, regardless of its impact upon civilian populations, we are effectively advocating the very thing we condemn, and this is closer to doublethink than we should ever wish to be.\nTomis Kapitan is a professor emeritus at Northern Illinois University.

This has prompted a debate over civil liberties.\nHere is a breakdown of the proposed changes and how they compare with the policies in place in other countries.\n-\nCITIZENSHIPNo government proposal since the terrorist attacks in November has raised as much alarm among civil libertarians as one that would strip French citizenship from people with dual citizenship who have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes.\n-\nFrance\nThe French government had proposed a measure that would strip citizenship from French-born dual citizens convicted of terrorism.\nOn March 30, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced he was withdrawing the proposal.\nPolls had suggested that there was wide public support, but opponents said the proposal unfairly targeted French people with immigrant backgrounds.\nThe measure highlighted a growing split among Mr. Hollande\u2019s Socialist Party between those who favored a tough law-and-order approach in the wake of the attacks in November that killed 130 people, and those worried that the government would be impinging on civil liberties.\n-\nElsewhere\nIn Britain, the government has used its power to revoke citizenship to keep terrorism suspects from re-entering the country.\nThe protections of citizenship are arguably more valuable in the European Union than they are elsewhere in the world. In European countries, foreigners are sometimes afforded greater consideration from prosecutors than citizens are.\nIn Egypt, foreigners \u2014 especially Westerners \u2014 are often deported rather than imprisoned. And in China, foreigners who are detained can sometimes receive stronger protections, because their governments can demand consular access.\nIn Iran, dual citizens are, for the purposes of prosecution, considered Iranian and have been caught in particularly complex legal and diplomatic situations.\n-\nEMERGENCY POWERSUnder the current law, the president can declare a 12-day state of emergency, which Parliament can extend.\n-\nFrance\nThe National Assembly voted Tuesday to extend the current state of emergency for another three months, until May 26.\nIt has been in place since Nov. 14 \u2013 the day after Paris was struck by terrorist attacks \u2013 enabling French authorities to conduct police raids without warrants and put suspects under house arrest without prior judicial authorization. They can also ban public demonstrations, shut down websites and disband groups deemed a threat to public order by the government.\nThe government is pushing to make the power to declare a state of emergency part of the French Constitution, which would make it more difficult for successive governments to change how that power is wielded.\nThe state of emergency has received broad approval in France, where recent polls show that more than two-thirds of the public support it.\nHuman rights groups have protested, and some Muslims believe that they are being unfairly singled out by the expanded police measures.\n-\nElsewhere\nMost governments have some legal mechanism for declaring an emergency in the event of war, insurrection or natural disaster. But many countries have laws that restrict the movement of citizens even in the absence of an emergency.\nTurkey used a state of emergency to quell an insurgency by Kurdish groups in the southeastern part of the country, and Egypt maintains a state of emergency in the northern parts of the Sinai Peninsula, where security forces have been battling Islamic militants.\nIn China, martial law is rarely declared because the government already holds broad powers to detain, control or restrict the movement of people. The national legislature passed a counterterrorism law and a national security law in 2015 authorizing restrictions in response to a terrorist attack or major threat.\n-\n-\nPOLICE AUTHORITYProvisions would allow for detentions, searches and the expanded use of deadly force by the police.\n-\nFrance\nThe police can detain terrorism suspects for up to 144 hours without charges. The government is seeking new powers, including the ability to hold someone for up to four hours to check his identification and the authority to search bags and vehicles near \u201csensitive\u201d sites by order of a prosecutor.\nThe proposed law would also allow the government to put someone returning from a \u201cterrorist theater of operation,\u201d like Syria or Iraq, under house arrest for up to a month.\nThe bill has already riled some judges and human rights groups, which say the government is trying to institutionalize exceptional measures after the state of emergency ends.\n-\nElsewhere\nThere are legal provisions in many countries for the police to arrest and hold suspects without charge for a limited time.\nIn Russia, the police may hold a suspect for 48 hours before a court must issue formal charges, lest the suspect go free.\nIn China, the police can detain citizens for up to 30 days with the approval of a prosecutor\u2019s office before making a formal arrest. House arrest can last six months, and can easily be extended.\nIn Israel, the authorities can hold suspects in administrative detention without charges or a trial, and typically withhold evidence from the accused and their lawyers. Suspects are often held for renewable periods of six months, which can sometimes stretch into years.\n-\nSURVEILLANCEIntelligence agencies were given new powers to monitor communications after terrorist attacks in January 2015. Now, police agencies and prosecutors are seeking similar investigative powers.\n-\nFrance\nA provision in the policing bill would let prosecutors eavesdrop on cellphone communications with a judge\u2019s authorization, using technology currently available only to intelligence agencies, which were granted enhanced capabilities after the attacks in January 2015 at the Paris offices of a satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, and a kosher supermarket.\nThe new bill would also give prosecutors powers similar to those of investigative judges, including the ability to tap phones, use hidden cameras and analyze electronic communications.\nCritics worry that these surveillance powers go well beyond fighting terrorism, and that extraordinary measures undertaken during the state of emergency are slipping into common practice.\n-\nElsewhere\nIn the United States, the National Security Agency has carried out complex electronic surveillance domestically and abroad since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The agency\u2019s monitoring of international calls and emails without warrants, and its secret collection of metadata, have raised serious privacy concerns.\nIn 2007, President George W. Bush signed a law broadly expanding the government\u2019s authority to eavesdrop on international calls and email without warrants.\nWhen it was revealed in 2013 by Edward J. Snowden, a former government contractor, that the N.S.A. had been secretly collecting and storing Americans\u2019 phone records, the government again reviewed its surveillance practices.In 2015, President Obama signed a law that allowed the government to conduct surveillance operations,\nbut with new limits.\n-", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The news comes shortly after the central government declared its intention to abolish the labor-camp system \u2013 known in Chinese as laojiao \u2013 news that came in the report of the Third Plenum, the leadership meeting that wrapped up on Nov. 12.\nAn unidentified high-level official in the Beijing re-education through labor office was quoted in the Quanzhou Evening News as saying that a formal plan to abolish the program probably would not come until 2014.\nA United Nations Human Rights Council report from 2009 estimated that 190,000 people were being held in about 300 labor camps across China, but it has historically been very difficult to obtain accurate information\non the program. In an interview with Southern Weekend, a popular and relatively independent newspaper in Guangdong Province, Wang Gongyi, the director of the Justice\nMinistry\u2019s research institute, put the number at more than 220,000.\n\u201cAt present, the majority of the people in labor camps are there for drug abuses,\u201d Mr. Wang was quoted as saying by Southern Weekend on Sunday. \u201cApproximately 200,000 are there for drug-related crimes while other offenses only account for 20,000 to 30,000 people.\u201d\nMr. Wang said there was considerable overlap between laojiao centers and drug rehabilitation centers, raising the possibility that the two programs will undergo some form of consolidation.\nAn online inquiry made by reporters at Southern Daily revealed that at least four provincial re-education through labor websites had already added \u201cdrug rehabilitation\u201d subheadings in parenthesis after any mention of \u201cre-education through labor\u201d on their sites. Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that at least one former labor camp in Yunnan, a province with a relatively high rate of illegal substance abuse, will be converted into a drug rehabilitation center.\nThe re-education through labor system was first adopted in 1957 to punish minor offenders and relieve some of the pressure on the court system. But in the late 1950s, laojiao was widely used to combat \u201ccounterrevolutionary elements\u201d within the Communist Party, setting a precedent for its later use as a tool for cracking down on political dissenters and other perceived agitators.\nThe system, which is jointly run by the public security, civil affairs and education departments, allows the police to send people to labor camps for up to four years without a trial. Under China\u2019s current criminal law, the lightest penalty is three months to two years of house arrest under surveillance, while the second lightest penalty is one to six months in police detention.\n\u201cThe laojiao program can be harsher than a penalty imposed by a court,\u201d Chen Weidong, a professor of criminal procedural law at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Renmin University, told Xinhua News. \u201cThat\u2019s why some minor offenders would rather be prosecuted\u201d than undergo re-education, he said.\nWhile news of the termination of laojiao has been met with widespread public support, many experts worry that the abolition of the system will lead to an increase in other forms of extralegal detainment, such as so-called black jails, or illegal prisons, and forcible detainment at psychiatric prisons without patient consent.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the Chinese Lawyers for the Protection of Human Rights vowed to vigilantly monitor the government\u2019s abolition of the re-education program. Among the six recommendations by the group were for the government to \u201cimmediately outlaw and close down extra-legal detention facilities,\u201d including the so-called legal education centers, disciplinary sites and black jails. It also urged legal accountability of officials who illegally operated these facilities.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Participants in the X Games and other sporting events regularly perform heart-stopping tricks on skis and snowboards, skateboards and mountain bikes, all of them endlessly replayed on YouTube and television for a growing audience of thrill-seekers.\nUnfortunately, many young people eager for an adrenaline rush are trying to copy their extreme sports idols, putting themselves at terrible risk. Filled with overconfidence, many participants lack the skills and training for these stunts. And often they fail to use safety equipment that could reduce the risk of serious injury. Amateurs without referees, coaches or medical personnel around can end up with broken bones, crushed skulls, severe concussions, ruptured blood vessels or lifelong disability \u2014 if they survive.\nMore than four million injuries attributed to extreme sports occurred from 2000 through 2011, according to data collected by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. In the first-ever study of the nature of these injuries, Dr. Vani J. Sabesan, an orthopedic surgeon at Western Michigan University School of Medicine, and her colleagues examined the incidence of head and neck injuries, the most serious hazards short of death.\nAt the recent annual meeting of the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, Dr. Sabesan reported that more than 40,000 such injuries occur annually among participants in seven extreme sports, including skateboarding, snowboarding, mountain biking and motocross. Her analysis showed that 83 percent were head injuries and 17 percent neck injuries, with 2.5 percent described as severe, resulting in potential lifelong disability or death.\n\u201cThe level of competition and injuries we\u2019re seeing keep rising,\u201d Dr. Sabesan said in an interview. \u201cMany do recover, but not necessarily without long-term consequences.\u201d\nDr. Sabesan noted that head and neck injuries were of particular concern because of the \u201cincreased awareness of their short- and long-term consequences: concussions, fractures and traumatic brain injuries, which can result in outcomes such as chronic depression, headaches, paralysis and death.\u201d\nSkateboarding caused the most head and neck injuries: more than 129,000 reported during the study\u2019s 12 years. Snowboarding produced more than 97,000 such injuries, while skiers experienced more than 83,000, and motocross participants more than 78,000.\nDr. Sabesan said that not only were more people engaged in extreme sports each year, but also that the participants were younger. \u201cWith very young kids tearing down ski slopes at 60 miles an hour, the risk of suffering a life-changing injury is all too real,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYoung people often lack judgment,\u201d she added. \u201cThey see snowboarder Shaun White take the sport to a whole new level, and some kids try to emulate his tricks. In effect, the culture says it\u2019s O.K. to try this.\u201d\nAccording to Dr. Sabesan, skateboarding is particularly hazardous because helmets, now routine for skiers, are not required. Yet, she said, \u201cwhen you land on your head on concrete or asphalt, it\u2019s not as forgiving as snow.\u201d The study found the risk of suffering a skull fracture while skateboarding was 54 times that of doing so while snowboarding.\nHer first recommendation to reduce the risk of serious injury is to use proper safety equipment. \u201cA simple thing like wearing a helmet can go a long way toward preventing a lifelong disability,\u201d she said.\nHer own experience underscores this advice. While training for a triathlon, she flipped over the handlebars of her bike and landed on her head. A helmet protected her brain.\nMy 23-year-old nephew, Sam, was spared permanent disability by the protective garments he wore during a terrifying fall while biking on a mountain trail two summers ago.\nComing very fast downhill into a blind turn, he said, he was able to hop over two logs across the trail, but his front wheel caught the third log and he was catapulted over the handlebars. He landed on his head hard enough to split his helmet. He was knocked unconscious and badly banged up, but no bones were broken and his brain recovered fully.\n\u201cI was wearing a full-mask helmet and a full upper-body suit of armor called a pressure suit, as well as knee and shin guards,\u201d he said. The suit and guards protected a shoulder and knee that also landed hard, he said, but \u201cif I hadn\u2019t been wearing that helmet, I probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nEven after sustaining serious injuries, extreme sports participants often come back for more. Dr. Sabesan said she recently treated a 28-year-old woman for a broken arm and two fractured femurs suffered while she attempted a jump at an all-terrain-vehicle racetrack in Michigan. The woman, who works as a bank manager, had previously suffered a broken neck and ribs in a similar accident.\n\u201cThe occurrence of serious injuries is definitely increasing as participation rates in extreme sports go up,\u201d Dr. Sabesan said. Yet, she added, adequate studies of the associated risks have not been done.\n\u201cWe have no baseline,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one is monitoring injuries that occur during the X Games. There\u2019s minimal literature on hip and knee dislocations, broken bones or the long-term effects of head and other injuries.\u201d\nDr. Sabesan said her findings pointed to the need for trained supervision and medical assistance at extreme sports events, as well as proper training of participants and mandated safety equipment.\nHer message to parents: Require children who skateboard to wear a helmet and elbow and wrist guards. Snowboarders, whose feet are strapped to the board, should wear wrist guards to protect them if they fall on outstretched hands. And, of course, everyone on a bike, skis or a board should wear a helmet designed for the activity.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The employee, Christopher Tarui, an adviser to large institutional investors in Bridgewater, said that his supervisor sexually harassed him and, when he complained, managers pressured him to rescind his claims. Mr. Tarui also described an atmosphere of constant surveillance by video and security guards to silence employees that do not fit the Bridgewater mold.\nMr. Tarui\u2019s assertions were echoed in interviews with seven other people who had worked with or for the company.

The bank said it made a profit of 20 million euros, or about $22 million, in the quarter, compared with the \u20ac818 million profit it made for the same period in 2015. The bank blamed the uncertainty caused by Britain\u2019s referendum on its membership of the European Union for the drop in revenue.\nDeutsche has been trying to defend its status as one of the last credible European challengers to big American investment banks.

President Dilma Rousseff has been suspended and faces an impeachment trial for financial improprieties. Numerous other top officials face investigations.\nTo compound the turmoil, health officials have raised concerns about the Zika virus, which has been linked to brain damage in babies and a form of temporary paralysis.\nAnd the Summer Olympics, a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Brazil to put its best foot forward on the world stage, open on Aug. 5.\nIt is not the first time the Games have come to a country in time of crisis.\n-\n2014 Sochi\nThe Winter Games in Sochi in the Caucasus Mountains were essentially on the cusp of a war zone.\nThere were violent insurgencies in Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, all within a stone\u2019s throw of Sochi. Some rebel leaders made direct threats on the Games.\nIn response, Russia put in place sweeping security measures, including tens of thousands of police and soldiers, surveillance cameras and antiaircraft batteries. Scores of protesters were detained ahead of the Games.\nShortly after the Games ended, Russia plunged into more controversial waters with a military intervention in Ukraine, and the eventual occupation and reclaiming of the Crimean Peninsula, drawing international condemnation.\n-\n1988 Seoul\nA year before the Games, nationwide protests erupted against the authoritarian government, demanding greater democracy to go along with South Korea\u2019s booming economy.\nThe protests were largely successful, leading to reforms like direct presidential elections. Some Olympics officials took partial credit for the changes, saying that the coming Games had helped prompt them. When the Games were awarded to Beijing for 2008, some even declared they expected democratic reform to follow there as well. Those predictions proved unfounded.\n-\n1968 Mexico City\nTen days before the Games, soldiers fired machine guns on thousands of student pro-democracy demonstrators in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, were killed; the numbers remain in dispute. Troops then hosed down the area, to erase traces of the massacre. The killings were followed by a crackdown on the democracy movement on the eve of the Games.\nThe Olympics proceeded despite the shootings. One of the most memorable moments came when two American sprinters, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, raised their fists on the medal stand in protest of racial politics at home. Although the massacre had not moved Olympics officials to act, Smith and Carlos were promptly kicked out of the Games.\n-\n1948 London/1920 Antwerp\nLondon was reeling from the aftermath of World War II when it hosted the Games. Basic goods were rationed, and there were still many areas that had not been rebuilt after bombing.\nThe Games were produced on the cheap, and no new venues were built. Male athletes stayed in former air force camps, while women were put up in college dorms. Several visiting nations contributed food and equipment. Clothing rationing meant that some athletes sewed their own uniforms.\nThe extreme austerity meant the Games actually made a small profit.\nAntwerp, awarded the Games in part because of the suffering of Belgium during the First World War, had similar issues in 1920. Athletes slept on cots, and the track stadium was unfinished.\n-\n-\n1940 Sapporo, Tokyo, Helsinki\nAsia was to have its first turn hosting the Olympics in 1940, and Sapporo and Tokyo were chosen as the sites for the Winter and Summer Games. Japan\u2019s invasion of China caused the events to be scuttled, and Helsinki was hastily chosen to replace Tokyo. Then the Soviet Union invaded Finland. The 1940 Games, as well as prospective Games in 1944, were canceled because of World War II.\nAll three cities eventually got their chance to host: Helsinki in 1952, Tokyo in 1964 (and again in 2020) and Sapporo in 1972.\n-\n1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Berlin\nGermany was selected to host the Winter and Summer Games in 1931. Two years later, Hitler became chancellor, and the Games took on a sinister hue.\nThere were a few small boycotts, but for the most part, the world came to Germany. Runners, jumpers and throwers from a number of nations gave the Nazi salute at the opening ceremony and on the winner\u2019s podium, and Hitler was on hand in a place of honor at many events. Germany excluded nearly every Jewish athlete from its teams.\nThe Berlin Games paved the way for many of the modern elements of the Games. They included the first torch relay, and they were the first to broadcast on television. The whole thing was filmed by the Nazi propagandist Leni Riefenstahl.\n-\n1932 Lake Placid, Los Angeles\nThe United States, like much of the world, was enduring the Depression when it hosted both Games in 1932. Godfrey Dewey, head of the Lake Placid organizing committee, donated family land for the bobsled run. Turnout was low at the Los Angeles Games, but money-saving measures allowed it to turn a profit.\nPerhaps of more concern to some athletes was Prohibition. French athletes demanded that wine be available to them at the Games. At one point, plans were made to substitute sugar syrup imported from Cuba. In the end, despite some tough talk, officials mostly looked the other way, and European athletes just may have managed a drink or two.\n-\n-\n1906 Athens\nThese Games, considered unofficial by some historians but billed as the Olympics at the time, heralded more than a century of sport-politics collisions at the Games.\nIn \u201cThe Complete Book of the Olympics,\u201d David Wallechinsky described the event: \u201cBritish and American tourists were shocked when a riot broke out in front of their hotel.

The target was Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy living in Britain. He\u2019s filmed here in a local shop, days before he was targeted. He and his daughter Yulia fell seriously ill from exposure to Novichok, but survived. Security footage allowed police to track the two suspected hit men as they entered Britain and scoped out their target over two days. March 2: They fly from Moscow to London\u2019s Gatwick Airport. They check into a hotel in East London. March 3: They take public transport to Salisbury where Mr. Skripal lived. They stake out their target for several hours. March 4: They return to Salisbury by train. Minutes later, a camera films them walking past this gas station just a short walk to Mr. Skripal\u2019s home. This was moments before their attack, police say. They\u2019re transporting the nerve agent in a perfume bottle. It\u2019s then sprayed on the front door handle of Mr. Skripal\u2019s house. Soon after, the men are seen returning to Salisbury train station. They\u2019re last seen that evening at Heathrow Airport. At 10:30 p.m. they leave London for Moscow. By then, Mr. Skripal and his daughter had been found unresponsive on a park bench. They were hospitalized and eventually recovered. Months later, two Salisbury residents found the discarded perfume bottle and were also hospitalized. Dawn Sturgess died from exposure and her partner, Charlie Rowley, became seriously ill. Police believe the two hit men traveled under aliases and have asked Russia for help identifying them.\nHow Surveillance Cameras Tracked Two Russian Hit Men\nBritish investigators used security footage and flight records to track two Russian men who now stand accused of attempted murder in the March attack featuring the nerve agent Novichok.\n3:32\n\u2018Everyone Died\u2019: How Gunmen Killed Dozens In Sderot\n28:50\nCaught on Camera, Traced by Phone: The Russian Military Unit That Killed Dozens in Bucha\n15:43\nInside the Final Days of the Doctor China Tried to Silence\n15:43\n\u89c6\u89c9\u8c03\u67e5\uff1a\u674e\u6587\u4eae\u533b\u751f\u7684\u6700\u540e\u65f6\u523b\n14:26\nChina\u2019s Surveillance State Is Growing.

The system is called Aadhaar: the Hindi word for \u201cfoundation.\u201d All public services, and many private ones, depend on a person proving their identity through a scan of their finger, eye and face.

The idea is to modernize services in a country with millions of illiterate and poor people. The government also wants to clamp down on corruption and the black market. Critics raise many red flags, saying the ID system violates Indians\u2019 privacy rights and could lead to a surveillance state. There\u2019s also the question of data security. The government admits that sensitive personal information has been leaked more than 200 times. There are practical issues, too. Can you even get proper biometric data from someone who\u2019s spent a lifetime working with their hands, and who may not even have clear fingerprints to scan?

With her long dark hair in a ponytail and her black-and-red scarf loose around her neck, she is plummeting from a fourth-floor balcony, through the neon-charged November night.\nBelow awaits 40th Road, a gritty street of commerce in the Flushing section of Queens. Chinese restaurants and narrow storefronts, and dim stairwells leading to private transactions. Strivers and dawdlers and passers-by, all oblivious to what is transpiring above.\nBut before the pavement ends the woman\u2019s descent, a few feet from a restaurant\u2019s glittering Christmas tree, imagine her fall suddenly suspended \u2014 her body freeze-framed in midair. If only for a moment.\nShe toils in the netherworld of Flushing massage parlors, where she goes by the street name of SiSi. A youthful 38, she is in a platonic marriage to a man more than twice her age; harbors fading hopes of American citizenship; and is fond of Heineken, Red Bull and the rotisserie chicken at a Colombian place on Kissena Boulevard. Among her competitors, she is considered territorial and tireless.\nIt is the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and SiSi is in a shabby building\u2019s top-floor apartment, for which she pays her \u201cboss\u201d a hefty fee. She has returned from a market with provisions. She has tried calling her younger brother in China, but he is asleep. She has been on the phone with friends and clients, unaware that she is in the sights of a 10-member police team working vice.\nShe heads downstairs to stand at her building\u2019s entrance, a necessity of her job. Soon she is leading a man back upstairs \u2014 an officer working undercover \u2014 as her closely held cellphone casts a glow about her face. Their awkward conversation in her apartment convinces him that SiSi has broken the law, just as it convinces SiSi that he is a cop. She pushes him out and closes the door, though not to the inevitable. She knows from experience what comes next:\nMore police. Tromping through the dusky vestibule of her building, across the worn scarlet rug and up the 50 tiled steps. Past the Chinese sign that says if you\u2019re looking for the driving school, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Then right to her door.\nThe handcuffs. The hurried escort to a police vehicle. The humiliation. Again.\nSiSi watches the officers ascend on the video monitor she keeps near the door. Under the fixed gaze of one of those lucky cat figurines perched on a table, its paw raised in a wish of good fortune, she begins to pace.\nNow they are pounding on the door and shouting Police! Open up! SiSi rushes to the apartment\u2019s north balcony, with its panoramic view of the street hustle below. Day and night, sun or sleet, this is where she and her sister competitors sing their plaintive song to passing men: Massage? Massage?\nOn the narrow balcony, barely two feet deep, she keeps a broom, a bucket and a small blue stool. Up she steps \u2014 and now she is falling, plunging toward the hard tenth of a New York mile that is 40th Road.\nA tenth of a mile. Where Mandarin trumps English and a glance trumps the spoken word. Where sex is sold beside cloudy tanks of fish and crabs. Where seedy quarters controlled by local powers are rented to illicit massage operations, and the police make sporadic sweeps, and immigrant women are arrested again and again, and few in this city take notice.\nGravity prevails.\nThe undercover officer, his job done, exits the building and turns right \u2014 at the very moment that the woman who has just offered him intimacy for money hits the pavement at his feet. A woman known along 40th Road as SiSi, but whose given name was Song Yang.\nIn the Google Maps of the mind, pull back from this tiny street to take in the borough\u2019s 178-square-mile sprawl: a pulsating hive of parkways and boulevards, apartment buildings and single-family homes, two airports, a major league ballpark, remnants of a world\u2019s fair \u2014 all bracketed north and south by ocean, river and bay.\nA striving borough of comity and contradiction, Queens is both the birthplace of the American president \u2014 elected in part on an anti-immigration platform \u2014 and home to 2.3 million people, nearly half of them foreign-born. With hundreds of languages spoken here, it may be the most linguistically diverse place on earth.\nEvery day, airplanes alight at Kennedy International Airport in southeast Queens, their passengers including many immigrants who join the borough\u2019s anonymous, aspirational ranks. They chop the vegetables, wash the dishes, clean the toilets, mow the lawns, drive the hired cars.\nAnd some wind up in the commercial sex trade. Making money for a pimp in an airport motel in South Jamaica. Waiting for the next client in a dingy building along Roosevelt Avenue in Corona. Or, like Song Yang, standing on a Flushing street on a cold November night, hiding behind her cute nickname, calling out to men. Playing her role in a shadow economy that benefited others through the exorbitant rent she paid.\n\u201cI hear she was No. 1: young, pretty, and her service was great,\u201d said Michael Chu, a travel agent and community advocate who worked across the street from her on 40th Road. \u201cPeople just lined up for her.\u201d\nFor years now, Flushing has been an ever-replenishing repository of immigrants entangled in the underground sex economy. The commonplace raids of illicit massage operations across the country routinely lead to the arrests of women with Flushing addresses.\nThese parlors disappear and reappear with regularity, undermining the police crackdowns often prompted by neighborhood complaints. The industry\u2019s opaqueness adds to the confusion. Some parlors have legitimate state licenses; some legitimate operations have masseuses making sex-for-money side deals; and some are illegally unlicensed, with no interest at all in addressing someone\u2019s sore neck.\nEmotionally manipulated by their bosses, ashamed of what they do, afraid to trust, the women rarely confide in the police or even their lawyers about their circumstances. They might be supporting a family in China, or paying back a smuggling debt, or choosing this more profitable endeavor over, say, restaurant work. No matter the backstory, the police say their collective silence further complicates law-enforcement efforts to build racketeering and trafficking cases against the operators.\nBut society has become increasingly aware of the complexities and inequities of the commercial sex economy, including a criminal justice system that has tended to target the exploited \u2014 often immigrant women and members of the transgender community \u2014 while rarely holding accountable their customers and traffickers.\nIn early 2017, New York\u2019s police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, announced at a news conference that he would redirect his vice division to address prostitution and sex trafficking. This would include training intended to alter what he called the \u201claw-enforcement mind-set.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already switched much of our emphasis away from prostitutes, and begun focusing much more on the pimps who sell them and the johns who pay for their services,\u201d he said. \u201cLike all crime, we can\u2019t just arrest our way out of this problem.\u201d\nSince the establishment of this new \u201cmind-set,\u201d the police have continued to struggle at building criminal cases against the operators. But prostitution arrests in New York City have dropped more than 20 percent in the last year, while the arrests of customers have spiked.\nStill, this change in attitude at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan had not necessarily crossed the East River to benefit an immigrant now lying on her side, unable to speak, gazing up at a plainclothes officer trying to calm her until an ambulance arrived. Beside a spent cigarette, her blood pooled on the pavement she had so often worked.\nBy morning, Song Yang would be dead, shattering a tight Chinese family that would never accept the police version of events. Her death would also come to reflect the seemingly intractable nature of policing the sex industry, and cast an unwelcome light on the furtive but ubiquitous business of illicit massage parlors.\nIn the epic of Queens, this stretch of 40th Road is little more than an asphalt hyphen. But along its short expanse exist worlds within worlds within worlds.\nBaba, I want to go, I want to go.\nI want to go to work, the little girl would say to her parents. I want to pick ginseng. She was a born worker, their Song Yang.\nShe and her younger brother lived with their parents in a remote village in China\u2019s northeastern province of Liaoning, where they grew crops on land allotted to them by their local village committee. Little Song Yang was especially efficient at harvesting the family\u2019s ginseng crop, her mother, Shi Yumei, recalled. \u201cThe more her father praised her, the harder she worked.\u201d\nHer father, Song Xigui, eventually found moderate success selling construction-grade sand he bulldozed from a nearby river, and by the 1990s the family had replaced its thatched-roof home with a modern brick house that included two \u201ckang\u201d bed-stoves, heated slate platforms that provided warmth during the severe winters. Still, they continued to work the crops, with Song Yang often responsible for running home to light the stove, cut the vegetables and mind her brother.\nAs she grew older, she began to collect specimens of the enchanting butterflies zigzagging down by the river, and became meticulous in preserving their fragile iridescence. When friends came for boisterous sleepovers, they would marvel at her book of butterflies, and take turns asking to keep one.\nButterflies became Song Yang\u2019s gift.\nAt 19, she moved 2,200 miles south to Saipan, the largest of the Northern Mariana Islands, an American commonwealth, where she became one of the thousands of young Chinese women who labored in sweatshops to produce apparel bearing the guilt-absolving label \u201cMade in America.\u201d Sharing a room with five other women in a dormitory, she covered her bottom-bunk bed with a silken cloth curtain, and adorned her small rectangle of privacy with family photographs.\nSaipan\u2019s garment industry was shrinking by the early 2000s, and Song Yang left to become a waitress on the island. She married a worldly divorced father named Chau Chuong, an American citizen who had worked for years in New York\u2019s restaurant grind. He was so much older \u2014 67 to her 27 \u2014 that her family was slow to accept him.\nIn 2006, the couple opened a small Vietnamese restaurant on Saipan that became so successful they opened a second place, with 150 tables. He worked the kitchen and she worked the front. \u201cShe attracted a lot of friendly customers,\u201d her husband recalled.\nHer brother, Song Hai, joined her after his high school graduation, eventually opening a henna tattoo parlor with a friend. When their mother came for a visit, she posed for photographs beside her daughter\u2019s well-stocked restaurant bar, her smile radiating pride.\n\u201cWe had a real sense of accomplishment,\u201d Mr. Song said in Mandarin.\nBut a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011, disrupting a main source of tourism to Saipan, as well as the fortunes of Song Yang and Song Hai. The restaurants were sold, the tattoo parlor shuttered.\nPhotographs from her brother\u2019s wedding in March 2013 capture the last happy times that Song Yang spent with her family. Here she is back home, posing with the bride and groom. Here she is, sharing a restaurant meal with the growing family. Here she is.\nA month later, Song Yang joined the hundreds who arrive daily at Kennedy Airport, direct from China. Straight to Flushing she went, like so many before, where she hoped that she and her husband would succeed again as restaurateurs.\nBut there is the dream of Flushing, and the reality.\nWith her husband now too old for kitchen work, Song Yang became their sole source of income. A waitressing job failed, as did a short-lived Chinese fast-food venture on Main Street. So she became a home health aide, and took a massage-therapy course in the hope of earning additional money. Then a friend told her of a more lucrative opportunity, to be found along 40th Road.\nThe understanding of her parents and brother was that Song Yang worked in reflexology. They knew that gifts arrived from New York. That she called regularly for video chats while sitting in a black office chair, sometimes eating a bowl of porridge. That when her nephew was born, she proudly announced on social media that she had become an aunt \u2014 a \u201cgugu.\u201d\nThat she seemed happy, mostly. But there was that time when she refused to video-chat for several days, after which she explained that a man had beaten her about the face. And that other time, when she revealed that a man \u2014 a law-enforcement officer, she said \u2014 had held a gun to her head while forcing her to perform oral sex. Family members reassured her: She had no choice.\nSong Yang told her family last fall that she had booked a flight to China for December, and was looking forward to meeting her nephew for the first time. So far she had connected with him only online, through the popular WeChat app, where her avatar sometimes featured a butterfly.\nWhat kind of present do you want Gugu to bring home? she would ask the child, her image beamed halfway around the world from some exotic place called Flushing.\nThe thoroughfare known as 40th Road was Grove Street, once.\nIn the 19th century it had a volunteer firehouse, a nursery and residents with Irish surnames. Just in living memory, there was Harry Barlow\u2019s auto garage, the mimeograph services of Case the Printer, an appliance store proud of its color Zenith television sets and, of course, the Old Roma restaurant \u2014 famous for its veal cutlets on linguine, and that yellow sponge cake with pineapple filling.\nIt is all long gone, replaced by ginger duck rice casserole and a shaved ice treat called red bean baobing. The 40th Road of today is almost entirely Chinese, its restaurant signs often featuring no English at all \u2014 one more reminder that the only New York constant is change.\nThe street\u2019s 20 buildings, including Song Yang\u2019s, are mostly three- and four-story structures from the 1980s and \u201990s that evoke a utilitarian, Soviet-bloc drabness. Narrow and claustrophobic, they loom like set pieces for a film noir.\nThe one-way street itself always feels like a wrong turn, an obstacle course of idling delivery trucks and construction equipment. One end elbows past a small playground; the other runs into the ever-clogged Main Street intersection, where plainclothes police officers can often be seen sitting in an unmarked vehicle in an attempt to deter quality-of-life crimes. Pickpocketing is so prevalent that a nearby grocery displays signs of a stick figure reaching into another stick figure\u2019s handbag.\nAbove, looming airliners grumble as they approach LaGuardia Airport, across Flushing Bay. Just behind 40th Road, Long Island Rail Road trains grind and whine along the raised tracks. Up and down the block, the earthy aromas of produce stands and restaurant waste commingle with the classical Chinese instrumental music emanating from a soup-dumpling restaurant.\nAnd here, beside the upturned fruit crates and the overloaded garbage bags, stand the women of the massage parlors. In their 40s and 50s, mostly, they check their cellphones, drag on untaxed Korean cigarettes bought in bulk, and chat, but with eyes scanning for unattached men lacking a law-enforcement vibe.\nMassage?\nThe offer is understood, if not explicit. If the man consents, he is led up the stairs of one of the dull buildings, where massage operations are often crammed amid barbershops, driving schools and employment agencies.\nMassage parlors offering sex are hardly a recent phenomenon, and business models vary. But the trade along 40th Road is especially audacious. The women stand on both sides of the street \u2014 five, 10, a dozen at a time \u2014 as ubiquitous as the delivery trucks. In the merciless heat and cold, they sweat and shiver on staked ground, prompting resentful neighborhood complaints about lost business and children exposed to the seamy daily spectacle.\nA common arrangement on 40th Road is one in which a \u201cboss\u201d rents an apartment or office from one of the building\u2019s tenants, then provides space to women for a $20 cut of whatever they charge each client. The general expectation is that each woman will generate at least $100 a day for the boss.\nBut the bosses provide no meaningful protection. The women are at the mercy of the street, where they have been robbed, beaten, raped, thrown down stairs. The surveillance cameras nearly always present are intended less for security, perhaps, than to provide the boss with a way to count the clients who walk through the door.\nOver several months, the women along 40th Road shared in Mandarin the stories of how they came to be standing here, offering sex to strangers. They use names like masks. Some have chosen Americanized names \u2014 Jenny, for example \u2014 while others have been rechristened by bosses with nicknames that sound like Lala, or Kiki, or Yoyo.\nThey came from all over China, and from myriad backgrounds. One woman said she used to clean houses. Another said she was a former reporter who covered Chinese real estate. Several described the circumstances that left them in economic straits: a failed bus company, a bankrupt jade dealership, a gambling-addicted husband.\nOne woman often positions herself near a standpipe at the corner of Main Street, so as to be the first to approach any man venturing west. She is in her 60s, small-framed and usually dressed in layers, with long hair dyed black. She said in a raspy voice that she was from the southeastern Chinese province of Jiangxi, and that she was trying to pay off a debt incurred by her adult son in a business deal gone wrong.\nShe had visited two job agencies on 40th Road, looking for work as a nanny, but nothing panned out. And now she was here, on the corner, where her half-joking refrain \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m too old\u201d \u2014 did not seem to deter clients.\nAnother woman, who gave her name as Xiao Li \u2014 or Little Li \u2014 said she was from the city of Dexing, in Jiangxi Province, home to a well-known copper mine, where she once was a welder. Thin and often wearing a simple black dress, she said she had briefly left the street to study legitimate massage \u2014 \u201cSo my heart could have a little bit of peace\u201d \u2014 but had concluded that the classes were a waste of money. Back she came to 40th Road.\n\u201cMy body can\u2019t take it,\u201d Ms. Li, 50, said. \u201cMy body can\u2019t take so many men.\u201d\nOthers were even more expansive, including a stocky, 40-ish woman with cropped black hair and a lazy eye who called herself Rachel. Eating a sweet baked potato at a dumpling stall on Main Street, she recalled that while working at a job she loathed \u2014 waitressing at a Chinese restaurant in Seattle \u2014 she began hunting through WeChat forums for leads on other work, and came across an offer that she recalled saying:\nMassage Woman to Stand on Street. $20,000 a month. Flushing, N.Y.\nRachel called the number to ask what the job entailed. The boss replied: Everything.\nAfter her first day, Rachel said, \u201cI got home and took a shower, and cried.\u201d\nShe paused at the memory, and added, \u201cBut then I just thought to myself, \u2018I have to keep thinking positively.\u2019\u201d\nMichael Chu, the longtime neighborhood advocate, has befriended some of the women who stand outside his building on 40th Road, and occasionally offers them assistance with police matters. His office, where an old dog named Scout is usually napping on some cardboard, is furnished with desks left behind by an accountant who moved rather than work beside a massage parlor.\nA bespectacled man of 65, Mr. Chu has listened to the travails of these women, whom he calls \u201csisters.\u201d The beatings, the robberies, the harassment from teenagers in the playground, the pressure to attract enough clients to cover their \u201crent\u201d to the boss. The hopes they harbor for permanent residence, for having enough money, for finally not doing this.\n\u201cThey also have an American dream,\u201d Mr. Chu said. \u201cThe sisters have an American dream.\u201d\nThe man spotted her on the street one night after stopping at a 40th Road restaurant known for its cheap and plentiful food. She was pretty, younger than the other women and conversant in English, so he paid for a session. She said her name was SiSi.\nHis was Paul Hayes. Single, in his early 40s and living in Queens, he carried himself with a seen-it-all air \u2014 but she beguiled him. They gradually became lovers, then good friends with vague plans to rekindle their romance someday. But she lived with her husband in an apartment a block away. It was complicated.\nShe had a good sense of humor, and often solicited his advice \u2014 although she ignored him when he recommended bolstering the building\u2019s security system. She also confided about the dangers and vagaries of her work life.\n\u201cShe really hated doing it,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.\nEven so, Song Yang established herself as a fierce competitor in the circumscribed world of 40th Road. Fueled by coffee and Red Bull, she toiled nearly nonstop, as if facing some self-imposed deadline. Word was that she was trying to save up to open her own Vietnamese restaurant, or to buy a house in New York for her aging parents, or to just move on.\nHer sharp elbows and inexhaustible style irked some of the other women, leading to arguments, shoves and occasional hair pulling. One competitor recalled that if a man chose another masseuse, Song Yang would tease the client about preferring older women.\nBut another woman remembered a gentler, more generous Song Yang. She said that when she arrived at 40th Road, Song Yang insisted that she accept several pairs of pants to ward against winter.\nSong Yang\u2019s domain was a fourth-floor apartment at 135-32 40th Road, directly above another massage operation. The apartment door faced a boiler room and a makeshift gate that was intended to keep vagrants from sleeping on the roof, but also to protect the hot pepper plants nurtured there by the aged custodian.\nAs were most things on 40th Road, her rental arrangement was convoluted.\nThe building was constructed in 1992 by Jentai Tsai, 85, a prominent, even revered, banker in Flushing, and is owned by a real estate company overseen by his son, Eugene Morimoto Tsai. In a brief conversation last month, the younger Tsai, 42, said that he did not know that a woman had fallen from his building last year, or that his building had long been a hub of illicit massage activity.\nThey both said, and city records confirm, that the building\u2019s managing agent \u2014 responsible for collecting rent \u2014 was another man of local distinction: Peter Tu, 62, the longtime director of the Flushing Chinese Business Association, a member of Community Board 7 and a district leader for the Democratic Party.\nOutside his office around the corner, Mr. Tu at first denied that he was involved with the 40th Road building, but then said that he had merely tried to assist the Tsai family by collecting the $18,500 monthly rent from the main, first-floor tenant, the Shi Li Xiang seafood restaurant. He said he no longer served in this role, had never taken any payment \u201cfrom the street,\u201d and had no idea what arrangements the restaurant had with the tenants and subtenants upstairs.\n\u201cI\u2019m always in the middle,\u201d Mr. Tu said.\nA man identifying himself as the boss of the first-floor restaurant began to shout when asked about the tenants upstairs. \u201cHow am I supposed to know the names of the people to whom I rent?\u201d he asked in Mandarin. \u201cYou want me to go up and ask everyone who they are?\u201d\nAbove the restaurant, in this building owned and managed by Flushing men of stature, Song Yang paid a flat fee for her apartment \u2014 as much as $400 a night, competitors say \u2014 to a square-headed, elusive \u201cboss\u201d who goes by Lao Li, or Old Li, a kind of avuncular nickname conveying familiarity with the women who work for him. But the particulars of his subleasing arrangements are as difficult to pin down as he is.\nOne spring midnight, Lao Li made a rare appearance on 40th Road to mediate a dispute over clients that had erupted among the women. When a reporter approached and called him by name, Lao Li looked up \u2014 and bolted. He dashed east down the center of 40th Road, dodging cars, before vanishing into the dark Flushing night.\nAlthough Song Yang and other women often quarreled, they occasionally gathered with Lao Li at the restaurant downstairs, or at a nearby karaoke bar. They\u2019d watch him blow out a candle on his birthday cake, or sing along to a song popular in his native northeast China. At the Chinese New Year, he would hand out red envelopes containing small cash gifts.\nIn cellphone videos and photographs of these get-togethers, the participants could easily be mistaken for co-workers at an accounting firm, making a night of it. They seemed untroubled by their profession\u2019s many perils, including robbery, bodily harm \u2014 and, especially, arrest.\nArrest attracted unwelcome attention. It jeopardized applications for permanent residency. It magnified the humiliation. And it usually meant an appearance at the Human Trafficking Intervention Court, held on Fridays in the basement of the Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, where Mandarin sometimes seems as common as English.\nEstablished nearly 15 years ago, the court set out to treat women in the commercial sex trade less as accused criminals than as victims of trafficking and exploitation. They are told that charges will be dismissed and records sealed if they complete several individualized counseling sessions \u2014 focused, say, on job training, or education \u2014 with Garden of Hope, Restore NYC, Womankind or another outreach organization. A group called Sanctuary for Families is also on hand to provide immigration services.\nSong Yang went through this process more than once. In addition to expunging the arrests from her record, these court appearances provided pause, forcing her to confront the consequences of her work life.\nIn the summer of 2016, Song Yang began frequent WeChat dialogues with a Flushing lawyer, Chen Mingli, that at first focused on acquiring permanent residency \u2014 a process that he repeatedly told her could take months and months. Still, she fretted that her arrest history would thwart her application for a green card.\nI am having a lot of anxiety, she wrote in Chinese.\nGradually, though, their conversations came to reflect the darker realities of her 40th Road realm, with sobbing emoticons peppering her messages.\nGood morning, Lawyer Chen, she wrote in mid-October 2016. A police officer put a gun to my head today and forced me to perform oral sex.\nAt the insistence of a friend, she had filed a complaint with the 109th Precinct. Investigators spent the day in her \u201cshop,\u201d looking for evidence and checking the building\u2019s surveillance video, which had captured a heavyset bald man in a suit ascending the stairs.\nMr. Chen assured her that the matter would not affect the status of her immigration case, and implored her to cooperate with the police. But her intense desire to avoid attention, coupled with fear of retaliation from her attacker, overshadowed everything.\nThe police said that this won\u2019t affect me in any way, but I\u2019m afraid that it will \u2026 Lawyer Chen, what am I going to do now? \u2026 (Sob)(Sob)(Sob)\nThe police circulated a wanted poster based on a hazy photograph of the man lifted from the surveillance video. A retired United States Marshal, who surrendered after someone mentioned him as a possible suspect, participated in a lineup.\nBut Song Yang identified another man, wrongly, as her attacker. In addition, a DNA sample from the retired marshal did not match samples taken from Song Yang\u2019s clothing. The case was eventually closed.\nSeveral months later, in late September 2017, she was arrested a third time on a prostitution charge. Handcuffed, led away from 40th Road, held overnight.\nA few days later, Mr. Chen asked, You\u2019ve been arrested again?\nSong Yang answered:\nYeah. (Sob)(Sob)(Sob)\nShe explained that she had been forced to make hard decisions and that it had been difficult to suppress her feelings while married to a much older man who seemed increasingly removed from her day-to-day life. She felt \u201cmorally depraved,\u201d and sometimes thought about giving it all up and going home \u2014 or worse.\nI\u2019ve been having thoughts of jumping from a building, but what should I do? she wrote early one morning.\nMr. Chen was never formally hired by Song Yang, but now his central role seemed to be to buoy her spirits.\nDon\u2019t be scared, he wrote hours later. Don\u2019t think that way.\nSong Yang only sank deeper.\nI\u2019ve fallen so low I can\u2019t be saved.\nShe continued:\nWithout purpose, without direction, what meaning is there to keep on living?\nI used to be a woman who was very strong in her life. I strove for perfection in everything I did. I never thought that my life would turn out this way. I\u2019ve truly failed.\nAt the end of October, Song Yang made one last visit to Mr. Chen\u2019s office. She confided that another client had badly beaten her a couple of weeks earlier \u2014 an assault she had not reported to the police \u2014 and showed him photographs of her bruised and swollen face.\n\u201cWhy am I so unlucky?\u201d he remembers her asking.\nThe case began with an anonymous complaint: Several women were said to be \u201cselling intimacy\u201d at the building at 135-32 40th Road.\nThe tip hardly came as a revelation, since shady activities at this address had generated scores of 911 calls over the years. To some, the building even had the aura of being cursed, following a horrific crime in 2010, in which a deranged stalker stabbed a woman in the second-floor hallway and removed her heart and lungs.\nForty-three arrests had taken place in the building over the last decade, more than a few sex-related, the most recent that of Song Yang. Ensnared in an undercover sting in late September, she had tried but failed to hide in the cramped boiler room across from her apartment, and was charged with offering sex for $70.\nHer case, which had prompted those despairing messages to the lawyer Mr. Chen, was one of 91 massage-parlor-related arrests in the 109th Precinct in 2017, and one of six along 40th Road. According to court records, none of those arrests were for pimping, solicitation or operating an unlicensed massage parlor.\nA few nights after the anonymous complaint, a sergeant and a detective ended a brief surveillance by venturing into the notorious building. The only thing they found suspicious was a handwritten sign in Chinese on the second floor, which they believed to say, in effect, There are no girls on this floor; please go to the third floor.\nThe police later determined that the sign actually said, \u201cAttention, the driving school is on the third floor next door.\u201d\nAn undercover officer then telephoned a woman associated with the building who was known as SiSi. They arranged an appointment for the next evening, Saturday, Nov. 25. Her price: $120.\nOn the appointed day, members of the Queens North Vice Enforcement Squad met at their base in College Point to discuss the seven locations they planned to hit that night. The closest target became the first: the bleak building at 135-32 40th Road.\nThe vice officers went over their safety plan. They chose their identifying color of the day. They agreed upon the mission\u2019s assorted distress signals and code words, including what the primary undercover officer would say to indicate that sex had been offered for money. Now they were ready.\nThe 10-member team headed out into the evening, unseasonably mild for late November. They parked along Prince Street, across from the White Bear dumpling place and just short of where the one-way street bends east to become 40th Road. The team leader and two arresting officers sat in the first car, with two more arresting officers in the second car. The third vehicle was for prisoner transport.\nThe team tested its recording device, which used Bluetooth to transmit one-way audio. No problem. The green light was given: Go.\nMinutes later, the undercover officer approached his target, Song Yang, just inside her building\u2019s entrance. He wore an olive-green jacket, jeans and a cap. She wore a short winter coat, a red-and-black scarf, leggings and one of her signature headbands \u2014 with a small bow that resembled a butterfly.\nThe officer could not have known that this woman had just attempted a video chat with her younger brother, who was still asleep in China. That she had plans to fly home in December. That she had kept her court-mandated appointments with Restore NYC, a nonprofit organization that helps foreign-born victims of sex trafficking. That her fifth and last session with Restore was four days away.\nAbout all he knew was her police nickname for the night: \u201cJD Ponytail.\u201d\nJane Doe Ponytail.\nShe led him up the worn stairs. She gave him a peck of a kiss in the hall, and opened her apartment door. Another woman, brand-new to Flushing and known as Momo, was already occupied with a man in the second bedroom.\nSong Yang walked her client to her bedroom, where, according to the police, she offered sexual intercourse for the reduced price of $80. He consented to the arrangement and, heading to the bathroom, managed to utter the code word into his transmitter that a positive \u2014 that is, illegal \u2014 agreement had been reached. He also hoped to signal to colleagues that it was time to move in, but a wary Song Yang prevented him from having privacy, telling him to keep the bathroom door open.\n\u201cThis is bad service,\u201d the officer said.\nOnce in the bedroom, Song Yang became even more suspicious. Why aren\u2019t you taking off your clothes? she asked. Are you a cop?\nNo, he answered. But he complained again about the service and grabbed his hat, prepared to leave. She pushed him out and closed the door.\nResponding to the undercover officer\u2019s signal, the three idling police vehicles turned onto 40th Road, smack into its everlasting gridlock. Four officers got out and hustled to the building. Climbing the dreary stairs, they passed their undercover colleague, who pointed to Song Yang\u2019s door as he descended \u2014 and as she watched on the monitor in her apartment.\nWith the police demanding that she open the door, and preparing to break it down, a panicked Song Yang hurried to the apartment\u2019s north balcony. The other woman, Momo, emerged naked from her bedroom to investigate the noise, but hustled back to hide when she realized it was the police.\nThe balcony was not equipped with surveillance cameras, leaving what happened next to the imagination. It is possible that Song Yang was hoping to escape, perhaps by reaching for a wire that ran vertically past her balcony. It is possible that she was trying to land on the protruding metal sign of the restaurant below. It is also possible that she intended to kill herself.\nIt is fact that she hit the pavement directly in front of the undercover officer she had pecked on the cheek just five minutes earlier. His supervisors say that the officer remains shaken to this day.\nLater that night, while Song Yang was lying in a hospital bed with multiple fractures to her face, head and body, the police placed her under arrest. She died in the morning \u2014 and the arrest was, in the parlance of the police, \u201cvoided.\u201d\nIn the dark of an early December morning, two weary travelers shuffled through the multicultural scrum of Kennedy Airport. One was a tall, reedy man named Song Hai; the other, a slight, older woman named Shi Yumei, whose protracted weeping on the long flight from Beijing had concerned an attendant.\nSong Yang\u2019s mother and brother had traveled 7,000 miles to better understand the how and the why of her death.\nA telephone call from her husband several nights earlier had disrupted everything. Song Yang is dead, he had said. Police say she jumped from a building.\nHer distraught parents had telephoned their other child, Song Hai, to deliver words so heavy that he dropped his smartphone, cracking its glass. Not accepting what he heard, he sent a WeChat message to his sister that depicted a pair of clinking coffee mugs, along with a gentle request to please call home.\nThe lack of an answer was the answer.\nThe mother and brother spent their first two weeks in Flushing tending to the affairs of death. Then, on a dismal day of late December rain, they made their way to the Chun Fook funeral home, a few blocks from 40th Road. Though some had recommended a modest ceremony, the family had insisted on a more elaborate service, in a spacious room with a chandelier.\nThe dark wood coffin sat at the front before rows of chairs that would remain empty. No women from 40th Road. No Lao Li. A pair of vertical scrolls with parallel aphorisms written in Chinese calligraphy \u2014 \u201cPut Down Your Burdens and Return to the Lord\u201d and \u201cTake Up Tranquillity and Celebrate Everlasting Life\u201d \u2014 hung on either side.\nOne minister delivered prayers in English, while another repeated those prayers in Mandarin. The few mourners included Song Yang\u2019s close friend Paul Hayes; the community advocate Michael Chu; Chen Mingli, the lawyer who had tried to help her seek permanent residency; her husband, Chau Chuong, now 78, who had come from California, where he had been living for his health; and her mother and brother, their heads bowed and hands folded.\nThe ceremony ended with the reading from the Book of Common Prayer that we are all from dust, and to dust we shall return. Alleluia, the mourners mumbled. Alleluia.\nThen it was a short drive along the Grand Central Parkway to the All Souls Chapel and Crematory at St. Michael\u2019s Cemetery. This is where Song Yang\u2019s battered body was returned to dust, and where, in his frustration and grief, her brother vowed justice and punched a wall.\nThe official explanation for his only sibling\u2019s death made no sense to Mr. Song. After all, she had already paid for her flight home to celebrate their mother\u2019s upcoming birthday and to meet, for the first time, his 5-year-old son. Suicide was not possible, he reasoned. Darker forces might be at play. He had already begun his own investigation.\nOne snowy night soon after arriving from China, Mr. Song appeared at his sister\u2019s 40th Road building with Mr. Hayes. Their plan was to break into her apartment, collect her belongings \u2014 and, if possible, retrieve any surveillance video.\nMr. Song, a learning specialist by trade, and Mr. Hayes, a computer consultant, crept up the 50 tiled steps to the fourth-floor door, which was secured with a locked chain. Fearing the noise of the hammer and small acetylene torch they had planned to use, Mr. Hayes hustled to a Home Depot a mile away and returned with a hacksaw.\nAfter a few minutes of sawing, the chain gave way, and the two men pushed open the dull-gray door to enter the setting of a life interrupted. The police had taken the surveillance equipment, but everything else made it seem as if Song Yang might return at any minute.\nIn the two bedrooms, rumpled sheets. In the kitchen, a Pepsi and a half-empty bottle of Bacardi, sliced carrots and apples, and the black chair that Mr. Song recognized as the one his sister sat in while video-chatting with her family. In the living room, a raised table with a red curtained skirt, on which sat a CD player, a pair of sunglasses and a lucky cat figurine. Placed neatly on the floor, a pair of pink shoes.\nOn the snow-dusted front balcony, a broom, an upside-down bucket, a stool, a few plastic bags containing fruit and eggs. And, just beyond, the beckoning lights and shadows of the street below.\nSong Hai returned often to 40th Road, a spectral presence in his dark hooded coat and black cap, a cigarette cupped in his hand. He cajoled and confronted the sidewalk\u2019s denizens, asking questions, taking photographs, recording conversations. He saw himself as a lone-wolf investigator, working to prove that corrupt officers of this strange city had thrown Song Yang over the railing.\nHis ever-evolving theory:\nThat his sister had been sexually assaulted by a police officer. That she had filed a complaint. That the subsequent police lineup was fixed to protect the assailant. Then it was payback, which explained why, of all the women along 40th Road, only Song Yang was arrested in September, and was about to be arrested again in late November.\nAs is standard when a death occurs during a police action, the Queens district attorney and the police department\u2019s Force Investigation Division were investigating. But Mr. Song was already beginning to believe that nearly every corner of the American criminal justice system \u2014 from the police to the medical examiner \u2014 was colluding to hide the truth.\nHe patrolled downtown Flushing. He interrogated women and shopkeepers. He plastered the streets with leaflets featuring photographs of his sister and promising a \u201cBig Reward!\u201d The plea appeared in Chinese and in fractured English:\nHello! When you saw the photo, SiSi (Song Yang) was no longer alive. She fell from and died on 11/25/2017 at 135-32 4FL in Flushing. Families as well as the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau are eager to find out the truth of her death. If you have ANY CLUES, please contact me ASAP. Absolutely Confidential \u2026 (Her brother Song Hai)\nThe dozens of responses yielded little. One man called to say that Song Hai\u2019s sister was a whore \u2014 a word he did not quite understand, and so he continued the conversation: Yes, yes. And do you have information?\nHis sleuthing occasionally paid off. One evening, amid the Main Street crush, Mr. Song spotted a man he recognized from his sister\u2019s WeChat photographs: short, solidly built, and with a distinctive, block-shaped head.\nExcited, Mr. Song crossed the street and, right at the Roosevelt Avenue intersection, near the subway entrance, grabbed the man by the arm. Mr. Song recalled what happened next:\nAre you Li? he asked.\nYou\u2019re mistaken, replied the startled Lao Li, the boss who controlled Song Yang\u2019s apartment. My name is not Li.\nMr. Song waved down a passing police car, as a crowd gathered and the agitated man in his grip implored him not to involve the authorities. Let\u2019s resolve this ourselves.\nThe two officers understood Mr. Song\u2019s intentions, he later recalled, but they explained that this was America, not China, and that he was unlawfully detaining a man who wasn\u2019t present when his sister\u2019s fall took place. They separated the men, and Lao Li floated away in the rush-hour stream.\nLater that evening, an angry Lao Li telephoned Mr. Song. In the conversation that Mr. Song duly recorded on his phone, Lao Li vented about the audacity of summoning the police \u2014 \u201cIf you don\u2019t have evidence, how could you say I\u2019m the boss?\u201d \u2014 before giving his version of the realities on 40th Road.\nHe said that he rented the apartment to Song Yang for $3,100 a month \u2014 hardly the $12,000 that was rumored on the street. \u201cShe and I really didn\u2019t have any employment relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that at the start of the month, I would take the rent.\u201d\nLao Li said she called him her \u201cboss\u201d so that others wouldn\u2019t bully her, but he insisted that she was her own boss: prone to arrest, sure, but also smart, tenacious and tough.\nThroughout the conversation, Lao Li characteristically remained at a distance \u2014 even when describing that fateful night. He rushed to 40th Road after receiving a call that \u201cSiSi had jumped from the building,\u201d he said, but by the time he got there, \u201cyour sister had already been taken away.\u201d\nAs Mr. Song conducted his frustrating investigation, his mother spent her days in the numbing cocoon of grief. Once so proud of her entrepreneurial children, Shi Yumei was now a sorrowful woman in a foreign world, gingerly navigating a small cart down crowded Main Street, her pale gray knit cap pulled low, her mind occupied with worry. How, for example, would she and her son, here on temporary visas, survive on the little money they had brought with them?\nAn encounter with a bellowing street evangelist eventually led her to St. George\u2019s, the old Episcopal church on Main Street whose steeple has long been a Flushing landmark. Its congregation embraced her, smothering her with food, clothing and compassion. Locking hands and forming a prayer circle one day, strangers asked God to grant peace to this new person among them, who felt so blessed that she began to volunteer at the church\u2019s food pantry as a way of giving back.\nOne cool April morning, she donned an orange apron and joined 40 other volunteers, nearly all of them immigrants, as they prepared for the ritual that unfolds every Wednesday along the old church\u2019s north side, opposite a Lucille Roberts fitness center. They unloaded the crates from trucks, bagged the fruit and vegetables, and established an assembly line of food down the sidewalk: turnips and fennel, lettuce and apples, onions and melons.\nThe decade-old operation had gradually adapted to the ways of Flushing, with organizers taking note of the tensions caused by different understandings of personal space among ethnic groups. The solution: two alternating lines \u2014 one that was entirely Asian, and the other a mix of black, white and Latino.\nOn this morning, the Asian line ran alongside the church\u2019s cemetery wall, and the other line stretched down to a firehouse. But things moved apace, thanks in large part to the high-spirited efficiency of the volunteers \u2014 including Shi Yumei, who smiled at her sense of belonging as she proffered bags of onions.\nEach evening, after long days of volunteering and investigating, mother and son returned to a worn apartment catering to transients, not far from 40th Road. Some lodgers paid $20 a night for a narrow bed in the living room. But with some financial help from the church and a few nonprofit organizations, Mr. Song and Ms. Shi managed to pay $1,000 a month for a cramped bedroom and first dibs on a shared kitchen.\nThey slept beside a closet packed with clothes and accessories that Song Yang left behind. Tears were shed over a single strand of black hair found on a coat. They lived in the presence of her absence.\nTo find sleep, the mother would hold a small audio device close to her ear and listen to lively recorded stories about historical Chinese triumphs, cuddled beside one of her daughter\u2019s plush teddy bears. This way, Ms. Shi said in Mandarin, \u201cI know my daughter is here with me.\u201d\nTwo feet away, her son would lie in his twin bed near the window, cigarettes on the nightstand, spent beer cans under the bed, another Long Island Rail Road train clattering in the distance. Here he would try to piece together the stray bits of his investigation.\nHe had found a grainy photograph from his sister\u2019s WeChat feed of the stocky, bald man who had supposedly sexually assaulted her, and convinced himself that a bald police detective, appearing in cellphone videos taken on the sidewalk after his sister\u2019s fall, was the same man.\nHe had also obtained photographs and forensic notes from the autopsy. Poring over the graphic images, he decided that the discoloration around his sister\u2019s face came from a beating, and that her broken fingernails suggested some kind of struggle \u2014 and, therefore, a cover-up.\nThis was America. Not China. Exactly.\nOn a sunny spring day, those invested in the proceedings of the human trafficking court filed into the basement courtroom in Kew Gardens. Among them were Song Hai, in a black blazer and brown work boots, and Shi Yumei, her blue-and-orange scarf recalling the colors seen on the Staten Island Ferry, on Knicks uniforms, on Mets baseball caps \u2014 the colors of New York.\nThey took their seats among the defendants, including a woman in glasses often seen calling out to men on 40th Road. Mr. Song sat with his hands clasped and back erect; his mother was bent forward, as if in prayer. They waited.\nAn air of empathy defines the court, which is intended to encourage women engaged in the commercial sex trade to avail themselves of counseling and other diversionary programs. On most Fridays, the judge, the prosecutor and the defense lawyer are women, and the lanky head court officer is determined to make the defendants feel safe and respected. He does his best to dissuade any pimps or bosses from taking a seat.\nProminent in the dozen pews are Chinese women facing the usual massage-parlor-related charges of prostitution or unlicensed massage. Court-appointed lawyers from the Legal Aid Society or Queens Law Associates usually guide them through the process, along with a Mandarin-speaking interpreter and advocates from one of the nonprofit groups specializing in sex-trafficking outreach and immigration services.\nDefenders of the program maintain that until a better approach is developed, arrests \u2014 followed by appearances in trafficking court \u2014 provide the best chance for intervention. Even if a woman returns to 40th Road, they say, she will at least have the names of people to contact if she needs help.\nOthers, though, counter that for many women caught in the commercial sex trade, an arrest only exacerbates their trauma. Besides, they say, one doesn\u2019t need to be arrested in order to receive helpful contact information.\nJudge Toko Serita, who has presided over the trafficking court for a decade, summons the defendants, one by one, to stand before her, as a court officer calls out, \u201cMandarin interpreter required, and present.\u201d The judge has short black hair, glasses and a welcoming, even reassuring demeanor, whether it\u2019s the defendant\u2019s first appearance or her last.\nHow are you today? \u2026 Are you studying English? \u2026 This is a really good streak \u2026 I want to congratulate you for completing all your sessions with Garden of Hope \u2026 Stay out of trouble, lead a law-abiding life for the next six months, and the record will be expunged \u2026 Good luck to you.\nOn this morning, several cases were heard before a court officer finally called out: \u201c03585 dash 17. Yang Song!\u201d\nEven though she was five months dead, Song Yang still had an open criminal case: the arrest on a prostitution charge two months before her fatal fall. The sprawling New York City judicial system may seem overwhelmed, even chaotic, but in the end its books must be balanced. This meant that a formality known as an \u201cabatement by death\u201d \u2014 a dismissal, in effect \u2014 was required to close the short chapter on Song Yang, or Yang Song, as the system sometimes rendered her name.\nJudge Serita was informed that the deceased defendant\u2019s mother and brother were present and would like to thank the court. The request stilled the courtroom. The judge sighed in sympathy.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cUm. All right. This case is now going to be abated by death.\u201d\nShe went on to tell Song Yang\u2019s mother and brother that everyone involved in the trafficking court was deeply saddened by their loved one\u2019s \u201ctragic and untimely death.\u201d She expressed hope that they \u201csomehow find peace with these unfortunate circumstances.\u201d\nMr. Song and Ms. Shi acknowledged her words with nods. They walked out of the courtroom, past an \u201cExit Only \u2014 No Re-Entry\u201d sign, and into the late-morning brightness. He lit a cigarette. She adjusted her backpack. They continued on in silence.\nTwo weeks later, the mother and brother returned to Kew Gardens for a long-awaited meeting with investigators from the Homicide Investigations Bureau of the Queens district attorney\u2019s office. With everyone seated around a dark-wood conference table in a windowless room, the investigators shared the results of their monthslong inquiry, including 22 minutes of video culled from cameras positioned both inside and outside the building at 135-32 40th Road.\nIn these images, their beloved daughter and sister appears in the fullness of life. Here is Song Yang, leading the undercover officer up the stairs. Here she is, kicking him out of the apartment, watching the officers ascend the stairs \u2014 rushing in alarm toward the balcony.\nHere, from street level, something falling, and then a beloved daughter and sister, crumpled on the pavement. Watching the video again a few days later, Ms. Shi noticed the headband that flies off her daughter\u2019s head.\n\u201cShe especially loved butterflies,\u201d the mother said.\nThe video over, the investigators laid out their sober findings: The police involved in a bust-and-buy sting on 40th Road the night of Nov. 25, 2017, did not cause the death of Song Yang. To begin with, no officer was even in the fourth-floor apartment when she jumped or fell.\nHer brother scoffed at this conclusion. He said something rude in Mandarin. Meeting over.\nNight comes to 40th Road.\nThe fruit and vegetable peddlers have boxed up and boarded up, and the last patrons of air-conditioned restaurants have stepped out to evaporate in the late June warmth. But the women are here, as always, calling out an invitation that sounds almost like a plea.\nMassage?\nThey stand outside the same doorways, including the one for 135-32, where Song Yang once lingered. Very soon after she died, her fourth-floor apartment became the address for a new massage business. Its name: Heaven on Fourth.\nA few steps away, at the entrance to another of the gloomy buildings owned and operated by prominent Flushing businessmen, a thin woman in a brown dress sits in a metal chair with a square of Styrofoam for padding, studying her cellphone through the smoke of her cigarette. Then she pulls out a bag of overripe cherries from the building\u2019s broken mailbox and, between the repeated offerings of her services, spits out the pits and tosses them into the street, not far from a lamppost adorned with a poster bearing the face of Song Yang (\u201cBig Reward!\u201d).\nTo the woman\u2019s right, roasted duck carcasses hang in the window of the Corner 28 restaurant, where a man is mop-swabbing the sticky floor. To her left, sorrowful creatures loll in a seafood restaurant\u2019s murky tank. Above her head, scaffolding provides protection from the stucco that city officials say has been coming loose from the buildings. Rain begins to fall.\nA nearby tanker truck groans as it sucks away a restaurant\u2019s used cooking oil through a large hose that snakes across the sidewalk and into the bowels of a building. The women adapt: They step over the hose, ignore the smell, raise their voices.\nOne of the women leads a potential client to a building\u2019s threshold, but he keeps walking; she mutters an epithet in Mandarin. Then a buzz-cut junkie, who just hours before was asleep on the pavement, begins to harass the women, disrupting their business by hovering, touching, dropping his sweatpants and simulating sex acts. He enters one of their buildings and urinates in the hall.\nThe rain hardens. The whoosh of a shuttered metal gate resounds. A kitchen worker emerges at the end of his shift and wishes the women a good night. They wish him the same.\nIt is all ephemeral, of course, a realization reinforced daily by the laborers trudging down this street to the subway, bone-weary from working another of the construction projects that are redefining Flushing. Few today remember the Old Roma restaurant that once thrived on 40th Road, just as few tomorrow will remember a Chinese immigrant who once died on 40th Road.\nFor now, at least, if you linger on the street, you will encounter those who remember her \u2014 including, occasionally, clients still looking for SiSi.\nYou might see Lala, and Kiki, and Yoyo, along with other women who competed with Song Yang. You might see her lanky brother, Song Hai, who still struggles to understand why no one will be brought to justice for all that his sister went through in her adopted country. His grief smolders, as does his distrust of America.\nLastly, you might see Song Yang\u2019s mother, Shi Yumei.\nOne evening, Ms. Shi paused outside a building where some women were offering massages to passing men. Raising the drooping bags held in her hands, she explained that she had just left the food pantry at the Episcopal church on Main Street, where she had recently been baptized. She said the pastor had emphasized the importance of sharing what you have.\nThe mother placed a bag of sweet potatoes in the doorway that had once been Song Yang\u2019s domain. It was an offering of sorts, a gift to women like her daughter. Then she was gone, assumed into the Flushing blur.\nAmong those providing information for this story were: Assistant District Attorneys Suzanne Bettis and Robert Ciesla and Chief Assistant District Attorney John M.

Even fewer can be considered newsworthy.\nThe exception was one in The Times on Thursday, calling for Edward J. Snowden to be offered clemency or a plea bargain. By midday, it had already drawn well over 1,200 online comments, as well as articles about it in other media outlets, including Politico, Fox News, The Nation, and USA Today.\nAndrew Rosenthal, The Times\u2019s editorial page editor, told me Thursday that the editorial had been under discussion by the editorial board for weeks. The Times has written strong editorials about Mr. Snowden ever since the former contractor for the National Security Agency emerged into the national consciousness last spring. In general, The Times\u2019s editorial page has supported Mr. Snowden, calling him a whistle-blower who has done a public service for American citizens by revealing vast \u2013 and unconstitutional \u2013 government surveillance.\nBut the moment for something larger arrived more recently, Mr. Rosenthal said.\n\u201cIt felt like there was a real critical mass,\u201d he said, with recent rulings by federal judges, Congress\u2019s bipartisan consideration of legal changes, the recommendations of a panel appointed by President Obama, and the unified statement of protest by Internet companies, who are not normally great champions of privacy.\n\u201cWith all of that, and year ending, it seemed like a great moment to say it,\u201d he said.\nThe editorial\u2019s general stance, as usual, was agreed upon by the board and assigned to a lead writer, with contributions from others. (Mr. Rosenthal did not write this editorial, although he does occasionally write editorials in addition to a regular blog.) An editorial in The Guardian has also called for a pardon.\nThe Times\u2019s editorial has garnered praise from some \u2013 and some notable vitriol from others, he said.\n\u201cSadly, many of those have been obscene and hate-filled,\u201d he said. They include very strongly worded ad hominem attacks both on Mr. Snowden and on Mr. Rosenthal, he said. He read me one particularly vicious example, which I won\u2019t reproduce here.\n\u201cWe did say that the idea of political asylum,\u201d advanced by some, \u201cis bizarre.\u201d And, he noted, that Mr. Snowden \u201cseems to have violated his security clearance.\u201d\nAs for the extremely politicized nature of the response \u2013 with support for Mr. Snowden coming largely from the left \u2013 Mr. Rosenthal said that, by rights, \u201cconservatives should be the most outraged\u201d because of the intrusion of government that they normally oppose.\nThe most heartening response, he said, was from readers who said that The Times\u2019s editorial \u201chad forced them to sit down and really consider what they thought.\u201d For some, at least, the editorial brought about \u201cmore textured thinking\u201d on a difficult subject.\nDoes Mr. Rosenthal really think President Obama will take the board\u2019s highly unusual recommendation seriously?\n\u201cThat\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d he said, noting that the pressure on the president is intense by all sides. He added, \u201cWe have been very disappointed with him on these issues.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he added, \u201cyou have to go beyond what is realistic\u201d in an editorial recommendation, not necessarily saying what might happen but rather, \u201cthis is what should happen.\u201d\nLike The Times\u2019s editorial board, I believe that Mr. Snowden has done the United States, and in fact, the world, a great service.\nI agree wholeheartedly with this line in the editorial\u2019s concluding paragraph: \u201cWhen someone reveals that government officials have routinely and deliberately broken the law, that person should not face life in prison at the hands of the same government.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In the Philippines, an American-backed military campaign has the Abu Sayyaf Group,\nan Islamic extremist organization with links to Jemaah Islamiyah, clinging to footholds in the jungles of a handful of southern islands, officials said.\nIndonesia and the Philippines, which have faced the most serious terrorist threat in the region, have taken sharply different approaches to combat it. Each has achieved some success, offering lessons to American and\nallied counterterrorism efforts worldwide. But there are worrisome signs that the threat could rebound quickly.\nA bombing at a Philippine air base in the southern island of Mindanao late last month killed two people and wounded 22 others. Peace talks between the Philippine government and the country\u2019s main Muslim separatist\ngroup are threatening to fall apart, which could ignite wider violence, building on deep anger about the country\u2019s military-first approach against Muslims. In February, the head of Jemaah Islamiyah in Singapore\nslipped out a prison bathroom window, hopped a fence and disappeared.\nBut senior American officials, government authorities in the region and counterterrorism specialists say that the most serious threats are on the wane \u2014 in contrast to American intelligence assessments that Al\nQaeda in the Pakistani tribal areas is resurgent and that regional affiliates like Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb are gaining strength.\n\u201cThe governments out here take it very seriously and, in my opinion, seem to be doing a very good job individually and working together to deal with that terrorist threat,\u201d Defense Secretary Robert M.\nGates, a former director of central intelligence, told reporters on June 1 at a regional security conference here.\nSenior American intelligence officials began noting progress earlier this year. \u201cSoutheast Asia continues to be a concern, although not nearly that which we might have envisioned two or three years ago,\u201d\nMichael E. Leiter, acting director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in a speech in Washington in February.\nThe United States and Australia, in particular, have played major roles in helping Southeast Asian countries combat terrorist threats in the region.\nMore than 500 American personnel, including experts from the military Special Operations Forces, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Agency for International Development, are\ntraining and working with Philippine counterterrorism forces from a base in Zamboanga, a city in Mindanao.\nThe Pentagon recently awarded the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia a total of $27 million in coastal surveillance stations equipped with special radar, heat-detecting cameras and computers to help disrupt terrorists\nplying the Sulawesi sea lanes, according to documents sent to Congress. The Philippines also received nearly $6 million in night-vision goggles, body armor, helmets and radios.\nIn Indonesia, the Australian police provided sophisticated electronic surveillance capabilities that allowed local security forces to locate within days several militants who carried out an even deadlier bombing in\nBali in 2002. The Australians are still helping the Indonesian police monitor telephone traffic, and, along with American officials, have helped train Indonesian lawyers, prosecutors and judges.\nIn contrast to the Philippines, where the United States is backing a more militarized approach, Indonesia has taken a different tack, in which terrorist suspects are treated well and encouraged to defect or to share\ninformation.\nIndonesia explains that its friendly handling of detainees will make its government seem less of an enemy of Islam. The Indonesian police are skillful interrogators, their Western counterparts say, and there have been\nno credible reports of torture being used in Indonesia to break the rings or win the prosecutions.\nAt the same time, the Indonesian government has been sentencing some prominent captives to long prison terms. Zarkasih, who uses one name and is believed to have been the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah from 2005 until his\narrest last year, was sentenced in April to 15 years in prison. Abu Dujana, a deputy who led the group\u2019s military arm and was also arrested last year, was also sentenced to 15 years.\nAzhari Husin, one of the most feared bomb makers in Asia, was killed by Indonesia\u2019s elite antiterrorism unit in 2005, but his second in command, Noordin Top, is still at large, American intelligence officials\nsaid.\n\u201cOverall, the threat is far less in Indonesia than it was two or three years ago,\u201d said Sidney Jones, a senior adviser to the International Crisis Group in Jakarta and an expert on terrorism in Southeast\nAsia.\nLt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, voiced cautious optimism to Congress in February about the situation in Indonesia. He noted, though, that the fact that Indonesian authorities\nwere seizing caches of weapons showed that insurgents were still trying to mount attacks.\nIn the Philippines, the government and the Pentagon say that the threat of the Abu Sayyaf has substantially diminished over the past few years, noting that several of the group\u2019s top officers, including its leader,\nKhaddfy Janjanlani, have been killed and its ranks have dwindled to about 200 from more than 1,000 in 2001, according to terrorism experts.\nBut there are clear indications the group can still do damage. In the attack on the Philippine air base on May 29, a cellphone-detonated bomb was apparently concealed in a bag belonging to a civilian commuter waiting\nto hitch a ride on a C-130 cargo plane outside Edwin Andrews Air Base in Zamboanga, police officials said.\nThe Philippine government blamed Abu Sayyaf as well as elements of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a separatist group that has been fighting for an Islamic state in Mindanao for decades and that has been involved\nin peace talks with Manila.\nIt was not the first time that the Front had been accused of colluding with Abu Sayyaf. In the past, accusations that it had helped the group, as well as Jemaah Islamiyah, had threatened the peace negotiations, with\nthe Front remaining adamant that it had nothing to do with these terrorists. It had said it would withdraw from the negotiations if the government continued its accusations.\nAn American-supported \u201ccivil action\u201d campaign in the Philippines, involving building infrastructure for social services in communities and financing medical missions, has gained some praise. But in general,\nthe government\u2019s campaign against Abu Sayyaf has been dominated by a heavy military approach that is often seen as broadly categorizing all Muslims together as a threat, which terror experts and analysts\nfear could backfire.\n\u201cMy real concern is that Philippine government has never had a comprehensive policy with Muslims in Mindanao,\u201d said Zachary Abuza, an expert on terrorism in Southeast Asia who teaches at Simmons College\nin Boston.\nLumping the Islamic Front with Abu Sayyaf will inflame those Filipino Muslims who are seeking self-determination through a peace effort, and make it harder for the Front to cooperate in fighting terrorism, said Abhoud\nSyed Lingga, the executive director of the Institute of Bangsamoro Studies, a research organization on Islamic issues in Cotabato City, in Mindanao.\n\u201cU.S. forces are strengthening the Philippine military and using civic action to drive a wedge between rebels and the Muslim populace,\u201d said a recent report by the International Crisis Group that referred\nto the Abu Sayyaf Group. \u201cBut if their goal is to defeat the A.S.G. and its foreign, mainly Indonesian, jihadi allies, they are casting the net too widely and creating unnecessary enemies.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

During contract talks, the unions, conceding that times were tough in the copper business, agreed to a three-year wage freeze but insisted on cost-of-living increases tied to the consumer price index - a demand that had been accepted by other industry giants like Kennecott, Asarco, Inspiration Consolidated Copper and Magma Copper. But Phelps Dodge refused. In fact, the company argued for cuts in wages and benefits and an end to cost-of-living protection.\nHOLDING THE LINE\nWomen in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983.\nBy Barbara Kingsolver.\nOn July 1, workers in the remote Arizona mining towns of Morenci, Ajo, Bisbee and Douglas walked off the job. From that moment forward, according to Ms. Kingsolver's admittedly biased report (\"I was, from the outset, sympathetic to the strikers' cause\"), the dispute between the company and the unions began to sound like something out of the 1930's. Within days the striking miners were being subjected to unlawful arrests, firings, evictions, undercover surveillance by the Arizona Criminal Intelligence Systems Agency, injunctions limiting picketing and demonstrations, blacklistings - all the well-established methods of physical and psychological intimidation used to demoralize an opposition. \"Scabs\" soon replaced union workers. In a move reminiscent of pre-World War I days when Pinkerton detectives were frequently hired to bust strikes (and workers' heads), the Arizona Department of Public Safety and the National Guard were called in by Gov. Bruce Babbitt in order for peace \"to be maintained\" in the towns of Clifton and Morenci. Their presence, a lot of people felt, was more like an \"occupation.\"\nIt was, Ms. Kingsolver suggests, an astonishing display of institutional recalcitrance. Phelps Dodge simply dug in its heels and refused to negotiate in good faith on any issue. Over the ensuing four years, hundreds of lives were disrupted, if not completely destroyed (marriages collapsed, friendships fell apart, families divided), three or four thriving communities were turned into virtual ghost towns and Phelps Dodge, deliberately committing a kind of corporate suicide according to the author, went out of the copper business in Arizona. By 1987 there wasn't much left of the mines or the miners.\nWhat is fascinating about all this, for those readers who are neither labor historians, copper miners nor Phelps Dodge shareholders, is not so much the drama of a specific strike, as the broader questions raised by the outcome about the future of organized labor - questions like, how much power do unions really have now, and what level of support can they realistically expect from workers in other industries? How far does a commitment to other union shops go before self-interest undermines the intent to support political action? What protections under the law are going to be enforced? Is the real lesson of the great Arizona mine strike that collective bargaining these days is little more than a remembrance of things past?\nUnfortunately, \"Holding the Line\" does not devote much space to these matters, and in reflecting on their importance in Ms. Kingsolver's book at all, I am, I confess, extracting from the text that which interests me most. Ms. Kingsolver, a journalist living in Arizona and a fiction writer whose books \"The Bean Trees\" and \"Homeland and Other Stories\" have been highly praised, is most interested, as her subtitle and her preface make explicit, in the role women, many of whom were miners or the wives, daughters and sisters of miners, played in this specific strike, and the emergence of a feminist consciousness among a poor, largely Hispanic minority subgroup traditionally excluded from the union hall.\n\"For several reasons I set out to write a book about women,\" Ms. Kingsolver says. \"The women's lives were transformed in more obvious and compelling ways [than men's lives] . The dominant role they assumed in maintaining the long strike appeared to be one of the unique features of the conflict.\" Fair enough. But the problem is that since the narrative that follows gives us little idea how, or even if, male lives were transformed, there is no way for the reader to judge whether their story is less obvious, less compelling and less worthy, therefore, of inclusion. Moreover, since we are told almost nothing about what the men of these small towns of Morenci, Clifton, Ajo, Bisbee and Douglas did with themselves during the four years of the strike, we have to take the author's word for it that women played the dominant role in sustaining the strike.\nIndeed, one of the unique features of \"Holding the Line\" (unintentional, I am sure) is the illusion it creates in the reader's mind that men do not exist in the mining towns of Arizona at all - except as occasional walk-on villains. When a man does make an appearance in the narrative, he is generally a cop, a churlish supervisor, an unenlightened union boss, a scab or an angry husband unable to deal with the strength of his wife's convictions. In part this is the result of the author's heavy reliance on direct quotation from extensive interviews she conducted over a two-year period with some 75 informants - \"mostly women.\" The point of view is, quite naturally, theirs. In part, however, it shows the absence of a balancing authorial hand. Though I grant Ms. Kingsolver her purpose and accept her judgments, she leaves me with the sense that events she describes take place in a world in which the male sex is missing. It's hard to align that world with my experience of copper mining communities in Arizona.\nFinally I am left with the uneasy feeling that the investigative limits Ms. Kingsolver set on her subject became dramatic limitations - by focusing her narrative so specifically, possibilities for contrast and distinction were lost. Too much was reduced to mere statement, whether by the author herself or by her informants, too much assumed. There is a good story here, but it is a story that could be enriched by placing it within a broader context.\nReturn to the Books Home Page\n|\n|\nHome | Site Index | Site Search | Forums | Archives | Marketplace\nQuick News | Page One Plus | International | National/N.Y. | Business | Technology | Science | Sports | Weather | Editorial | Op-Ed | Arts | Automobiles | Books | Diversions | Job Market | Real Estate | Travel\nHelp/Feedback | Classifieds | Services | New York Today\nCopyright 1998 The New York Times Company", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It just had to wait. It\u2019s still waiting.\nIn the uncertain years after Mao\u2019s death, long before China became an industrial juggernaut, before the Communist Party went on a winning streak that would reshape the world, a group of economics students gathered at a mountain retreat outside Shanghai. There, in the bamboo forests of Moganshan, the young scholars grappled with a pressing question: How could China catch up with the West?\nIt was the autumn of 1984, and on the other side of the world, Ronald Reagan was promising \u201cmorning again in America.\u201d China, meanwhile, was just recovering from decades of political and economic turmoil. There had been progress in the countryside, but more than three-quarters of the population still lived in extreme poverty. The state decided where everyone worked, what every factory made and how much everything cost.\nThe students and researchers attending the Academic Symposium of Middle-Aged and Young Economists wanted to unleash market forces but worried about crashing the economy \u2014 and alarming the party bureaucrats and ideologues who controlled it.\nLate one night, they reached a consensus: Factories should meet state quotas but sell anything extra they made at any price they chose. It was a clever, quietly radical proposal to undercut the planned economy \u2014 and it intrigued a young party official in the room who had no background in economics. \u201cAs they were discussing the problem, I didn\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d recalled Xu Jing\u2019an, now 76 and retired. \u201cI was thinking, how do we make this work?\u201d\nThe Chinese economy has grown so fast for so long now that it is easy to forget how unlikely its metamorphosis into a global powerhouse was, how much of its ascent was improvised and born of desperation. The proposal that Mr. Xu took from the mountain retreat, soon adopted as government policy, was a pivotal early step in this astounding transformation.\nChina now leads the world in the number of homeowners, internet users, college graduates and, by some counts, billionaires. Extreme poverty has fallen to less than 1 percent. An isolated, impoverished backwater has evolved into the most significant rival to the United States since the fall of the Soviet Union.\nAn epochal contest is underway. With President Xi Jinping pushing a more assertive agenda overseas and tightening controls at home, the Trump administration has launched a trade war and is gearing up for what could be a new Cold War. Meanwhile, in Beijing the question these days is less how to catch up with the West than how to pull ahead \u2014 and how to do so in a new era of American hostility.\nThe pattern is familiar to historians, a rising power challenging an established one, with a familiar complication: For decades, the United States encouraged and aided China\u2019s rise, working with its leaders and its people to build the most important economic partnership in the world, one that has lifted both nations.\nDuring this time, eight American presidents assumed, or hoped, that China would eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization: Prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring China into the fold of democratic nations. Or the Chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot.\nBut neither happened. Instead, China\u2019s Communist leaders have defied expectations again and again. They embraced capitalism even as they continued to call themselves Marxists. They used repression to maintain power but without stifling entrepreneurship or innovation. Surrounded by foes and rivals, they avoided war, with one brief exception, even as they fanned nationalist sentiment at home. And they presided over 40 years of uninterrupted growth, often with unorthodox policies the textbooks said would fail.\nIn late September, the People\u2019s Republic of China marked a milestone, surpassing the Soviet Union in longevity. Days later, it celebrated a record 69 years of Communist rule. And China may be just hitting its stride \u2014 a new superpower with an economy on track to become not just the world\u2019s largest but, quite soon, the largest by a wide margin.\nThe world thought it could change China, and in many ways it has. But China\u2019s success has been so spectacular that it has just as often changed the world \u2014 and the American understanding of how the world works.\nThere is no simple explanation for how China\u2019s leaders pulled this off. There was foresight and luck, skill and violent resolve, but perhaps most important was the fear \u2014 a sense of crisis among Mao\u2019s successors that they never shook, and that intensified after the Tiananmen Square massacre and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nEven as they put the disasters of Mao\u2019s rule behind them, China\u2019s Communists studied and obsessed over the fate of their old ideological allies in Moscow, determined to learn from their mistakes. They drew two lessons: The party needed to embrace \u201creform\u201d to survive \u2014 but \u201creform\u201d must never include democratization.\nChina has veered between these competing impulses ever since, between opening up and clamping down, between experimenting with change and resisting it, always pulling back before going too far in either direction for fear of running aground.\nMany people said that the party would fail, that this tension between openness and repression would be too much for a nation as big as China to sustain. But it may be precisely why China soared.\nWhether it can continue to do so with the United States trying to stop it is another question entirely.\nApparatchiks Into Capitalists\nNone of the participants at the Moganshan conference could have predicted how China would take off, much less the roles they would play in the boom ahead. They had come of age in an era of tumult, almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world, with little to prepare them for the challenge they faced. To succeed, the party had to both reinvent its ideology and reprogram its best and brightest to carry it out.\nMr. Xu, for example, had graduated with a degree in journalism on the eve of Mao\u2019s violent Cultural Revolution, during which millions of people were purged, persecuted and killed. He spent those years at a \u201ccadre school\u201d doing manual labor and teaching Marxism in an army unit. After Mao\u2019s death, he was assigned to a state research institute tasked with fixing the economy. His first job was figuring out how to give factories more power to make decisions, a subject he knew almost nothing about. Yet he went on to a distinguished career as an economic policymaker, helping launch China\u2019s first stock market in Shenzhen.\nAmong the other young participants in Moganshan were Zhou Xiaochuan, who would later lead China\u2019s central bank for 15 years; Lou Jiwei, who ran China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and recently stepped down as finance minister; and an agricultural policy specialist named Wang Qishan, who rose higher than any of them.\nMr. Wang headed China\u2019s first investment bank and helped steer the nation through the Asian financial crisis. As Beijing\u2019s mayor, he hosted the 2008 Olympics. Then he oversaw the party\u2019s recent high-stakes crackdown on corruption. Now he is China\u2019s vice president, second in authority only to Xi Jinping, the party\u2019s leader.\nThe careers of these men from Moganshan highlight an important aspect of China\u2019s success: It turned its apparatchiks into capitalists.\nBureaucrats who were once obstacles to growth became engines of growth. Officials devoted to class warfare and price controls began chasing investment and promoting private enterprise. Every day now, the leader of a Chinese district, city or province makes a pitch like the one Yan Chaojun made at a business forum in September.\n\u201cSanya,\u201d Mr. Yan said, referring to the southern resort town he leads, \u201cmust be a good butler, nanny, driver and cleaning person for businesses, and welcome investment from foreign companies.\u201d\nIt was a remarkable act of reinvention, one that eluded the Soviets. In both China and the Soviet Union, vast Stalinist bureaucracies had smothered economic growth, with officials who wielded unchecked power resisting change that threatened their privileges.\nMikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, tried to break the hold of these bureaucrats on the economy by opening up the political system. Decades later, Chinese officials still take classes on why that was a mistake. The party even produced a documentary series on the subject in 2006, distributing it on classified DVDs for officials at all levels to watch.\nAfraid to open up politically but unwilling to stand still, the party found another way. It moved gradually and followed the pattern of the compromise at Moganshan, which left the planned economy intact while allowing a market economy to flourish and outgrow it.\nParty leaders called this go-slow, experimental approach \u201ccrossing the river by feeling the stones\u201d \u2014 allowing farmers to grow and sell their own crops, for example, while retaining state ownership of the land; lifting investment restrictions in \u201cspecial economic zones,\u201d while leaving them in place in the rest of the country; or introducing privatization by selling only minority stakes in state firms at first.\n\u201cThere was resistance,\u201d Mr. Xu said. \u201cSatisfying the reformers and the opposition was an art.\u201d\nAmerican economists were skeptical. Market forces needed to be introduced quickly, they argued; otherwise, the bureaucracy would mobilize to block necessary changes. After a visit to China in 1988, the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman called the party\u2019s strategy \u201can open invitation to corruption and inefficiency.\u201d\nBut China had a strange advantage in battling bureaucratic resistance. The nation\u2019s long economic boom followed one of the darkest chapters of its history, the Cultural Revolution, which decimated the party apparatus and left it in shambles. In effect, autocratic excess set the stage for Mao\u2019s eventual successor, Deng Xiaoping, to lead the party in a radically more open direction.\nThat included sending generations of young party officials to the United States and elsewhere to study how modern economies worked. Sometimes they enrolled in universities, sometimes they found jobs, and sometimes they went on brief \u201cstudy tours.\u201d When they returned, the party promoted their careers and arranged for others to learn from them.\nAt the same time, the party invested in education, expanding access to schools and universities, and all but eliminating illiteracy. Many critics focus on the weaknesses of the Chinese system \u2014 the emphasis on tests and memorization, the political constraints, the discrimination against rural students. But mainland China now produces more graduates in science and engineering every year than the United States, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan combined.\nIn cities like Shanghai, Chinese schoolchildren outperform peers around the world. For many parents, though, even that is not enough. Because of new wealth, a traditional emphasis on education as a path to social mobility and the state\u2019s hypercompetitive college entrance exam, most students also enroll in after-school tutoring programs \u2014 a market worth $125 billion, according to one study, or as much as half the government\u2019s annual military budget.\nAnother explanation for the party\u2019s transformation lies in bureaucratic mechanics. Analysts sometimes say that China embraced economic reform while resisting political reform. But in reality, the party made changes after Mao\u2019s death that fell short of free elections or independent courts yet were nevertheless significant.\nThe party introduced term limits and mandatory retirement ages, for example, making it easier to flush out incompetent officials. And it revamped the internal report cards it used to evaluate local leaders for promotions and bonuses, focusing them almost exclusively on concrete economic targets.\nThese seemingly minor adjustments had an outsize impact, injecting a dose of accountability \u2014 and competition \u2014 into the political system, said Yuen Yuen Ang, a political scientist at the University of Michigan. \u201cChina created a unique hybrid,\u201d she said, \u201can autocracy with democratic characteristics.\u201d\nAs the economy flourished, officials with a single-minded focus on growth often ignored widespread pollution, violations of labor standards, and tainted food and medical supplies. They were rewarded with soaring tax revenues and opportunities to enrich their friends, their relatives and themselves. A wave of officials abandoned the state and went into business. Over time, the party elite amassed great wealth, which cemented its support for the privatization of much of the economy it once controlled.\nThe private sector now produces more than 60 percent of the nation\u2019s economic output, employs over 80 percent of workers in cities and towns, and generates 90 percent of new jobs, a senior official said in a speech last year. As often as not, the bureaucrats stay out of the way.\n\u201cI basically don\u2019t see them even once a year,\u201d said James Ni, chairman and founder of Mlily, a mattress manufacturer in eastern China. \u201cI\u2019m creating jobs, generating tax revenue. Why should they bother me?\u201d\nIn recent years, President Xi has sought to assert the party\u2019s authority inside private firms. He has also bolstered state-owned enterprises with subsidies while preserving barriers to foreign competition. And he has endorsed demands that American companies surrender technology in exchange for market access.\nIn doing so, he is betting that the Chinese state has changed so much that it should play a leading role in the economy \u2014 that it can build and run \u201cnational champions\u201d capable of outcompeting the United States for control of the high-tech industries of the future. But he has also provoked a backlash in Washington.\n\u2018Opening Up\u2019\nIn December, the Communist Party will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the \u201creform and opening up\u201d policies that transformed China. The triumphant propaganda has already begun, with Mr. Xi putting himself front and center, as if taking a victory lap for the nation.\nHe is the party\u2019s most powerful leader since Deng and the son of a senior official who served Deng, but even as he wraps himself in Deng\u2019s legacy, Mr. Xi has set himself apart in an important way: Deng encouraged the party to seek help and expertise overseas, but Mr. Xi preaches self-reliance and warns of the threats posed by \u201chostile foreign forces.\u201d\nIn other words, he appears to have less use for the \u201copening up\u201d part of Deng\u2019s slogan.\nOf the many risks that the party took in its pursuit of growth, perhaps the biggest was letting in foreign investment, trade and ideas. It was an exceptional gamble by a country once as isolated as North Korea is today, and it paid off in an exceptional way: China tapped into a wave of globalization sweeping the world and emerged as the world\u2019s factory. China\u2019s embrace of the internet, within limits, helped make it a leader in technology. And foreign advice helped China reshape its banks, build a legal system and create modern corporations.\nThe party prefers a different narrative these days, presenting the economic boom as \u201cgrown out of the soil of China\u201d and primarily the result of its leadership. But this obscures one of the great ironies of China\u2019s rise \u2014 that Beijing\u2019s former enemies helped make it possible.\nThe United States and Japan, both routinely vilified by party propagandists, became major trading partners and were important sources of aid, investment and expertise. The real game changers, though, were people like Tony Lin, a factory manager who made his first trip to the mainland in 1988.\nMr. Lin was born and raised in Taiwan, the self-governing island where those who lost the Chinese civil war fled after the Communist Revolution. As a schoolboy, he was taught that mainland China was the enemy.\nBut in the late 1980s, the sneaker factory he managed in central Taiwan was having trouble finding workers, and its biggest customer, Nike, suggested moving some production to China. Mr. Lin set aside his fears and made the trip. What he found surprised him: a large and willing work force, and officials so eager for capital and know-how that they offered the use of a state factory free and a five-year break on taxes.\nMr. Lin spent the next decade shuttling to and from southern China, spending months at a time there and returning home only for short breaks to see his wife and children. He built and ran five sneaker factories, including Nike\u2019s largest Chinese supplier.\n\u201cChina\u2019s policies were tremendous,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey were like a sponge absorbing water, money, technology, everything.\u201d\nMr. Lin was part of a torrent of investment from ethnic Chinese enclaves in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and beyond that washed over China \u2014 and gave it a leg up on other developing countries. Without this diaspora, some economists argue, the mainland\u2019s transformation might have stalled at the level of a country like Indonesia or Mexico.\nThe timing worked out for China, which opened up just as Taiwan was outgrowing its place in the global manufacturing chain. China benefited from Taiwan\u2019s money, but also its managerial experience, technology and relationships with customers around the world. In effect, Taiwan jump-started capitalism in China and plugged it into the global economy.\nBefore long, the government in Taiwan began to worry about relying so much on its onetime enemy and tried to shift investment elsewhere. But the mainland was too cheap, too close and, with a common language and heritage, too familiar. Mr. Lin tried opening factories in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia but always came back to China.\nNow Taiwan finds itself increasingly dependent on a much more powerful China, which is pushing ever harder for unification, and the island\u2019s future is uncertain.\nThere are echoes of Taiwan\u2019s predicament around the world, where many are having second thoughts about how they rushed to embrace Beijing with trade and investment.\nThe remorse may be strongest in the United States, which brought China into the World Trade Organization, became China\u2019s largest customer and now accuses it of large-scale theft of technology \u2014 what one official called \u201cthe greatest transfer of wealth in history.\u201d\nMany in Washington predicted that trade would bring political change. It did, but not in China. \u201cOpening up\u201d ended up strengthening the party\u2019s hold on power rather than weakening it. The shock of China\u2019s rise as an export colossus, however, was felt in factory towns around the world.\nIn the United States, economists say at least two million jobs disappeared as a result, many in districts that ended up voting for President Trump.\nSelective Repression\nOver lunch at a luxurious private club on the 50th floor of an apartment tower in central Beijing, one of China\u2019s most successful real estate tycoons explained why he had left his job at a government research center after the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square.\n\u201cIt was very easy,\u201d said Feng Lun, the chairman of Vantone Holdings, which manages a multibillion-dollar portfolio of properties around the world. \u201cOne day, I woke up and everyone had run away. So I ran, too.\u201d\nUntil the soldiers opened fire, he said, he had planned to spend his entire career in the civil service. Instead, as the party was pushing out those who had sympathized with the students, he joined the exodus of officials who started over as entrepreneurs in the 1990s.\n\u201cAt the time, if you held a meeting and told us to go into business, we wouldn\u2019t have gone,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo this incident, it unintentionally planted seeds in the market economy.\u201d\nSuch has been the seesaw pattern of the party\u2019s success.\nThe pro-democracy movement in 1989 was the closest the party ever came to political liberalization after Mao\u2019s death, and the crackdown that followed was the furthest it went in the other direction, toward repression and control. After the massacre, the economy stalled and retrenchment seemed certain. Yet three years later, Deng used a tour of southern China to wrestle the party back to \u201creform and opening up\u201d once more.\nMany who had left the government, like Mr. Feng, suddenly found themselves leading the nation\u2019s transformation from the outside, as its first generation of private entrepreneurs.\nNow Mr. Xi is steering the party toward repression again, tightening its grip on society, concentrating power in his own hands and setting himself up to rule for life by abolishing the presidential term limit. Will the party loosen up again, as it did a few years after Tiananmen, or is this a more permanent shift? If it is, what will it mean for the Chinese economic miracle?\nThe fear is that Mr. Xi is attempting to rewrite the recipe behind China\u2019s rise, replacing selective repression with something more severe.\nThe party has always been vigilant about crushing potential threats \u2014 a fledgling opposition party, a popular spiritual movement, even a dissident writer awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. But with some big exceptions, it has also generally retreated from people\u2019s personal lives and given them enough freedom to keep the economy growing.\nThe internet is an example of how it has benefited by striking a balance. The party let the nation go online with barely an inkling of what that might mean, then reaped the economic benefits while controlling the spread of information that could hurt it.\nIn 2011, it confronted a crisis. After a high-speed train crash in eastern China, more than 30 million messages criticizing the party\u2019s handling of the fatal accident flooded social media \u2014 faster than censors could screen them.\nPanicked officials considered shutting down the most popular service, Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, but the authorities were afraid of how the public would respond. In the end, they let Weibo stay open but invested much more in tightening controls and ordered companies to do the same.\nThe compromise worked. Now, many companies assign hundreds of employees to censorship duties \u2014 and China has become a giant on the global internet landscape.\n\u201cThe cost of censorship is quite limited compared to the great value created by the internet,\u201d said Chen Tong, an industry pioneer. \u201cWe still get the information we need for economic progress.\u201d\nA \u2018New Era\u2019\nChina is not the only country that has squared the demands of authoritarian rule with the needs of free markets. But it has done so for longer, at greater scale and with more convincing results than any other.\nThe question now is whether it can sustain this model with the United States as an adversary rather than a partner.\nThe trade war has only just begun. And it is not just a trade war. American warships and planes are challenging Chinese claims to disputed waters with increasing frequency even as China keeps ratcheting up military spending. And Washington is maneuvering to counter Beijing\u2019s growing influence around the world, warning that a Chinese spending spree on global infrastructure comes with strings attached.\nThe two nations may yet reach some accommodation. But both left and right in America have portrayed China as the champion of an alternative global order, one that embraces autocratic values and undermines fair competition. It is a rare consensus for the United States, which is deeply divided about so much else, including how it has wielded power abroad in recent decades \u2014 and how it should do so now.\nMr. Xi, on the other hand, has shown no sign of abandoning what he calls \u201cthe great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\u201d Some in his corner have been itching to take on the United States since the 2008 financial crisis and see the Trump administration\u2019s policies as proof of what they have always suspected \u2014 that America is determined to keep China down.\nAt the same time, there is also widespread anxiety over the new acrimony, because the United States has long inspired admiration and envy in China, and because of a gnawing sense that the party\u2019s formula for success may be faltering.\nProsperity has brought rising expectations in China; the public wants more than just economic growth. It wants cleaner air, safer food and medicine, better health care and schools, less corruption and greater equality. The party is struggling to deliver, and tweaks to the report cards it uses to measure the performance of officials hardly seem enough.\n\u201cThe basic problem is, who is growth for?\u201d said Mr. Xu, the retired official who wrote the Moganshan report. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved this problem.\u201d\nGrowth has begun to slow, which may be better for the economy in the long term but could shake public confidence. The party is investing ever more in censorship to control discussion of the challenges the nation faces: widening inequality, dangerous debt levels, an aging population.\nMr. Xi himself has acknowledged that the party must adapt, declaring that the nation is entering a \u201cnew era\u201d requiring new methods. But his prescription has largely been a throwback to repression, including vast internment camps targeting Muslim ethnic minorities. \u201cOpening up\u201d has been replaced by an outward push, with huge loans that critics describe as predatory and other efforts to gain influence \u2014 or interfere \u2014 in the politics of other countries. At home, experimentation is out while political orthodoxy and discipline are in.\nIn effect, Mr. Xi seems to believe that China has been so successful that the party can return to a more conventional authoritarian posture \u2014 and that to survive and surpass the United States it must.\nCertainly, the momentum is still with the party. Over the past four decades, economic growth in China has been 10 times faster than in the United States, and it is still more than twice as fast. The party appears to enjoy broad public support, and many around the world are convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s America is in retreat while China\u2019s moment is just beginning.\nThen again, China has a way of defying expectations.\nPhilip P.

In Britain, with its long and decorous literary tradition, his voice stands out discordantly from the rest like a boom box at a harpsichord recital. His urban satires have provoked extreme reactions in Britain, none more so than his latest, most ambitious novel, ''London Fields.'' Although mysteriously absent from this year's nominations for the Booker Prize, England's most prestigious literary award, the book is in the midst of a long run near the top of the best-seller list and has triggered phenomenal media attention. In recent years, Amis has become an outright literary star - an anomaly in Britain. But then, his prose is probably more American than British in its energy and raucousness. For many critics, Amis's comic talent is unrivaled, but for others, mostly older and conservative readers, he is a malevolent harpie, with morbid, vaguely unpatriotic interests. Intriguingly, his father is Kingsley Amis, one of Britain's original Angry Young Men of the 1950's, now a Thatcherite Conservative. Martin sees a fouler England than his father does.\n''London is a pub,'' he declares, looking disgustedly out of his study window into the gray street below. ''Not the pub with the jolly butcher and the smiling grannies; it's the pub of eight or nine alcoholics, a handful of hustlers and nutcases and a few token regular people. It's a stew,'' he declares. ''The whole idea of the pub as a place for the working man has vanished. Who's working? Now the pub is where you go all day. We're in a gentle, deep decline,'' he says quietly. ''Not as frenzied as America's, but perhaps even more poignant, more tragic.''\nShoppers at London's chic Burlington Arcade or tourists queueing for tickets to the latest Andrew Lloyd-Webber extravaganza may disagree with him; the British look richer than they did a decade ago. BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes jam the bus lanes, the Royal Family soap opera is better than ever, and Thatcher's Government is enjoying its 10th consecutive year of Tory rule. On the surface, all looks well indeed, and for many it is. As in most things English, London's malaise is subtle, and class-inflected. ''London Fields'' - to be published in America next month - floodlights the sagging underbelly of Thatcherite consumerism.\nNow 40 years old, Amis has written six novels, a collection of short stories and another of articles. Where his early, more self-gratifying novels were a pungent brew of sex, drugs and murder, his recent work (fiction and nonfiction) has ambitiously opened out into junk culture, nuclear weapons, America, and now the destruction of the environment. He traces his characters' destructive behavior to the overwhelming shadow of the bomb. Says a jaded character in ''London Fields'': ''If at any moment nothing might matter, then who says nothing didn't matter already?''\nTalking politics with Amis, it's easy to forget that he is a satirical writer; his pitch-black humor springs from a bristling arsenal of outrage, despair and fear. ''If you laugh at it, it evens things out, makes it easier to live with,'' he says. Amis's laughter is vengeful; vigilante humor.\nHis last few novels have buried the myth of a decent, gentle, pastoral England, paving over the site with cement-hard observations of a seedy, queasy new Britain, part strip-joint, part Buckingham Palace. If 10 years of Thatcherism have materially bolstered Britain, there is a grudging national consensus that prosperity has hardened her spirit. Amis's mean London streets are litter-strewn, vandalized; morality is nudged toward bankruptcy by ''market forces.'' His characters are close to the edge, more like New Yorkers than traditionally stoic Londoners. Amis's sharp social ear prompts some comparison with Tom Wolfe, but he's more literary, idiosyncratic, closer to Nabokov in his primary, sensuous delight in language. ''London Fields'' is not a chronicle of London in the way that Wolfe's ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' is a tale of New York; Amis's is a more personal, oblique urban vision. Plot is always subordinate to language in his fiction, to the frustration of some readers. Even aficionados find his work nearly unreadable in places, and routinely painful. He demands absolute unsqueamishness as far as expletives, body secretions, psychological cruelty and even sadism are concerned. He has an extortionist's talent for knowing people's secret fears, creating a climate of danger and paranoia. ''London Fields'' is a meditation on the millennium - disguised as a murder mystery. Narrated by a young American writer living in the trendy West London neighborhood of Notting Hill Gate, most of Amis's tragicomedy of sleaze and death takes place in a sinister pub called the Black Cross, a locale that epitomizes the squalor hidden behind London's posh facade.\nBritish novelists, from Iris Murdoch to David Lodge, have closed ranks against the new unpleasantness, ignored its consequences and settled in marginal enclaves of finer sensibility. With few exceptions, British fiction reflects the sovereignty of cozy, self-examining middle-class life: second-marriage angst, dinner-party betrayals, university-tenure feuds. Where his colleagues' writing is spare and cerebral, Amis is an unabashed maximalist: his work is refreshingly emotional, even carnal. He feels that ''good readers'' don't want to be shielded. ''My stuff is fairly sentimental; it's a lot worse out there,'' he says sadly.\nI SPENT SOME TIME with Amis not long after he had finished his new novel. We met several times in his bachelorish writing flat in Westbourne Park, a bleak outpost of Notting Hill Gate. He explained apologetically that his wife did not allow interviewers in the house, a mile away.\nAmis opened the front door of the forbidding Victorian rectory, greeting me with a sympathetic combination of professional wariness and animal curiosity. He has already been the subject of an extraordinary number of British interviews. Having read quite a few of them, I expected him to be small (around 5 feet 6) and clever, but what doesn't emerge from press clippings is his youthfulness, a quality of jaded teen-age swagger. The combination of his shortness and his bunchy, athletic build gives him the look of a boy-man. He wears nondescript clothes, except for a pair of raunchy black ankle boots with cowboy heels.\nIn the kitchen Amis clumsily made some tea, chatting companionably as he struggled with the kettle. His high, bulging forehead and single dark eyebrow give him a moody air even when he's laughing, and his deep-set eyes and pouting mouth are cold in repose. His treacle-brown hair, cut short, is thinning slightly. He has a powerful, attractive presence.\nThe first thing you notice in the flat is the pinball machine parked in the kitchen. Amis is a famous pinball nut. Perhaps he cultivates a bad-boy image to counter the seriousness and stridency of his writing. Altogether the flat resembles an all-male clubhouse, a sanctuary from grown-up pressure and parental taste. It's vaguely organized around typing and books, but the dart board, scruffy stereo, video and television set seem equally important. The odd children's book and woman's straw hat are the only jarring evidence of his family-man status.\nIn the newspaper-strewn study Amis spoke in a relaxed, candid way about his work. He was not the egomaniac that other journalists have described, but his self-assurance occasionally veered into profound self-satisfaction. He gives off complex signals; despite his worldly, wised-up manner Amis's natural curiosity makes him appear unexpectedly open and vulnerable, but also capable of sudden and vicious attack. His speech is enjoyably close to his narrative style - peppered with vivid adjectives and American slang, but the accent is standard Oxford issue. I ask him about his childhood. ''Childhood? What childhood?'' he exclaims. ''When Nabokov said a writer's childhood was his treasure chest, I thought, 'Christ, what do I do? I haven't got one.' '' He claims not to regret its absence.\nAmis's paternal grandfather was a mustard clerk from Clapham, and his mother's father was a suburban shoe millionaire. Kingsley Amis is twice divorced, and Martin's mother is on her third marriage; in a fairly bizarre family arrangement, Kingsley, now divorced from the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, lives as a lodger with Martin's mother and her third husband.\nMartin was the middle child of three, including an older brother, Philip, now a graphic designer, and a younger sister, Sally. ''I was the steady one.'' Amis attended approximately 14 different schools during the 1950's and 60's, due to the great success of his father's masterly picaresque novel ''Lucky Jim,'' which swept Kingsley broadly around the university circuit, including a year at Princeton, which introduced Martin to America.\nThe home atmosphere was permissive. ''Something out of early Updike, 'Couples' flirtations and a fair amount of drinking. They were all 'at it.' '' Amis speaks of his mother, Hilly, adoringly, stressing that her generous philosophy influenced him as strongly as his father's humor. He was devastated, at 12, by his parents' divorce.\n''I had a passionate street life; going to pubs and betting shops, smoking dope a bit. My parents were lax about girls, too,'' he remembers happily. He mainly read comic books until his stepmother, the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, urged Jane Austen upon him. He was a mod, briefly (''too many scooter crashes''), and then a hippie (''flowered shirt, velvet suit, far more relaxing''). But it was all a pose, he admits. He reformed academically before too much damage had been done, and went off abruptly to Oxford, where he earned a first-class degree from Exeter College.\nA seemingly effortless journalistic-literary career followed: entry-level job at The Times Literary Supplement; literary editor of The New Statesman at 27; feature writer for The Observer, author of sensationally reviewed novels at roughly two-year intervals. Writing seemed a natural path for Amis, growing up in a literary household. He was 20 when he began, but Kingsley famously displayed negligible interest in his son's work. Martin's reputation may now supersede his father's: an uncomfortable but not an acrimonious situation, both claim. Their ''rivalry'' is of such interest in Britain that when the National Portrait Gallery invited father and son to pose together for a double portrait, Kingsley's touchy refusal made the front page of The Sunday Telegraph. According to Martin, his father later regretted the fuss. Their relationship is unusually close - they even kiss cheeks un-Englishly, upon greeting - but they disagree about virtually everything: politics, people, literature. ''Several times he has even dumped on me in print,'' Martin laughs smartingly. His fondness for his father is such that he has never publicly retaliated, nor objected to Kingsley's opinions of his work. Martin takes it sadly, makes light of it. Apparently, Kingsley liked the beginning of his son's last novel, ''Money,'' a hectic tour of lowlife New York, London and Los Angeles, but didn't finish it. ''I can point out the exact place where he stopped and sent the book twirling through the air; that's where the character named Martin Amis comes in. 'Breaking the rules, buggering about with the reader, drawing attention to himself,' '' Martin says wearily, reciting his father's litany of complaints.\nThe novelist Julian Barnes explains: ''They do love one another. That established, Kingsley feels that he doesn't have to hold back in any other area, so he makes no pretense. Scandalously, I think, when it comes to the press. For Martin, it's a hurt that will never go away. The good side is, it's acted as a form of vaccination for Martin. If his father, whom he loves, dislikes his books, then it really doesn't matter what any critics say.''\nI spoke to Kingsley Amis on the phone at home in North London. Reworking a new novel, he seemed glad to break and talk about Martin. He spoke gruffly, and with an enormous fondness that he occasionally sacrificed for a good cutting remark. He began cautiously: ''I think that if anyone's reading us both in fifty or a hundred years' time, we shall seem like very much the same kind of writer. We're more similar than we seem in some ways; we have a similar sense of verbal, spoken humor. We compete with each other on that, always have, in a family-joke way.''\nOne of Kingsley's main reservations is Martin's constant surveillance of his characters' bedrooms and bathrooms, which he feels is misguided and ''in poor taste.'' He modifies: ''Sex is a fascinating area, but it's harder than he thinks. Nobody says that fiction should be able to discuss everything; he thinks he can do it, but I wonder if he can.'' Kingsley Amis is upset when accused of being hard on his son. ''To be 'hard' on someone is to be unfair, inappropriate. What I would describe is a strong, even furious opposition of views.'' He pauses. ''I'd like to say this about him: I admire him very much as a man. He's responsible, and above all sane. I like sanity.'' And Martin's political views? ''They're a lot of dangerous, howling nonsense,'' he thunders, ''but apart from that I regard him as one of my best and closest friends.'' He's explosive on Martin's view of Thatcher: ''If London has gotten more dirty and squalid and violent in Thatcher's day, she hasn't done that - I think it would be much worse without her. Anyone with Martin's income has no right to complain. I say that very, very loudly, and rather crossly.''\nAbruptly returning to writing, Amis says unexpectedly: ''But apart from Martin Amis, new British writers are disappointing. They should be doing what Martin's doing. When you get to be my age, a writer ought to be saying, 'Can't see what these young fellows are on about!' But with this lot, I can see only too well, and it's not very interesting. I'd rather read detective novels.''\nSaul Bellow is another admirer from the older generation. He's a sort of hero to the younger Amis, who quotes him both in his novels and in conversation. I spoke to Bellow on the phone in Chicago. He and Amis had met when Martin interviewed him several years ago, and a master-apprentice friendship was struck. Bellow was amiable, and charming. I asked him what he thought of Martin's controversial prose style.\n''There are two ways for fiction to go - one is to use an uncharged language which subordinates itself to the story and characters entirely, and the other is to use a charged language. Martin certainly uses a charged language. Anyone with that much of a feeling for words is bound to be accused of putting words first,'' he says equably. ''This was the case with Flaubert and Joyce, to begin with. Some critics felt that the poetry monopolized everything. I understand this intoxication with a new way of writing. The discovery is an overpowering one when it happens; you find you have a new way to write about modern life. And that's pretty heady.''\nDoes Bellow think that Martin Amis has the inventive genius of a Joyce or Flaubert? ''Yes, I do. I see signs of a very large outline.''\nONE DAY AMIS launches headlong into his pet topic, decline:\n''The 19th-century British novel was, if you like, a superpower novel. It was 800 pages long, about the whole of society. With decline, the novel has shrunk in confidence, in scope. In its current form, the typical English novel is 225 sanitized pages about the middle classes,'' he says. ''You know, 'well-made' with the nice color scheme and decor, and matching imagery. I almost try and avoid form. What I'm interested in is trying to get more truthful about what it's like to be alive now.''\nAmis bemoans the escapist, nostalgic leanings of the British toward their own country. He's bemused by foreigners' dated view of Britain as the land of tweedy aristocratic grandeur and dominance, the world of P. G. Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh. His own focus is the brash ascendancy of tabloid England, the downmarket world of Page Three pinups, Bingo greed and soap stars' abortions. He finds a rich source of comedy in contrasting the resentment-fueled economic rise of the working class against the slump of the largely ineffectual, burned-out upper class. ''Dead Babies,'' ''Success,'' ''Money'' and ''London Fields'' all feature bulldog-tenacious, kicked-around Cockneys barely triumphing over haughty, stunned aristocrats. Amis is sometimes criticized for caricaturing rather than characterizing his subjects, but he's quick to point out that he places no value judgments on his characters' actions (no matter how rotten); he's hardly a champion of the working classes, but he considers Thatcher's formula that money equals democracy ''facile.'' Unlike America, Britain has been a traditionally modest, even money-scorning culture, and its quick transition to a brass-knuckled state has been rather graceless, Amis feels, unaccompanied by inner generosity or fraternal spirit: ''I think Thatcher has done a lot of harm. The money age we're living through now is a short-term, futureless kind of prosperity that will last as long as there are public institutions to sell off, and as long as North Sea oil lasts. But it's really a 'live now, pay later' thing. Money is a more democratic medium than blood, but money as a cultural banner - you can feel the whole of society deteriorating around you because of that. Civility, civilization is falling apart.'' Keith Talent, the protagonist of ''London Fields,'' embodies the spirit of his age. A witless, wife-beating darts enthusiast, ''Keith cheated people with his limousine service at airports and train stations; he cheated people with his fake scents and colognes at the pavement stalls of Oxford Street and Bishopsgate . . . he cheated people with non-pornographic pornography in the back rooms of short-lease stores. . . . Keith earned three times as much as the Prime Minister and never had any money, losing heavily every day at the turf accountants on Portobello Road. . . . Sometimes he would ponder this on alternate Thursday lunchtimes, in his sheepskin overcoat, his head bent over the racing page, as he queued for his unemployment benefit. . . .''\nRolling himself a lumpy cigarette from a ratty-looking tobacco pouch, Amis readily talks about how the new book expresses his preoccupation with becoming middle-aged; it's a forced, angry farewell to selfish pleasures.\n''It's a little death, middle age. Romantic possibility . . . changes,'' he strains, looking a bit dreamy. ''It's calmer waters now, windless seas - if not the doldrums,'' he says, unable to squash a note of petulance in his voice. ''You always thought it was a hilarious secret that while everyone else got old, you weren't. But children redefine everything for you. A lot of the self is lost, thank God; the internal gibber of wants and need dies down,'' he lectures, not very convincingly.\nIn 1984, Amis married Antonia Phillips, a widowed Bostonian philosophy teacher. Without prompting, he goes over to his desk and with classic pride shows me a snapshot of his sons, Louis and Jacob (5 and 3), a couple of towheaded boys plying a pair of giant milkshakes. The sight cheers him. ''That's beer,'' he jokes.\nDespite being sidelined by married monogamy, Amis is still a keen observer of the sexual arena. His fascination with its dark side reaches a new low - or high, depending on one's taste - in ''London Fields.'' It's his blackest statement yet in a canon of black statements about sexual love. If his life has become G-rated, his work now earns an X. Amis insists that he uses sex as a vehicle for revealing characters ''when they're not just going through the motions.'' It's an area where need and greed converge, and where tenderness is accidental, a rare thrill.\nAmis's early notoriety as a famous (Continued on Page 48) writer's son, and later as a successful author in his own right, provoked mixed but intense attention well before the publication of ''London Fields.'' He says journalists' often hostile jabs don't affect him, but his sensitivity is obvious in his sneering, humorless television appearances and in the crucifying glares he gives to publicity photographers.\nHis open contempt for the press has fed his spoiled reputation. His arrogance so disgusted Private Eye that the paper referred to him for many years as ''Smarty Anus.'' The press has also resented his literary connections. From his father's milieu to his Oxford friends and premarital girlfriends, Amis's close contacts number practically the whole of ''quality'' British publishing, and an upmarket chunk of New York's as well. (He's associated with The Observer, Tatler, Granta, The New Statesman, Viking Penguin, Jonathan Cape, The Nation, Esquire, Vanity Fair, to name a few.) ''His mixture of precocity, great intelligence, and wide sexual success is bound to provoke envy,'' says Julian Barnes. ''People try to write like Martin. There's something very infectious and competitive about it.''\nUnlike many Englishmen, Amis doesn't apologize for his success. He now lives in a respectable family house in leafy Ladbroke Grove, but his work remains faithful to the esthetics of squalor. He's aware of leading something of a double life, and isn't completely comfortable with his new padding of wealth or the vantage de haut en bas. Never poor, Amis has become very well off. His advances have skyrocketed from a Dickensian $400 to a Hollywood-ish $150,000. According to friends, his wife, Antonia, is rich in her own right. Fame has not made him ''grand,'' as some claim, but ''busy,'' he corrects. His curtailed appearances on the London party circuit have given him a snobbish profile, but an old friend says: ''Martin's actually quite bad at parties, so he doesn't go to them anymore. He usually ends up talking to the waiter.''\nIn contrast to his allegedly wild younger days, Amis now leads a disciplined life. He breakfasts at 8:30 with the live-in nanny and children (his wife sleeps on), drives to the office via the boys' Montessori school, works until 2 or 3 (telephone off the hook). He is a serious tennis player; he drives to the Paddington Sports Club for his daily game. He is home by 6:15. When his wife attends the opera, Amis baby-sits, ''earning brownie points so I can play snooker later in the week. Marriage with children is all credit and debit, you know. My wife is a strong character, and I don't get away with much,'' he confesses. ''Some wives are rivals, muses, agents. My wife is just a wife. You don't get special treatment,'' he says in a rebuked tone. Amis is a hardened snooker addict. He joined a smart Pall Mall club not for prestige, he contends, but for its pool table. Sunday night is his regular snooker night.\nFOR OUR FINAL RENDEZVOUS, I accompanied Amis to a book party for environmental causes. He picked me up in a taxi around 6 P.M., clutching a furled copy of Tennis magazine. His hair neatly combed, he was dressed almost smartly in a Prince of Wales plaid suit and dark coat - his white shirt bore a prominent stain. It was a rare, beautifully clear evening, and Amis was in a relaxed mood. South Kensington's facades flowed regally past the taxi window, transformed by sunlight. Kensington Gardens were overflowing with fresh summer foliage. London looked startlingly clean.\nI asked Martin casually about his involvement with environmental issues. ''Paradise is a toilet!'' he exploded in a rehearsed way. ''It's as if the planet had aged four billion years in the last two centuries. If this had happened to a human being, you'd say, 'Jesus, what's he been up to? He looked like Apollo yesterday, now he looks like Methuselah!''\nSo is it all over? Is everything for sale? I asked at a traffic light.\n''The theme that the good is gone is as old as literature. Everything has been cheapened; the accumulation of experience is causing decay,'' Amis replied gravely, sounding like a skeptical dentist. And man's capacity to love? ''Romantic love will always be there, but it's harder for it to flourish. As Bellow says, ours is a sclerotic Eros. I think there's a lot of romanticism in my work'' - my eyebrows shot up involuntarily - ''but it's thwarted by distortion and perversity, false commercial images in TV, literature, porn. The fact is, my satire wouldn't work if what I'm satirizing were not valued. Like Philip Larkin's poetry, love is conspicuous by it's absence.''\nMartin Amis's instincts are chivalrous. By imagining the worst possible scenarios - addictiveness, child abuse, urban decay, nuclear holocaust - he seems to want to avert the impending disasters by giving us a test run, sending in his fictional characters to show the damage we'll run up. He knows he can't save anyone, but he wants us to see the danger and to experience fear squarely, not drunk on cheap deferral or delusion. But most of all he wants to deflate fear with laughter.\nHis prose style may shock, but the values behind it are surprisingly traditional: truth, love, compassion, integrity, family. ''But it's no fun to read about, and no fun to write.'' He grinned and climbed out of the taxi. Some photographers were waiting by the party entrance, and a television crew stood nervously by; Martin Amis stood tall and scowled for the cameras.\n|\n|\nHome |\nHelp/Feedback |\nClassifieds |\nServices |", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Bannon made a trip to the Connecticut country house of Henry A. Kissinger to talk about China.\nIt was more of a pilgrimage, actually: the prophet of disruption seeking out the high priest of geopolitics to make the case that Mr. Kissinger\u2019s view of America\u2019s relationship with China was hopelessly out of date. The two men talked for hours in the sunroom, and while they enjoyed each other\u2019s company, they did not, in the end, see eye to eye.\n\u201cHe agreed 100 percent with my analysis,\u201d Mr. Bannon recalled, \u201cbut he disagreed with my conclusions because they were too blunt force.\u201d\nMr. Kissinger confirmed this account, saying he told his visitor that the United States and China must strive for the \u201cpartial cooperation of countries that by normal standards might be considered enemies.\u201d\n\u201cHe has a different view,\u201d Mr. Kissinger added dryly.\nIn the four decades since the United States re-established diplomatic ties with China, Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Bannon can be seen as bookends.\nWith his secret trip to Beijing in 1971, Mr. Kissinger kicked off an era of engagement marked by the stubborn belief that bringing China out of its isolation through trade and investment would make America safer \u2014 and perhaps make China more like America. That era now seems to be ending, giving way to a more hostile one, with a trade war encouraged by Mr. Bannon and the ascendancy of his view that the United States must confront China while it still can.\nFrom the White House to the boardroom, from academia to the news media, American attitudes toward China have soured to an extent unseen since Mr. Kissinger\u2019s historic trip. China\u2019s rapid rise, and the acute sense of grievance and insecurity it has stirred in the United States, has led some to conclude, as the title of a recent book about the relationship suggested, that these two giants are \u201cdestined for war.\u201d\nThe United States and China, of course, have had their ups and downs ever since the 1780s, when New England brigs first sailed to China with beaver skins and silver coins, ushering in more than a century of exchanges that sent Christian missionaries to the Middle Kingdom and Chinese railroad workers to the Wild West.\nThe two nations fought as allies in World War II, then faced off as foes in the Cold War, before Richard M. Nixon rekindled relations with Beijing to isolate the Soviets. The hopes generated by Deng Xiaoping\u2019s economic opening in the 1980s were dashed by the Tiananmen Square massacre. The trade deals of the 1990s were strained when wayward American bombs destroyed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.\nFor at least a decade, Americans have blamed China for shuttered factories and jobless workers. Public views of China swung from positive to negative in 2012, according to Pew Global Research, and have remained underwater since. About 38 percent of Americans now view China favorably \u2014 down from 44 percent in 2017 \u2014 but that number is not markedly worse than it has been for the last half-decade.\nYet the current chill in the relationship seems different, less a temporary rupture than a searching reappraisal of what a status-quo superpower should do about an ambitious, formidable challenger.\nThe Trump administration has adopted a more confrontational stance but struggled to set clear goals and articulate a strategy for achieving them. To date, its efforts have been scattershot: trade tariffs that have rattled Beijing but also Wall Street, a foreign aid program dwarfed by China\u2019s enormous loans for infrastructure overseas, a warning against Chinese meddling in American elections without much evidence of such activity.\nThe White House is channeling antagonism that extends far beyond Washington. Business executives accuse China of stealing technology from their firms. College professors suspect that some of its exchange students are spies. Military officers see its warships advancing across the Pacific.\nMany Americans who embraced trade and cooperation with China had hoped that bringing it into the global economic order would, over time, pull its politics and society into a kind of convergence with the West. Yet China is heading in the opposite direction under the strongman rule of Xi Jinping, toward less political freedom and more state control of the economy \u2014 a surveillance state at home that nourishes imperial ambitions abroad. Far from modeling itself on the United States, China is presenting itself as a defiant alternative.\n\u201cIn our good-hearted way, we wanted to believe that with a few more cultural exchanges, a few more visiting ballet troupes, China would come around,\u201d said Orville H. Schell, the director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cBut Xi Jinping shut the door on that. He said, \u2018Not only are we not going there, but we have our own model now.\u2019 \u201d\nKevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and longtime observer of China, said the political and economic changes in China under Mr. Xi, and in the United States under Mr. Trump, had shattered the consensus in both nations about how to manage the relationship. That, Mr. Rudd said, portended an uncertain \u2014 and almost certainly more dangerous \u2014 future.\n\u201cYou can almost hear the ripping sound somewhere up the middle of the Pacific,\u201d Mr. Rudd said in an interview, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s put back together.\u201d\n\u2018Tacit Allies\u2019\nRealpolitik motivated Mr. Kissinger\u2019s outreach to China: He and Nixon saw it as a counterweight to the Soviet Union. But they were not immune to what an American diplomat, U. Alexis Johnson, called \u201crapturous enchantment.\u201d After a return trip to Beijing in 1973 to open a liaison office, a euphoric Mr. Kissinger wrote to Nixon, \u201cWe have now become tacit allies.\u201d\nIn the United States, China suddenly became cool. \u201cAmericans donned Mao jackets and Mao hats, stir-fried in woks, and wielded chopsticks,\u201d the journalist John Pomfret wrote in his 2016 book, \u201cThe Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom.\u201d Shortly after Nixon\u2019s landmark trip, the Chinese cut a $392 million deal with a Texas company to build 16 fertilizer plants in China, an early sign of engagement\u2019s bottom-line benefits.\nDiplomatic relations would ebb and flow, buffeted by domestic politics in both nations. But trade across the Pacific began a relentless upward march. Companies like IBM, Citibank and Jeep were entranced by the vastness of the Chinese market, and the pioneers of engagement marveled at how quickly commerce came to define the relationship.\nEven a devastating setback, the deadly crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, did not snuff out those ties. President George Bush, who once headed the United States liaison office in Beijing, secretly sent his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, to Beijing to keep the relationship from going off the rails.\nIn March 2000, after the United States opened the door to China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, Bill Clinton laid out the case for economic integration as the best way to bring freedom to the country. In one of the more forceful arguments for engagement made by an American president, he promised that W.T.O. membership would wean China off state-owned enterprises and open its society.\n\u201cThe more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people \u2014 their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when individuals have the power, not just to dream but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.\u201d\nMr. Clinton\u2019s view was widely shared at the time, and not without reason. Under President Jiang Zemin and his prime minister, Zhu Rongji, the Communist Party withdrew from large parts of the economy, encouraged private entrepreneurship and welcomed foreign investors.\nOver the decades, the United States and China built the mightiest commercial relationship in history: Trade between the two ballooned from $5 billion in 1980 to $231 billion in 2004. China soon became the manufacturer of choice for T-shirts and toys, laptops and television sets. General Motors, Motorola and other American companies that invested in China made healthy profits. To satisfy the American appetite for low-cost goods, China began exporting more to Walmart alone than it did to most entire nations.\nBy 2006, though, China\u2019s transition to market economics was slowing, and it began pursuing a policy of \u201cindigenous innovation,\u201d establishing targets to achieve dominance in high-tech industries that were traditionally the domain of the United States and Japan. By the time Barack Obama was elected, a narrative had taken hold in some quarters that letting China into the W.T.O. was a mistake.\nMr. Obama called out Beijing on the theft of American technology and intellectual property, and needled two of his advisers, Lawrence H. Summers and Jeffrey A. Bader, about their work in negotiating with China during the Clinton administration. \u201cDid you guys give away too much?\u201d he asked, according to Mr. Bader.\nPresident Trump has since turned Mr. Obama\u2019s private gibe into a political slogan. Letting China into the W.T.O., he argues, was the original sin of America\u2019s dealings with China \u2014 a defective agreement that gave the Chinese license to steal from American companies and siphon off American jobs.\nBut to Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative who ran the negotiations with Beijing in the 1990s, whether China should have been admitted is a \u201cnonsensical question.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was going to end up in the W.T.O.,\u201d she said.\nWith a fifth of the world\u2019s population, nuclear weapons, a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council and a track record of economic opening, China could not realistically be kept out, she argued. It already had significant access to the world\u2019s major economies, including the United States. If it did not join the W.T.O., it would have continued to reap the benefits without being forced to open its own markets.\n\u201cThe issue is, was it going to be a substantively, commercially significant deal?\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said. \u201cAnd I would argue that the proof is in the pudding.\u201d China, she noted, now imports more goods from the world than any country besides the United States.\nBut with every step China took to open its markets, it erected new barriers that hobbled foreign competitors and favored its own companies. The problem was not China\u2019s W.T.O. membership but the failure of American officials to use the tools in the agreement to force China\u2019s compliance with the terms, Ms. Barshefsky said.\n\u201cThe U.S. did the right thing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t continue to do the right thing.\u201d\n\u2018Economic Aggression\u2019\nPeter Navarro, the bomb-throwing economist who heads Mr. Trump\u2019s trade office, said he first noticed the corrosive impact China was having on the American economy in the early 2000s, when he was teaching evening classes at the University of California, Irvine.\nDuring the day, most of his students held down jobs. But Mr. Navarro recalled noticing that \u201cmy students were having more and more problems in the job market. It was a puzzle to me. I thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Navarro already suspected that jobs were moving to China because of its low labor costs. But after a year of research, he concluded there were four other factors at play: China\u2019s theft of American intellectual property, its subsidies for exporters, its currency manipulation and its dearth of environmental regulations.\n\u201cAll roads led to China,\u201d he said.\nThe economist remade himself into a China Cassandra, publishing books like \u201cThe Coming China Wars\u201d and \u201cDeath by China\u201d that put him on the radical fringe of his profession. But his views dovetailed with those of Mr. Trump, who had railed for decades against the unfair trade practices of China and, earlier, Japan.\nWhile the Japanese threat was overblown, there is little disagreement now that China contributed to the hollowing out of American manufacturing. Cheap Chinese clothing decimated textile jobs between 1973 and 2015. Chinese furniture makers wiped out their American counterparts. For blue-collar America, \u201cMade in China\u201d became synonymous with the ravages of globalization.\nNow ensconced in the White House, Mr. Navarro has supplied the intellectual grist for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. In June, his office published a report titled \u201cHow China\u2019s Economic Aggression Threatens the Technologies and Intellectual Property of the United States and the World,\u201d which accused China of preying on American companies in a variety of ways.\nOther economists still dismiss Mr. Navarro\u2019s prescription, which consists of piling on more tariffs until China agrees to fundamental changes. But privately, many businesspeople share his diagnosis. Their immediate concern is Made in China 2025, a state policy that seeks to dominate key industries by forcing American companies to hand over technology and assisting Chinese firms with subsidies.\nOccasionally, American frustrations with Chinese partners and competitors spill into the open. In July 2010, the then-chief executive of General Electric, Jeff Immelt, said at a private dinner, \u201cI am not sure that in the end they want any of us to win, or any of us to be successful.\u201d General Electric backpedaled furiously after his comments were reported. Despite their grievances, American business executives were still afraid of antagonizing the Chinese authorities, who could order raids on their operations.\nDoing business in China became even harder after the financial crisis of 2008. By that time, China had passed Japan to become America\u2019s largest creditor, holding about $600 billion of United States Treasury notes. Chinese officials were appalled by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and fearful of their own exposure. If they were always suspicious of American politicians, now they turned against their friends on Wall Street, too, taking a harder line in negotiations and rejecting their calls to open up the Chinese economy further.\n\u201cChinese officials began to dress down Americans and skip meetings,\u201d said James McGregor, the chairman of greater China for APCO Worldwide, who advises companies dealing with Chinese officials. \u201cFor the Chinese leadership, this was the emperor-had-no-clothes moment.\u201d\nStrategic Competition\nFor all of Mr. Obama\u2019s wariness on trade, he was as committed to engaging China as each of his predecessors going back to Nixon. He sought global issues, like climate change and nuclear nonproliferation, on which the United States and China could work together. But his strategy, known as the \u201cAsia pivot,\u201d also called for a greater American diplomatic and military presence in the region, to try to manage China\u2019s rise.\nThe Trump administration has rejected the Obama strategy, branding it na\u00efve and inadequate. It has adopted a more combative approach, formally designating China a \u201cstrategic competitor\u201d and \u201crevisionist power,\u201d one that is trying to rewrite the rules of the post-World War II order to match its own interests and ambitions. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides say that China has gotten away with too much for too long, and that only a show of American strength can force it to change its behavior.\nThe cornerstone of this policy has been the trade war, with new tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese exports in place and Mr. Trump threatening more. Yet the administration\u2019s objective is uncertain.\nMr. Trump has floated various demands that would be difficult to enforce or require a wholesale overhaul of the Chinese economy, including a sharp reduction in the trade deficit and an end to coercive technology transfers. Some trade and security hawks have urged \u201cdecoupling\u201d the United States entirely from the Chinese economy.\nThe Trump administration has taken a tougher approach outside trade as well. It has stepped up naval patrols in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, where the Chinese have been turning isolated spits of reef into military installations. But it has not laid out how the United States can stop a Chinese military buildup that is already tilting the balance of power in the region in Beijing\u2019s favor.\nThe Trump administration has also taken a harder line on economic espionage, indicting Chinese citizens accused of being intelligence agents, tightening controls on Chinese investment, and even considering a plan to restrict Chinese students from attending American universities.\nLeft unanswered has been a profound question: How can the United States compete by closing its doors when openness has been key to its success?\nVice President Mike Pence laid out the case for confrontation in a harshly worded speech last month that many interpreted as a call for a new Cold War, with the United States as defender of democracy and market competition and China as the champion of authoritarianism and state-led growth. But as he called for a sustained effort to counter Beijing, Mr. Pence made little effort to reach beyond America\u2019s partisan divide and rally the entire nation behind it.\n\u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he said, \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s leadership is working; and China wants a different American president.\u201d\nThe conflict with China is intensifying amid unresolved concerns about American leadership and overreach that built up during the era of globalization, and in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and other distant battlefields.\nIf anything, Mr. Trump has shown a desire to pull back from commitments around the world \u2014 a pattern, critics say, that has sundered trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and undermined America\u2019s allies, depriving the United States of one of its greatest advantages in a geopolitical competition.\nChina\u2019s own efforts to win friends and expand its influence, meanwhile, have brought mixed results so far. As part of its Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing has dangled billions of dollars for infrastructure projects in dozens of countries, from Malaysia to Kenya. The Trump administration has condemned the loans as predatory and is trying to put together its own competing aid program.\nMr. Trump\u2019s instincts about China are not easy to pigeonhole. He speaks often about his friendship with Mr. Xi and admiringly of China\u2019s economic success. His grievances are rooted in trade \u2014 in the conviction that China has been cheating the United States \u2014 rather than in Beijing\u2019s ambitions in Asia or its repressive political system.\nAmong his advisers, there is a wide disparity in how they view the coming contest. Some, like Mr. Navarro, cast it as an epic struggle over who will control the commanding heights of the 21st-century economy. Others, like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, have tried to put the brakes on Mr. Trump\u2019s most belligerent trade moves.\nThey feud constantly, and at times publicly, about who speaks for the president, leaving both Chinese officials and China experts in the United States confused about the direction of American policy.\nMr. Bannon, who says his views of China were formed as a young Navy officer in the Pacific in the 1970s, speaks in almost apocalyptic terms, foreseeing a clash of civilizations. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to be the Confucian, mercantilist model or the liberal democratic Western model handed down from Greece,\u201d he said.\nMatthew Pottinger, the senior director for Asia on the National Security Council, portrays it as more of a traditional, Cold War-style rivalry between superpowers with competing ideologies. He began his career as a foreign correspondent in China, where a state security officer once roughed him up.\n\u201cWe in the Trump administration have updated our China policy to bring the concept of competition to the forefront,\u201d Mr. Pottinger said recently at the Chinese Embassy in Washington. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s O.K. For us, in the United States, competition is not a four-letter word.\u201d\nThe trouble is, there has been very little public debate about any of this. What are the goals of America\u2019s competition with China: toppling the Communist regime or thwarting China\u2019s rise, as some in China have long suspected, or merely trying to modify its behavior? And in any case, how much are Americans willing to sacrifice for it?\nGraham Allison, a Harvard professor who worked in the Defense Department to reshape relations with former Soviet nations after the end of the last Cold War, argues that a rising power like China is likely to come to blows with an established one like the United States. In his book \u201cDestined for War,\u201d he describes a chilling scenario in which an accidental naval collision in the South China Sea escalates calamitously into a full-blown conflict.\nBut some China experts note that other areas of dispute, like Taiwan, have not become more fraught in recent years. And whatever the issue, they argue, a disastrous miscalculation is more likely without persistent engagement.\n\u201cAmericans need to understand that if we go down the road of disengagement from China in pursuit of unbridled competition, it will not be a repetition of the Cold War with the Soviet Union,\u201d said Mr. Bader, the former Obama adviser. \u201cThe rest of the world, like us, is deeply entangled with China.\u201d\nAs a result, he said, even countries as wary of China as the United States \u201cwill not risk economic ties nor join in a perverse struggle to re-erect the \u2018Bamboo Curtain,\u2019 this time by the West. We will be on our own.\u201d\nAt 95, Mr. Kissinger, not surprisingly, takes the long view. Together, he said, the United States and China exert such power, and are capable of inflicting such unthinkable destruction, that they owe it to the world to find a path toward \u201cpartial cooperation.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to make the effort of moving in that direction,\u201d he said.\nHarking back to his session with Mr. Bannon, Mr. Kissinger added, \u201cI cannot guarantee that that will be the result.\u201d\nMark Landler, a White House correspondent, was The Times\u2019s Hong Kong bureau chief from 1998 to 2002. He was the last American journalist to ask a question of President Xi Jinping, during his news conference with President Barack Obama in the Great Hall of the People in 2014.\nDesign: Matt Ruby, Rumsey Taylor, Quoctrung Bui Editing: Tess Felder, Eric Nagourney, David Schmidt Photo Editing: David Furst, Craig Allen, Meghan Petersen, Mikko Takkunen Illustrations: Sergio Pe\u00e7anha", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Sadat!\" tens of thousands of Cairenes chanted at the grinning figure in the open limousine. ''Sadat! The man of peace!'' It was the night of Nov. 21, 1977. President\nAnwar el-Sadat had just returned from his epochal journey to Jerusalem. Egypt's people were giving their frenzied approval to what his trip had achieved - an Egyptian-Israeli thaw that set the\nstage for the peace treaty of 1979.\nWhat made Mr. Sadat into such a catalytic force in Middle Eastern history was a display of courage and flexibility that transformed what had seemed to be an average Arab officer-turned-potentate.\nUnlike so many of his brother Arab leaders, he was willing to ignore past Arab-Israeli hatreds. Unlike them all, he was daring enough to do what had been unthinkable in the anguished world of Arab politics\n- to extend the hand of peace to the Israeli foe. Reversing Egypt's longstanding policy, he proclaimed his willingness to accept Israel's existence as a sovereign state.\nAdmiration and Hatred\nThen, where so many Middle East negotiators had failed, he succeeded, along with Presidents Carter and Reagan and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, in keeping the improbable rapprochement alive.\nIn the process he earned himself, in addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, the admiration of Americans, Israelis and other supporters of a Middle East settlement. But he also drew outpourings of hatred\nfrom Palestinians and other Arabs who felt he was a traitor to their struggles against Israel. And he was unable to quash dissidence in his impoverished, seething homeland.\nHe often said he wanted to bequeath democratic institutions to his people, but in recent weeks he staged a dictatorial crackdown on militant Moslems and Coptic Christians as well as secular political\nopponents. And he claimed imperially - but hollowly, as it turned out - to have put an end to ''lack of discipline in any way or form.''\nThe Treaty\nEleven days before Mr. Sadat made his trip to Jerusalem, he said in Cairo that he was willing to go to ''the ends of the earth,'' and even to the Israeli Parliament, in the cause\nof peace. The Israeli Government made known that he was welcome in Jerusalem, and after complex negotiations he flew there, although a state of war still existed between the two nations.\nHis eyes were moist and his lips taut with suppressed emotion as he arrived, but his Arabic was firm and resonant when, hours later, he told the hushed Israeli Parliament, ''If you want to\nlive with us in this part of the world, in sincerity I tell you that we welcome you among us with all security and safety.''\nPraising Mr. Sadat's initiative, Prime Minister Begin said, ''We, the Jews, know how to appreciate such courage.'' Mr. Sadat's flexibility, he said later, stemmed from his\nsolitary confinement as a political prisoner in cell 54 of Cairo Central Prison in 1947 and 1948. ''My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded place taught me that he who\ncannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality and will never, therefore, make any progress,'' he wrote in his memoirs, ''In Search of Identity,''\nwhich appeared in 1978, eight years after he assumed the Presidency.\nPact Signed at White House\nHis willingness to make such a change led to the treaty that, after many snags, he and Prime Minister Begin signed at the White House on March 26, 1979. Before reaching agreement Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin\nhad drawn-out and sometimes acrimonious negotiations, for which they were the joint winners of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.\nThe treaty provided that Israel return to Egypt in phases the entire Sinai Peninsula, which the Israelis seized in the 1967 war. It also envisioned internal autonomy for the Palestinian Arabs of the\nWest Bank of the Jordan River under continued Israeli control. The Egyptian and Israeli Governments were helped and prodded by the Nixon and Carter Administrations, and Henry A. Kissinger, after\nmany meetings with Mr. Sadat, wrote that the Egyptian leader ''possessed that combinat ion of insight and courage which marks a great statesman.'' The former Secretary of State\ncontinued in his book, ''White House Years'': ''He had the boldness to go to a war no one thought he could sustain; the moderation to move to peace immediately afterward;\nand the wisdom to reverse attitudes hardened by decades.''\nUsed Harmony as a Technique\nIn dealings with Israel and the United States, Mr. Sadat strove to create a harmonious mood that would make it difficult for others to disagree with him. His most audacious use of that technique was\nthe Jerusalem visit.\nThat gesture and the treaty with Israel brought him hatred and vituperation from many Arab leaders. There was particular outrage because the treaty did not provide a timetable for full self-determination\nfor the West Bank Palestinians that would lead eventually to an independent Palestinian state.\nSelf-determination was originally Mr. Sadat's minimum demand; when he settled for less, he found himself virtually isolated in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia's leaders, with whom he had achieved\nwarm relations, cut back their aid to the Egyptian armed forces and the economy, which Mr. Sadat had tried to strengthen by encouraging business.\nThe Saudi action made Egypt more dependent than ever on support from the United States, with which Mr. Sadat had also been careful to cultivate bonds of friendship. Under his predecessor, Gamal Abdel\nNasser, Cairo's relations with the Americans, as with the Saudis, were hostile much of the time. Mr. Sadat won moral and political support from Washington as well as large-scale economic and\nmilitary aid, and in 1975 he became the first Egyptian President to make a state visit to the United States. He returned again during the treaty negotiations, and President Carter went to Egypt,\nwhere throngs hailed him and his host.\nTreaty Welcomed by Egyptians\nMany of the 40 million Egyptians, having gone through four painful and expensive wars with Israel, were enthusiastic about the peace treaty. Throngs of well-wishers danced, waved signs and threw rose\npetals in celebration.\nUnder the treaty Israel's withdrawal of its civilian and military forces from Sinai was to be carried out in stages over three years. Two-thirds of the area was to be handed back within nine months\nafter the exchange of formal ratification documents. In return for the Israeli pullback, Mr. Sadat agreed to establish peace. After the nine-month withdrawal was finished, the two Governments were\nto take up ''normal and friendly relations'' in the diplomatic, economic and cultural spheres, among others. The early withdrawals were completed, and the final phase is scheduled\nfor next April.\n''This is certainly one of the happiest moments of my life,'' Mr. Sadat, deeply moved, said at the signing ceremony. ''In all the steps I took I was merely expressing the\nwill of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.''\nExpels Soviet Advisers\nAnother of Mr. Sadat's major shifts in policy was his departure from Nasser's longstanding pro-Soviet stance. In July 1972 he abruptly ordered the withdrawal of the 25,000 Soviet military specialists\nand advisers in Egypt. By so doing, he later wrote, ''I wanted to tell the whole world that we are always our own masters.''\nThe changes in the relationship with Washington and Moscow were made after Mr. Sadat had concluded that the Arabs could not achieve a satisfactory end to their confrontation with Israel as long as they\nwere allied closely with the Soviet Union while Israel had the all out support of the United States.\nHe was able to make such sharp policy shifts in part because for much of his later tenure as President, his power did not seem to be seriously challenged at home. A career officer and longtime confidant\nof Nasser, he was named Vice President in 1969, came out ahead in a brief power struggle after Nasser's death in 1970 and was formally made President by a rubber-stamp vote of members of the\nArab Socialist Union, the only legal political organization. He consolidated and enlarged his power in the spring of 1971 when, with the aid of the army, he forestalled what he said was a coup and\narrested his opponents.\nCalled Himself a Peasant\nMr. Sadat was widely though not universally popular with the Egyptian people, with whom, in his highly emotional way, he felt a warm and almost mystic bond. In ''In Search of Identity,''\nhe proudly called himself ''a peasant born and brought up on the banks of the Nile.''\nEarly in his presidency, Mr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by eliminating many of the police-state controls that Nasser had relied on to keep himself in power in the years after the officers' revolt\nthat brought down the monarchy in 1952.\nIn 1973 Mr. Sadat did much to build national self-respect when he ordered Egyptian troops to cross the Suez Canal; they managed to overrun the heavily fortified Israeli positions on the east bank within\na few hours. That confidence lingered although the Israelis counterattacked, putting a large tank force on the west bank.\nAs an administrator, he concerned himself with broad lines of policy and for the most part left it to his subordinates to carry it out. Though an emotional man, he could conceal his feelings and be devious.\nHe repeatedly lied his way out of trouble when he was a young officer plotting a military revolt, and as President he pulled off a master stroke of deception when he concealed his preparations for\nthe 1973 war, which began with a surprise attack on Israel.\nMr. Sadat had many quirks. He disliked offices and rarely appeared at Abdin Palace, Cairo's equivalent of the White House, preferring to work in his modest villa and in Government-owned rest houses\naround the country. He wore elegantly cut British-style suits, though even as President he liked to stroll around his native village in a long Arab shirt. He never learned to dance. He could be the\nhigh-toned statesman one minute, relishing his associations with other world leaders, and the humdrum homebody the next, always beginning the day with a dose of Eno's Fruit Salts, a British-made\naid to digestion.\nFirst Steps\nMohammed Anwar el-Sadat was born Dec. 25, 1918, in Mit Abul Kom, a cluster of mud-brick buildings in Minufiya Province between Cairo and Alexandria. He was one of the 13 children of Mohammed el-Sadat,\na Government clerk, and his part-Sudanese wife, a heritage manifest in the boy's skin, darker than the average Egyptian's.\nMinufiya lies in the fertile Nile Delta, its irrigated fields producing rich crops of flax and cotton. In those lush surroundings young Anwar's early years passed happily. He wrote later that he\nhad especially relished the sunrise hour ''when I went out with scores of boys and men, young and old, taking our cattle and beasts of burden to the fields.''\nHis first schooling was at the hands of a kindly Islamic cleric, Sheik Abdul-Hamid, who instilled in him a deep and lasting faith in Islam; as an adult Mr. Sadat bore a dark mark on his forehead, the\nresult of repeatedly touching his head to the floor in prayer.\nToo Poor to Buy Store Bread\nIn 1925 the father was transferred to Cairo, and the family moved into a small house on the outskirts of the capital, not far from Kubba Palace, one of the residences of Egyptian kings. Anwar gave early\nevidence of the audacity he repeatedly showed in later life, stealing apricots from the royal orchard.\nThough the elder Mr. Sadat rose to be a senior clerk, the family was poor, so poor that it could not afford to buy bakery bread. In his memoirs President Sadat said that his early experience of village\nlife, with its ''fraternity, cooperation and love,'' gave him the self-confidence to make his way in the big city, ''It deepened my feeling of inner superiority, a feeling\nwhich has never left me and which, I came to realize, is an inner power independent of all material resources.''\nIn time the proud schoolboy, like other idealistic Egyptians of his generation, came to have a burning political desire: he wanted his country freed of the control of Britain, which had maintained troops\nthere and exercised sway in other ways since the decline of Ottoman Turkish power late in the 19th century.\nWanting to play a role in Egypt's future, Mr. Sadat decided to become an officer. Despite his family's lack of influence, he managed to gain admission to the Royal Military Academy, which was\nonce a preserve of the aristocracy but had begun taking cadets from the middle and lower classes. Graduating in 1938, he was assigned to a signal corps installation near the capital. From that central\nlocation, as he later told it, he became active in the formation of an organization of officers who wanted to mount an armed revolt against the British presence.\nBritain as the Main Foe\nWhen World War II broke out, Captain Sadat continued to regard Britain as the main enemy and took part in a clandestine attempt to fly a former Chief of Staff, Gen. Aziz el-Masri, out of the country\nafter the Germans had sent a message asking him to proceed to Iraq to work against British interests there. The plane crashed, the attempt failed and Captain Sadat was arrested and interrogated but\nlater was released for lack of evidence.\nUndeterred, Captain Sadat made contact with two Nazi agents who passed the evenings watching the dancers at the Kit Kat, a leading Cairo nightclub. Their heavy spending brought them under surveillance,\nthey were arrested and interrogated, and they implicated their contact. As a result a swarm of British and Egyptian detectives and intelligence officers searched Captain Sadat's home. His hidden\ncache of homemade explosives went undetected, b ut he was arrested and sent to a succession of jails. While in jail, he profited from the time by polishing his English and learning German.\nIn 1944 Captain Sadat went on a hunger strike and was transferred to a prison hospital, where he dodged his guard, jumped into a friend's car and escaped. He then grew a beard and lived as a fugitive\nfor a year, helping for a time with work on a resthouse being built for King Farouk, who later was to be ousted by the junta of which Captain Sadat was a part.\nFree to Plot Once Again\nWith the end of the war came the lifting of the martial-law regulations under which Captain Sadat had been detained, enabling him to resume his real identity in freedom. He also resumed plotting against\nthe British and their Egyptian supporters. After a fellow conspirator assassinated Amin Osman Pasha, an aristocrat who favored the British presence, Captain Sadat was tried as a conspirator and acquitted\nin 1948.\nHe worked for a while in a Cairo publishing house and in 1950 got himself reinstated in the army. He was soon promoted, thanks to help from the dissident officers' clandestine network, the Free\nOfficers Organization, which had been growing in size and power under the leadership of an old friend, Lieutenant Colonel Nasser. The colonel summoned Major Sadat to a rendezvous in Cairo on July\n22, 1952, saying the long-awaited uprising, now focused on King Farouk, was to take place soon. When Nasser did not appear, the major took his wife to the movies. Arriving home late in the evening,\nthey found a note from Nasser saying operations were beginning that night and directing Major Sadat to join the revolutionaries.\n''My heart leapt,'' Mr. Sadat recalled in one of his books, ''Revolt on the Nile.'' ''I tore off my civilian clothes and threw on my uniform. In five\nminutes I was at the wheel of my car.''\nAt army headquarters, where the rebels had taken control, Nasser told him to take over the Cairo radio at dawn and to broadcast a proclamation announcing the coup. Major Sadat carried out that historic\ntask after waiting for the daily reading from the Koran to be completed.\nThe revolution led to the exile of Farouk, the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and, before long, the emergence of Nasser as strongman and President.\nWas Underestimated\nAlthough Mr. Sadat filled high posts during the Nasser era, his abilities were underestimated by many influential men in the Nasser entourage. For more than a decade he was given a succession of jobs\nthat were highly visible but of secondary importance. He served as a member of the Revolutionary Command Council, secretary general of an Islamic congress, editor of two newspapers, minister of state\nin the Cabinet; deputy chairman, chairman and speaker of the National Assembly and chairman of the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council.\nWhen Nasser named Mr. Sadat Vice President, it was widely thought that he got the job because it was largely ceremonial and had no real power, but supporters of Mr. Sadat have contended that Nasser chose\nhim to be his successor. Nasser, at odds with many other longtime associates, retained warm relations with Mr. Sadat.\nUpon Nasser's death of a heart attack, Mr. Sadat, as the only Vice President, automatically became Acting President under the Constitution. In that office and in his first months as President he\nhad to share power in a collective leadership with others; some colleagues supported him for the presidency because they thought he could be manipulated.\nIn those first weeks many Egyptians, especially students and young intellectuals, found it difficult to take him seriously. With his grin, his fancy suits and his frequent hollow-sounding vows to wage\nwar on Israel, he did not seem to be a strong and purposeful leader.\nPower\nHe showed his strength of will when, after a few months, he moved to consolidate his power by dismissing and imprisoning two of the most powerful figures in the regime, Vice President Ali Sabry, who\nhad close ties with Soviet officials, and Sharawy Gomaa, the Interior Minister, who controlled the secret police.\nMr. Sadat enhanced his popularity by displaying an intuitive sense of what the people wanted. He was doing what they wanted when he cut back the powers of the hated secret police, when he ousted the\nSoviet military experts and when he prepared for war with Israel. Nevertheless, Golda Meir, Israel's Prime Minister when he took office, correctly appraised him, she later wrote, as a ''reasonable\nman who might soberly consider the benefits'' of ending the confronta tion with Israel.\nEarly in 1973 Mr. Sadat decided to go to war against Israel. He was being criticized by students and others as an ineffective leader, and he concluded that it was necessary to break the Egyptian-Israeli\ndeadlock. ''If we don't take our case into our own hands, there will be no movement,'' he said in an interview. ''The time has come for a shock. The resumption\nof the battle is now inevitable.''\n'Landmark' for Egyptians\nAfter Moscow approved a limited Egyptian invasion of Sinai and after more Soviet arms arrived, Mr. Sadat ordered the attack on Oct. 6. Egyptian troops surged across the canal and Syrian troops struck\nIsrael from their side. In the fighting that followed, the Syrians were thrown back and the Israelis counterattacked fiercely, encircling Suez and carving out a broad bridgehead west of the canal.\nDespite Israel's strong showing, Mr. Sadat, in his memoirs, maintained that ''the Egyptian military performance was a landmark in world military history'' and that ''if\nthe United States hadn't intervened in the war and fully supported Israel, the situation could have been far different.''\nThe war spurred Washington to work to ease tensions in the Middle East; Mr. Sadat was soon visited by Mr. Kissinger. The two hit it off from the first and, Mr. Sadat wrote, began ''a relationship\nof mutual understanding culminating and crystallizing in what we came to describe as a 'peace process.' '' Before long Mr. Kissinger was able to work out a disengagement agreement\nbetween Egypt and Israel that allowed the Egyptians to take back a strip of Sinai. Mr. Sadat welcomed American participation and said later, ''No one else except the United States can play\nthis role of mediator between two sides that harbor intense hate for one another - a gulf of bad blood, violence and massacres.''\nThe agreement, signed in January 1974, was followed by months of ''shuttle diplomacy'' by Mr. Kissinger and by a second limited Egyptian-Israeli accord in September 1975. Efforts\ntoward a more comprehensive peace agreement bore no fruit in the next months, however, although the United States and the Soviet Union agreed on Oct. 1, 1977, on principles to govern a Geneva conference\non the Middle East. Syria continued to resist such a conference.\nNeed for a New Approach\nAt that point Mr. Sadat, not wanting to let Moscow and Damascus determine the pace of events, decided that a new approach was needed. Disregarding objections from his advi sers, he made the trip to Jerusalem.\nHe told the Israeli Parliment that Egypt's willingness to ''welcome you among us'' amounted to ''a decisive historical change,'' but he continued to insist\nthat the Israelis withdraw from occupied Arab land and recognize what he call ed the rights of the Palestinians. He claimed a new-found friendship with Mr. Begin and set in motion the first high-level\nEgyptian-Israeli peace talks.\nWhen Mr. Sadat returned to Cairo, he told his people that ''all barriers of doubt, mistrust and fear were shattered.'' But the negotiations bogged down over differences on the Palestinians\nand other issues; by January 1978 they were deadlocked, with Mr. Sadat denouncing the Israelis as stiff-necked. That deadlock prevailed until Mr. Sadat met with Mr. Begin and President Carter in\nSeptember 1978 at the Camp David conference called by Mr. Carter. Two weeks of talks produced signed agreements on what was called ''a framework for peace.''\nAfter further efforts Mr. Carter flew to Jerusalem and then to Cairo on March 13, 1979, with compromise proposals to break yet another deadlock, and Mr. Sadat approved them quickly in a meeting at a\nCairo airport. Later that month Mr. Sadat and Mr. Begin signed the treaty, ending 30 years of Egyptian-Israeli confrontation. ''Let us work together,'' Mr. Sadat said, paraphrasing\nthe Prophet Isaiah, ''until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.''\nIn the hard-line Arab protest against the treaty, 17 Arab nations adopted political and economic sanctions against his Government. Yet his isolation in the Arab world did not undercut his domestic support;\nhe deftly reaped political profit from the isolation by underscoring the idea, widespread in Egypt, that other Arabs had grown wealthy while the Egyptians had borne the burden of the four wars.\nEconomy Displayed Strength\nHis popularity benefited also from the fairly strong condition of the economy, which had seemed on the brink of disaster after Egypt's catastrophic defeat in the 1967 war. By late 1979 the economic\ngrowth rate had reached 9 percent a year and was one of the highest in the developing world, thanks largely to more than $1 billion a year in American aid.\nPresident Sadat's relations with the Americans and the Israelis, despite some intense friction, remained relatively harmonious in the months after the signing of the treaty. That good will paid\noff when, as a gesture of friendship, Mr. Begin fulfilled one provision of the treaty ahead of time, returning a 580-square-mile tract of Sinai to Egypt on Nov. 15, 1979, instead of on Jan. 25, as\nscheduled. Yet no real progress was made in months of Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on home rule for the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nEarly in 1980 Mr. Sadat held inconclusive talks with Mr. Begin at Aswan, in upper Egypt. Israeli forces withdrew from more of Sinai, leaving two-thirds of the area evacuated. The Israeli-Egyptian border\nwas declared open, and the two countries exchanged ambassadors. In March 1980 Mr. Sadat drew new criticism at home and in unfriendly Arab capitals when the deposed Shah of Iran, who was ill, moved\nto Cairo, accepting a longstanding invitation.\nAs the new decade got under way, President Sadat seemed confident of his policies, but events seemed to have taken a somewhat unfavorable turn. Cairo's isolation in the Arab world and elsewhere\nin the third world was galling, and the almost total reliance on Washington for food, aid and weapons was a source of concern.Inflation was running at a rate of 30 percent a year, there were signs\nof increasing repression, and Israel's policy of multiplying settlements on the occupied West Bank intensified pessimism.\nIn April 1980 President Sadat visited Washington to discuss the Israeli settlements with President Carter. From there he denounced the Israeli policy as ''unfounded, ill-conceived and illegal.''\nDissent\nIn the final months of Mr. Sadat's life, as his intricate and sometimes stormy dialogue with Israel continued, there were repeated expressions of internal opposition to his rule. They continued,\nand mounted, despite his general popularity and his continued use of such means as government food-subsidies to dampen disconent.\nEarly this year Egypt's leftist National Unionist Progressive Party publicly denounced Mr. Sadat's policies toward Israel. ''This so-called normalization with the Israeli enemy was\ndone at the expense of the Arabs and was opposed by a growing number of Egyptians,'' a party statement said.\nIn June a Government prosecutor said a former Egyptian Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Saad Eddin el-Shazli, and 18 other Egyptian dissidents living abroad had plotted to overthrow Mr. Sadat. They were said\nto have been given $2.8 million by Libya at Syria's urging. And the head of the Egyptian Bar Association complained that Mr. Sadat's regime was trying to dismember the as sociation's\nleadership because it had opposed the peace treaty with Israel.\nYet Mr. Sadat continued to give much of his attention to foreign affairs. In June he met inconclusively with Mr. Begin, for the first time in 17 months. In the meeting in an abandoned restaurant at Sharm\nel Sheik in Sinai, the Israeli leader rejected Mr. Sadat's appeal to halt Israeli attacks on Palestinian guerrilla bases in Lebanon.\nDenounced Bombing of Iraq\nA few days later Mr. Sadat was denouncing Israel for its bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor, which he called an ''unlawful, provocative'' act. It was embarrassing to him because\nMr. Begin had told him nothing about it.\nOn Aug. 3 Egypt and Israel signed an agremeent establishing a 2,500-member international peacekeeping force in Sinai to police their peace treaty. On Aug. 5 and 6 Mr. Sadat held friendly but inconclusive\ntalks with President Reagan in Washington. And on Aug. 25 and 26 he and Mr. Begin met yet again, this time in the Egyptian port of Alexandria, to try to resolve problems that had delayed normalization\nof relations.\nBut then Mr. Sadat turned his full attention to internal affairs, evidently acting in response to information about the extent of dissidence in his perennially unstable land. Citing Moslem and other\nopposition to his regime, he departed markedly from the largely velvet-glove treatment of opponents that had characterized his 11 years of rule.\nHe cracked down hard, detaining 1,600 opponents, mostly Moslem militants, partly in response to bloody rioting in June between Moslems and members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. After a hastily\ncalled referendum, his Government reported that 99.45 percent of the voters endorsed its measures to curb secular as well as religious dissidence. Moslem dissidents resented the rapprochement with\nIsrael and wanted a more Islamic cast to Egypt's government.\n'Suffering' From Democracy\nAt a news conference Sept. 9, Mr. Sadat made a wry reference to his country's heritage of violence and to the opposition to his rule. To a foreign reporter who asked an impertinent question, he\nsaid, ''In other times I would have shot you, but it is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.''\nAlso last month Mr. Sadat accused a dozen former Egyptian officials of ''conniving'' with the Soviet Union to destabilize his Government. He ordered the expulsion of more than 1,000\nSoviet citizens, including the Soviet Ambassador, Vladimir P. Polyakov.\nThe Government-supervised Egyptian press reported that Egyptian intelligence had uncovered anti-Government plotting by Soviet agents in league with Egyptian religious extremists, leftists, Nasserites,\neducators, journalists and others.\nLater in the month - even as officials of Egypt, Israel and the United States held talks in Cairo seeking a plan for self-rule for Palestinians - Mr. Sadat's Government took further action to quell\ndissidence. Among other measures, uniformed guards in university campuses were reinforced. A sweeping investigation of the bureaucracy was decreed.\nSaid Indiscipline Had Ended\nIn a widely quoted speech, Mr. Sadat asserted, in what proved to be a display of overconfidence, that all of Egypt's internal indiscipline had come to a halt.\n''Lack of discipline in any way or form,'' he said, in a two-hour televised address, ''in the streets, in the Government, in the university, in the secondary schools, in\nthe factory, in the public sector, in the private sector, this all has ended, it has ended.''\nIn Israel, however, a long-time observer of Mr. Sadat was already speaking of the possibility that his work might be snuffed out. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Raphael Eitan, said bleakly,\n''There are troubles in Egypt, and it is possible that President Sadat will go and everything will come to an end.''\nMr. Sadat was divorced from his first wife, who was from his native village; they had three daughters. His second wife, Jihan, has played a strong role in public affairs, particularly concerning the\ncondition of women and children. The four children of his second marriage are a son, Gamal, named for Nasser, and three daughters, Lubna, Noha and Jihan.\n''In Egypt, personalities have always been more important than political programs.'' - ''Revolt on the Nile,'' 1957.\n''Don't ask me to make diplomatic relations with them. Never. Never. Leave it to the coming generations to decide that, not me.'' - On Israel in 1970, a few months before he became President.\n''The situation here - mark my words - will be worse than Vietnam.'' - In a magazine interview, July 1973.\n''We have always felt the sympathy of the world, but we would prefer the respect of the world to sympathy without respect.'' - In a speech to the People's Assembly after the\nfirst attack of the Yom Kippur war, Oct. 6, 1973.\n''Let every girl, let every woman, let every mother here - and there in my country - know we shall solve all our problems through negotiations around the table rather than starting war.''\n- During his visit to Israel, November 1977.\n''I have a great ally in Israel that I depend upon. Do you know who? The Israeli mother.'' - Commenting on the vote of approval by Israel's Parliament of the peace treaty between\nEgypt and Israel, March 22, 1979.\n''In all the steps I took I was not performing a personal mission. I was merely expressing the will of a nation. I am proud of my people and of belonging to them.\n''Today a new dawn is emerging out of the darkness of the past. ''Let us work together until the day comes when they beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning\nhooks.'' - At the peace treaty signing between Egypt and Israel at the White House, March 26, 1979. ''There will be no barriers between our peoples, no more anxiety or insecurity,\nnot more suffering or suspicion.'' - Meeting with Menachem Begin at Beersheba, May 27, 1979.\n''It is democracy I am really suffering from as much as I am suffering from the opposition.'' -Speaking to foreign journalists of unrest in Egypt, Sept. 9, 1981.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Blackley, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, who led the research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It was equally troubling, he said, that nearly a quarter of the miners with complicated black lung disease had been on the job fewer than 20 years.\nAcross the coal belt in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia, \u201cthere\u2019s an unacceptably large number of younger miners who have end-stage disease and the only choice is to get a lung transplant or wait it out and die,\u201d Dr. Blackley said.\nScientists have linked the new wave of lung disease to miners breathing in more silica dust, the likely result of a decades-long shift toward mining thinner coal seams that require cutting into the surrounding rock. Silica dust from pulverized rock can damage lungs faster than coal dust alone.\nModern machinery, insufficient training for workers, and longer work hours may also contribute to increased dust exposure, experts say.\nA Sharp Rise in Complicated Black Lung Disease\nBlack lung, a chronic disease caused by breathing in coal mine dust, declined precipitously between the early 1970s and late 1990s, following new health and safety rules put in place by the 1969 Coal Act. The legislation for the first time established airborne dust limits in coal mines and set up a health monitoring program for working miners, offering free chest x-rays every five years.\nBut by 2000, black lung was on the rise again. An advanced form of the disease, rarely seen in the mid-1990s, made an especially dramatic comeback.\nComplicated Black Lung DiseasePer 1,000 working coal miners in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia\nRate of complicated black lung among working coal miners in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia\n50 cases per 1,000 miners\n48.5\n40\n30\n20\n10\n3.7\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n50 cases per 1,000 miners\n48.5\n40\n30\n20\n10\n3.7\n1975\n1985\n1995\n2005\n2015\n51.4\n48.5\n32.7\n25.3\n19.1\n19.1\n13.0\n3.7 cases per 1,000 miners\n1975\n1980\n1985\n1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\nThe upward trend in severe black lung disease has been clear for some time, but \u201cwhat we\u2019re really learning now is the magnitude of the problem,\u201d said Carl Werntz, an associate professor of occupational medicine at West Virginia University, who treats miners in Morgantown.\nIn addition to the Virginia cluster, Dr. Blackley\u2019s team previously found 60 miners with complicated black lung at a single clinic in eastern Kentucky. Overall, investigators have confirmed nearly 500 cases in just four clinics over the past four years. NPR, which began a wider survey of clinics in 2016, has unofficially recorded nearly 2,000 cases over a similar time period.\nThose figures are far higher than the federal government\u2019s voluntary screening program for working miners, which recorded fewer than 100 cases of complicated black lung disease nationwide between 2011 and 2016. Researchers note that the true extent of black lung disease among current and former coal miners remains unclear.\nNew Rules for Coal Dust Under Review\nTo combat black lung disease, the Obama administration in 2014 issued a new coal dust rule. It lowered dust exposure limits for the first time in four decades, increased sampling frequency and required the use of real-time personal dust monitoring devices.\nThe rule was challenged by coal industry groups as costly and overly burdensome. A federal appeals court upheld it in 2016.\nLast December, the Trump administration announced a retrospective review of the four-year-old regulation as part of a broader rule-cutting agenda, a move that alarmed mine safety advocates and medical experts.\n\u201cIn light of these trends showing more debilitating disease, we need more protection, not less,\u201d said Judith Graber, an assistant professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health.\nA Mine Safety and Health Administration spokesperson said that the agency\u2019s review was required and \u201cwill be used to determine if the 2014 rule is achieving its desired result.\u201d David Zatezalo, a former miner and coal industry executive who now leads the agency, told Congress on Feb. 6 that he has no current plans to roll back the updated dust limits.\nPhil Smith, director of communications and governmental affairs for the United Mine Workers of America, said that if the rule isn\u2019t working, \u201cthen we need to beef it up even more.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

We surveyed several change-makers about notable inflection points in the past year \u2014 moments when they saw art that struck them as something new.\nSpike Lee\u2019s \u2018BlacKkKlansman\u2019\nOttessa Moshfegh is a novelist. Her most recent book, \u201cMy Year of Rest and Relaxation,\u201d came out this year.\nThe amazing thing about art is that it makes you vulnerable to truth. There are things we can do in fiction that would be intolerable in nonfiction. We can tolerate watching people being murdered or raped \u2014 I\u2019ve been watching \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d with one hand over an eye. Like, I cannot believe that this exists, that people are enjoying that kind of horror. But when you\u2019re seduced by a work of art, like a film or a book, your mind becomes open. And when the documentary footage of the Charlottesville white nationalist rally came up at the end of \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d my heart was open. I wasn\u2019t approaching it from clicking around the internet, weeding through everybody\u2019s opinions. It was just this completely shocking and heartbreaking thing.\nUntil then, I\u2019d somehow forgotten that I live in a white-supremacist country. And I\u2019m so glad to be reminded of that truth, because so much of the conversation has been like, Oh, now we\u2019re actually talking about white privilege and then also white male privilege and the disempowerment of white males and their sob stories and women\u2019s victimhood. I\u2019m not trying to undermine that, but there\u2019s a much bigger systemic problem.\nI left \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d thinking, The conversations I\u2019ve been having about politics in America have been so dumb. I\u2019ve spent so much time trying to avoid what\u2019s happening in the media with gender that it has erased much more important, violent issues. It made me reflect on my own work. How political do I want to be? How directly do I want to speak to those politics? I don\u2019t really have an answer yet.\nZheng Bo\u2019s \u2018Pteridophilia\u2019\nToyin Ojih Odutola is a Nigerian-American visual artist. Her solo exhibition \u201cTo Wander Determined\u201d appeared at the Whitney Museum from October 2017 until February this year.\nYou hear it before you see it. There are these moans and grunts and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d And then you just arrive at it. You see a screen through the bamboo trees, and you enter the enclave, with well-hidden speakers around it. I saw it just by happenstance, walking through the botanical gardens in Palermo for the Manifesta art biennial, and I was completely transfixed by it.\nThe video installation features men interacting with a forest: licking the plants, hugging them. You\u2019re seeing these men, who are naked, so the whole thing seems very sexual, but when you start watching it \u2014 this film is about 10 minutes, maybe? \u2014 you realize that\u2019s just the surface. It\u2019s about this yearning that people have to connect with someone or something. In our contemporary life, there is such a distance now, or they\u2019re a lot more guarded when it comes to opening themselves up to that kind of vulnerability.\nI\u2019d never seen the naked male body applied in such a vulnerable way that doesn\u2019t feel gimmicky or like it\u2019s trying to be shocking. It\u2019s not exploitative at all. It definitely made me reconsider how to present a naked body, because as an image-maker I deal primarily with black figures, and when people display people of color there\u2019s often that slippery slope where that can get very exploitative. These are Asian men who are naked, and there\u2019s nothing that is demeaning, nothing from the lens of the colonizer. It\u2019s purely them.\nAneesh Chaganty\u2019s \u2018Searching\u2019\nJenny Han is an author of young adult fiction. The film adaptation of her book \u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d came out this year.\nThe entire film plays out over screens \u2014 computer screens, cellphone screens, home-surveillance video screens. We see the entire story through the camera\u2019s eye via home videos, texts, social media. I\u2019ve never seen that before as a storytelling device. It\u2019s a little disorienting at first, because you\u2019re literally watching the cursor go across the screen. Watching it in a theater, no less, felt both intimate and like a shared community experience, as if you were a group of people watching over someone\u2019s shoulder as they navigate online. It felt voyeuristic.\nIt was also the first time I\u2019ve seen a mainstream contemporary thriller with an Asian-American actor at the center. I saw it at the Asian American International Film Festival, so the whole crowd was mostly Asian people, which was fun because everybody was excited to see John Cho have his star moment. Nothing in the script requires him to be Asian \u2014 he just is. I would like to see more of this, stories centered on people of color where the plot isn\u2019t predicated on them being people of color.\nI made a movie, and one of the issues of getting the movie cast and having the movie made at all was that the producers in the studios did not understand why she had to be Asian where nothing in the story required her to be Asian. Too often, when the lead is a person of color, the story is all about their struggle with their identity. It centers on their pain. Those stories are important, too, but sometimes I just want to watch a thriller or a rom-com and not have it be so weighted. As moviegoers, let us see the full range of human experience.\nMarvel\u2019s Spider-Man for PS4\nBo Burnham is a stand-up comic and the writer and director of the film \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d which came out this year.\nIt might not be very highbrow or cool, but the game has an open-world map of New York City that you can swing through as Spider-Man, and it\u2019s truly mind-blowing. You can go uptown or swing around Central Park. I stumbled on Washington Square Park, where I spent so much of my late teens and early 20s. That was a very emotional moment. I couldn\u2019t believe how real everything looked. Or you can climb to the top of the Empire State Building or the Flatiron Building.\nI\u2019ve brought over older friends and friends who don\u2019t play video games just to show them how incredibly beautiful video games can be. They used to be like an imitation of an experience that was fantastical, and now they are the fantastical experience. A lot of people who don\u2019t play games don\u2019t realize that the artistic endeavor of a video game is better than any blockbuster movie. And because video games are a less-straightforward narrative, they\u2019re often able to be artistically riskier than a $200 million film.\nPart of the appeal of games is that at first your jaw is on the floor because you\u2019re swinging around and going, \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m Spider-Man!\u201d And then two weeks later, you\u2019re playing it, and you\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m Spider-Man, who cares?\u201d That\u2019s almost what you\u2019re pursuing, that competency that goes hand in hand with jadedness. There was a Spider-Man game when I was a kid \u2014 I thought it could never get cooler than that. It did. I hope it never gets cooler than this, because if it does, we\u2019re just going to be plugged in and getting fed through an IV.\nLayli Long Soldier\u2019s \u2018Whereas\u2019\nJesmyn Ward is a novelist and 2017 MacArthur Fellow. Her most recent book, \u201cSing, Unburied, Sing,\u201d won the 2017 National Book Award for fiction.\nI recently read this collection because it won a National Book Critics Circle Award this year. There\u2019s a poem called \u201cHe Sapa,\u201d and the second section \u2014 it\u2019s like 11 lines or something \u2014 is about the word \u201cdrag.\u201d She unpeels that word and paints this really vivid picture of a man who\u2019s been violently dragged, a Native American who has been killed. How his hair would be loose, and how his shirt would have snaps, and they\u2019re mother-of-pearl, and how the dragging begins with a yank and a slide. It\u2019s so specific, so unrelenting in its definition of what it means to drag someone \u2014 to enact this violence on someone else.\nThe book is a response to a congressional apology to Native Americans, where the meaning behind the words wasn\u2019t clear. She is unpacking that language and unveiling the truth beneath it, the history and behavior on the part of the United States government. There\u2019s this tendency by those powers that be to obfuscate meaning and to take power away from language by robbing it of its truth. One reason this book struck me so much is because she\u2019s directly speaking against that.\nHer book and that poem, in particular, reminded me what careful language can do. It made me recommit to writing \u2014 I\u2019m really working into the past in the novel I\u2019m working on now because I\u2019m writing about slavery, which has been really difficult for me to do \u2014 and made me believe again in the power of writing and the truths that it can reveal for people and what that remembering and honoring the truth can do for the individual, but also for the group, for all of us.\nSeth Price\u2019s \u2018Danny, Mila, Hannah, Ariana, Bob, Brad\u2019\nTaryn Simon is a multidisciplinary artist. She was a 2001 Guggenheim fellow.\nSeth Price\u2019s recent exhibition at MoMA PS1 is a series of abstract portraits of magnified details of human skin in superhigh resolution. He used a robotic camera system that\u2019s usually employed for scientific research and took thousands of images of a body part and stitched them together with satellite-imaging software. They\u2019re printed on fabric and stretched over light boxes, so they\u2019re almost like advertisements to us of what we are. It felt like seeing the tools of photography and documentation working almost too well. They\u2019re cataloging and processing our most intimate and most unknowable selves, and the cellular detail of who we are, and where we come from, and what that means was just overwhelming.\nEven though the cameras are hyperclose on the humans, they somehow render a completely foreign space. I was just reading about 3-D photographs that can capture dynamic images of proteins at a single-atom scale \u2014 and thinking about how we\u2019re also at a time that seems to have lost its taste for precision. The work just rode that line for me. Price used extreme technologies, but to no end beyond making us feel something.\nLarge-format photography has always traditionally been understood as being able to see more than the eye can see, and this exhibition felt as if it was that, but on steroids. In a way, the more precise the camera has become, the more otherworldly the images and the psychological space it renders. The further you go in that direction, the stranger and more fantastical it all becomes. The experience makes you feel that you\u2019ve entered another universe.\nCristina Gallego and Ciro Guerra\u2019s \u2018Birds of Passage\u2019\nDamien Chazelle is a screenwriter and an Oscar-winning director. His next movie, \u201cFirst Man,\u201d comes out in October.\nThe film begins as a variation on an ancient tale: You\u2019re in this tiny Colombian village, and a man wants to wed a woman he loves, but he doesn\u2019t have the dowry. Slowly he stumbles into the drug trade. You\u2019re not even entirely sure what era this is; it all feels somewhat timeless. The very first time you see a car, maybe 20 minutes or half an hour in, is almost a shocking moment \u2014 it\u2019s an emblem of modernity encroaching on the village. There\u2019s this initial cognitive dissonance about the world that you think you\u2019re in. It\u2019s a like a frog being boiled in water and not realizing that the water is being turned up. By the end, you\u2019re in a full-fledged, and quite violent, mob movie, but that transition of storytelling \u2014 from one world to the other \u2014 is done so methodically and elegantly that it never feels like a schism. It feels like a natural, organic unfolding of the story.\nI don\u2019t think the movie would work half as well if it didn\u2019t take the time in the beginning to live in the details and the texture \u2014 almost in a documentary way \u2014 of the world it depicts. You become almost like an anthropologist: You\u2019re examining this culture and these rituals before you really know what the narrative is going to be. It\u2019s a courageous thing to do as a filmmaker, because there\u2019s often this impulse that you want to set your gambit right away, but this film is brave enough to let that happen slowly.\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.\nIllustrations by Tim McDonagh\nThe Culture Issue\n-\nLady Gaga Isn\u2019t Done Shape-Shifting Yet\nOct. 3, 2018\n-\nShould Art Be a Battleground for Social Justice?\nOct. 3, 2018\n-\nWhat Makes \u2018The Good Place\u2019 So Good?\nOct. 4, 2018\n-\nBarry Jenkins\u2019s Films of Love, Pain and Black Male Vulnerability\nOct. 4, 2018\n-\nThe Ugly Beauty of Cindy Sherman\u2019s Instagram Selfies\nOct. 5, 2018\n-\nSeven Boundary-Pushing Cultural Moments of 2018\nOct. 5, 2018\nRelated Coverage\n-\nLady Gaga Isn\u2019t Done Shape-Shifting Yet\nOct. 3, 2018\n-\nShould Art Be a Battleground for Social Justice?\nOct. 3, 2018\n-\nWhat Makes \u2018The Good Place\u2019 So Good?\nOct. 4, 2018\n-\nBarry Jenkins\u2019s Films of Love, Pain and Black Male Vulnerability\nOct. 4, 2018\n-\nThe Ugly Beauty of Cindy Sherman\u2019s Instagram Selfies\nOct. 5, 2018\n-\nSeven Boundary-Pushing Cultural Moments of 2018\nOct. 5, 2018", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

This software could track customers\u2019 every online move, intercept secure web sessions and render their computers vulnerable to hackers.\nThe company buried its software in the lowest level of a PC\u2019s operating system, precisely where customers and antivirus products would never detect it, and had been siphoning data back to servers belonging to Superfish, an Israeli software company headquartered in Silicon Valley that markets itself as a visual search company.\nThe discoveries are the latest in a string of revelations that indicate that as traditional security defenses have begun fully to surround the outer layers of our devices, criminals, nation-states\u2019 hackers and apparently advertisers have turned their focus inward, to the very heart of the machine, where their code is easily concealed.\nBefore this week\u2019s discoveries, there have been only two known cases of malicious code attacking the lowest level of a machine. The first was a 1998 computer virus, called CIH, for the initials of its author, Chen Ing-Hau, then a 24-year-old college student in Taiwan.\nThe virus was dubbed Chernobyl because it was timed to strike on April 26, 1999, the 13th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Though it was designed to prove that a concept would work in the real world, it quickly spread beyond Taipei\u2019s Tatung Institute of Technology to millions of computers around the world.\nThe incident was a wake-up call to computer security experts, who for years had been developing antivirus products for the outer layers of a computer\u2019s operating system, but not the lowest levels of a machine. Security experts started to talk about there being \u201ca race to the bare metal\u201d of a machine.\nTheir fears were realized in September 2011, after security researchers discovered Mebromi, a second virus. The virus modified the first software that runs on a machine \u2014 the basic-input-output-system, or BIOS \u2014 in such a way that any attempt to clean it from the computer would be futile because the BIOS would just continue to reinfect it. But Mebromi affected only a small set of Chinese users.\nWhat makes the latest discoveries so disconcerting is that if a government or company can plant spyware in the lowest level of a machine, it can steal your passwords, serve up any web page, steal your encryption keys and control your entire digital experience, undetected.\n\u201cIf they can do that, they can do anything,\u201d said Peter Horne, the technology expert who first discovered the spyware in Lenovo\u2019s products.\nMr. Horne, a 25-year veteran of the financial services technology industry, was the first to discover Superfish early last month in a new Lenovo Yoga 2 Notepad he bought in Sydney, Australia.\nEven though the PC came with McAfee antivirus software, Mr. Horne said, he installed antivirus software made by Trend Micro. Neither virus scanner picked up adware on the machine. But Mr. Horne noted that traffic from the PC was being redirected to a website called best-deals-products.com. When he dug further, he found that website\u2019s server was making calls to Superfish adware.\nSuperfish\u2019s \u201cvisual discovery\u201d adware, Mr. Horne and others now say, is far more intrusive than typical adware. It not only drops ads into a user\u2019s web browser sessions, it hijacks a secure browsing session and scoops up data as users enter it into secure websites. In the process, it makes it easy for hackers to intercept communications.\nMr. Horne returned his PC and went on to test Lenovo\u2019s demonstration machines at Best Buy stores in New York and Boston and at other retailers in Sydney and Perth. He found Superfish adware on other Lenovo Yoga 2 models and the Lenovo Edge 15.\nSuperfish\u2019s co-founder, Adi Pinhas, did not return requests for comment.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Lenovo said it had included Superfish in some consumer notebooks shipped between September and December \u201cto help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping.\u201d\nCiting bad user reviews, the company said it had stopped including the adware in January, the same month Mr. Horne brought the issue to the company\u2019s attention (and never received a response).\nBy partnering with Superfish, Mr. Horne said, \u201cLenovo is either extraordinarily stupid or covering up. Either is an offense to me.\u201d\nAs news of the Lenovo issue began circulating on Thursday, security researchers developed online tools for users to figure out whether Superfish was installed on their machines, and Microsoft began rooting out Superfish with its Windows Defender antivirus software.\n\u201cThe problem is: What can we trust?\u201d Mr. Horne said. \u201cPeople trust software, then learn it gets compromised. We trust hardware and firmware, until you learn it\u2019s been compromised with adware. We trust the actual box, until we learn it\u2019s been taken into a little room somewhere.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But the Treasury Department said it would give businesses and individuals time \u2013 either 90 days or 180 days \u2013 for an \u201corderly wind down of activities.\u201d\nIn a 10-page guidance document, the Treasury said sanctions enforcement would begin Aug. 6 on activities that include Iran\u2019s purchase of commercial aircraft and services, Iran\u2019s exports of carpets and food to the United States, and Iran\u2019s trade in dollars, precious metals, industrial software, sovereign debt and the automotive sector.\nOn Nov. 4, sanctions enforcement would begin on industries that include shipping, oil, petrochemicals, insurance, energy and specialized banking and financial services.\nThe sanctions\u2019 effects will depend partly on how non-American businesses and foreign governments respond, and whether they decide to risk U.S. penalties.\nThe most vulnerable Iranian industry may be oil, said Farhad Alavi, managing partner of Akrivis Law Group, a Washington law firm that specializes in international trade. The old U.S. sanctions, he said, \u201ccaused a severe drop in Iran oil exports \u2013 it was selling oil under the table at a discount.\u201d\nThe deal could survive\nMaking good on a campaign promise to exit the nuclear agreement, Mr. Trump described it as so weak and lopsided in Iran\u2019s favor that it was \u201ca great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.\u201d\nHe faulted it for allowing Iran to eventually resume enrichment of nuclear fuel and for what he described as its failure to limit Iran\u2019s missile development and \u201cother malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria, Yemen and other places all around the world.\u201d\nBut the American withdrawal does not necessarily mean the Iran agreement collapses \u2014 at least not immediately. Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia are still parties to the agreement. If they all agree to maintain it, the effect of restored American sanctions may be softened.\nMr. Trump also held out the possibility of negotiating a new agreement with Iran, though its leaders have said that won\u2019t happen.\nIf the deal collapses, Iran will presumably be free to restart thousands of centrifuges mothballed under the agreement. That would let it increase its uranium fuel supply \u2013 without the close monitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nIran has said it could restore its uranium-enriching capability quickly, which could put it closer to a weapons path. But that might put Iran at risk of economic isolation, at least by the European countries that agreed to the accord.\nWhat nuclear capabilities did Iran have before the deal?\nIran had the technical capability to become a nuclear-weapons state, experts say.\nAccording to U.S. intelligence agency assessments, the Iranians once operated a covert nuclear weapons development program that they discontinued in 2003.\nWhile Iran has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear activities are for peaceful use only, it had amassed a stockpile of uranium that further refining could have turned into fuel for nuclear bombs.\nBy some reckonings, Iran needed only a few months to make the required bomb fuel. It would have needed considerably more time to make a reliable warhead for a missile to deliver such a weapon.\nU\nPu\nUranium\nPlutonium\nCentrifuges\n\u2018Breakout\u2019 time\nAbout 8,000 kilograms\nProduction capable\nMore than 19,000\nThree months or less\nThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.\nAmount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.\nIf the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.\nThe rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.\nUranium\nU\nAbout 8,000 kilograms\nIf the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.\nPlutonium\nPu\nProduction capable\nThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.\nCentrifuges\nMore than 19,000\nThe rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.\n\u2018Breakout\u2019 time\nThree months or less\nAmount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.\nU\nPu\nUranium\nPlutonium\nCentrifuges\n\u2018Breakout\u2019 time\nAbout 8,000 kilograms\nProduction capable\nMore than 19,000\nThree months or less\nThe heavy-water nuclear reactor under construction at Arak was meant to generate electricity, but its spent fuel could have also been mined for plutonium, a potent bomb fuel.\nAmount of time it would have taken Iran to produce enough bomb-grade material for a single nuclear weapon.\nIf the 3.5 percent (low-enriched) uranium had been further enriched to weapons-grade (90 percent or more), the stockpile would have been sufficient to fuel more than seven nuclear warheads.\nThe rapidly spinning machines were enriching uranium at two main facilities, Fordow and Natanz.\nIran\u2019s nuclear capabilities at the time the agreement was reached reflected a longstanding effort by the country to harness nuclear power. It began well before the revolution that overthrew the American-backed shah in 1979.\nIran is a signer of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, requiring it to use nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes.\nDespite Iran\u2019s repeated denials, questions began to intensify more than 15 years ago about whether it had worked clandestinely to develop nuclear weapon capabilities.\nLed by the United States, Western powers sought to pressure Iran with economic sanctions to curb its steadily increasing capacity to enrich uranium and produce plutonium, the fuels of atomic weapons.\nAfter years of off-again-on-again negotiations, an agreement was reached in 2015 between Iran and the major world powers \u2013 Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.

But as the President\u2019s Task Force on 21st Century Policing stated, \u201cWhile technology is crucial to law enforcement, it is never a panacea.\u201d\nThe task force cautioned that technology \u201ccan have unintended consequences for both the organization and the community it serves\u201d and warned that agencies \"must pay close attention to community concerns about its use.\u201d\nThese words are especially salient with respect to predictive policing software that some researchers claim is better than human analysts at determining where crime is likely to occur and, thus, preventing it.\nFor example, a spate of car thefts on one block might mean that an auto-theft ring is targeting that particular area. A police department responds accordingly by implementing proactive interventions such as placing additional officers on patrol or setting up surveillance cameras to monitor surrounding areas. When public safety budgets are tight, strategically deploying limited resources in areas most likely to experience crime can have a significant impact.\nGiven this technology\u2019s potential benefits, it is obvious why many police departments have plans to acquire it. But agencies must consider the limitations of this technology, as well as its potential impact on how these areas are policed.\nAlgorithms cannot inform police about the underlying conditions in the \u201chot spot\u201d that contribute to crime in that area. A computer cannot tell the police department that rival gangs that are about to engage in a violent confrontation about territory, but a local resident could. Thus, departments should avoid over-reliance on these technologies and must continue to focus on policing models that build community-police partnerships.\nIn a climate where many racial minorities, particularly those living in impoverished urban areas, already believe they experience unfair police scrutiny, the department must resist using aggressive police tactics that further erode the trust and legitimacy of the department. Residents should be a part of implementing whatever interventions the department believes will be helpful in reducing crime.\nThis technology creates the risk that police view everyone in the \u201chot spot,\u201d even the law-abiding residents, as a potential threat. This phenomenon creates tension and further destabilizes an area most in need of police protection.\nThese concerns do not mean that police should avoid using potentially valuable crime-reduction technologies, but they underscore that police training and community engagement remain important pieces in the mosaic of criminal justice reforms.\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

What does a standard of constant surveillance mean for kids, many are asking, and for their families?\nThe electronics company LG recently announced its development of KizON, a wristband for kids that will let their parents track them remotely. The device isn\u2019t available in Europe or the United States yet, but it has already prompted privacy worries. At Wired UK, Liat Clark writes:\n\u201cIt feels as though KizON is a beginner\u2019s anti-privacy tool, training the next generation to forget about all this NSA nonsense and get on with living life as something of an open book. Today, we have become used to conversations focusing on the implications of living in a post-privacy world. KizON\u2019s existence suggests we have totally given up on the idea that we can reclaim that sense of privacy and autonomy.\u201d\nShe also worries the device panders to parents\u2019 less than admirable instincts: \u201cThe uncomfortable thing is this is squarely aimed at parents, whose paranoia the device\u2019s very existence plays on.\u201d She adds, \u201cIf the worst happened, and the kid did go missing or was taken, surely we may as well go all the way and just implant them with a tracker chip. It\u2019s the only way to be sure we know where they are at all times.\u201d\nIn The Guardian, Rory Carroll expresses similar concerns about tracking technology in development at Cisco. He describes a scenario in which a child\u2019s every move can be closely monitored: \u201cAs they ride on the bus Foster\u2019s phone and a sensor on a wristband alert the school and his parents of a deviation from his normal route. The school has been notified that he is heading to Aiden\u2019s house so the police are not called.\u201d And, he writes:\n\u201cWhat sort of childhood is it with every move tracked, scrutinised, logged, judged? Where you cannot wander, try something new, be spontaneous \u2013 be yourself \u2013 without issuing a beeping alert from wearable, connected technology? This is helicopter parenting at its most stultifying, a constant, hovering presence.\u201d\nOn Twitter, the Wall Street Journal tech columnist Christopher Mims poses another question: \u201cWill mainstreaming of always-on child trackers make us more or less permissive with our own and others\u2019 children?\u201d\nIndeed, recent news has thrown the issue of child supervision \u2014 how closely kids need to be watched, and what happens when authorities decide they haven\u2019t been watched closely enough \u2014 into high relief. Mr. Mims also points to the case of Debra Harrell, a South Carolina mom who was jailed for leaving her nine-year-old daughter in a park while she went to work.\nAt The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf questions the idea that letting a nine-year-old play at the park alone is dangerous:\n\u201cParents ought to enjoy broad latitude in bringing up their children. There are obviously limits. The state ought to intervene if a child is being abused. But letting a 9-year-old go to the park alone doesn\u2019t come close to meeting that threshold.\u201d\nJessica Grose offers a similar argument at Slate:\n\u201cIt should be normalized for children who are nearing the end of elementary school to begin doing some things on their own. If every parent who let their fourth-graders go to the park unsupervised were arrested, all the moms from 1972 would have been behind bars.\u201d\nAnd, she adds, the case has disturbing implications for parents: \u201cHow can I appropriately parent my child when doing something that seems relatively safe, if out of fashion, can get you arrested?\u201d\nAs Stacia L. Brown points out on her blog, this risk of arrest may be magnified by racial bias:\n\u201cCases like Debra Harrell\u2019s frighten me. They reify the idea that the rules are different for my black family. For us, noisy nighttime play or unsupervised daytime play don\u2019t just draw annoyance or concern. They draw authorities. They draw teams of people with the power to determine whether or not our children can come home.\u201d\nAnd, she asks:\n\u201cAt what point does incurious observation become concern? At what point should concern involve intervention? And once authorities have intervened, which infractions should warrant the removal of children from their homes?\u201d\nThe advent of child tracking devices raises some related questions. Mr. Mims asks how they will affect our treatment of children \u2014 but what about our treatment of parents? Will we judge those who don\u2019t track their children? Will we incarcerate them? Will letting kids leave the house without their trackers become the new equivalent of letting them play unsupervised at the park: something that was once acceptable but that we now deem criminally negligent?\nAnd how will our existing biases play into these new norms? Kati Sipp, a writer and union organizer, hints at this last question in her response to Mr. Mims\u2019s tweet. Of child tracking technology, she asks, \u201cWill it allow us to maintain our class prejudices?\u201d Neither she nor Mr. Mims seems optimistic that the new devices would somehow erase these prejudices. And as they make their way to market, these devices may serve as a reminder that our society\u2019s attitudes toward caring for children may be informed not just by our best impulses, but by our worst ones.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

He was approached by two people who attempted to rob him, surveillance video shows. One of the would-be thieves pulled out a handgun and shot him in the stomach, killing him.\nThe story has garnered national attention because of the random nature of the crime, the victim\u2019s age and the fact that he had a baby on the way. \u201cThis is a safe city, and that\u2019s why this murder is particularly troubling,\u201d one of the city\u2019s district police commanders said. But six people were shot and killed in Indianapolis that week, drawing attention to a serious problem: Its murder rate eclipses Chicago\u2019s, and most of those killings are perpetrated with firearms.\nLast year there were 140 murders in Indianapolis, which has a population of 844,220. This is 10 percent more homicides per capita than Chicago. So far this year, 41 people have been murdered, compared to 32 at this time in 2013\u2014a 28 percent increase. What\u2019s happening in Indy?\nThe city is a manufacturing, trading and health care hub, but 381 street gangs operate within its borders, and police presence has not kept up with the pace of growth. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow to be this big, world class city and don\u2019t grow your public safety to keep up with it,\u201d Joe Wynns, a former city park director, told ABC 6 last year. \u201cYou\u2019ll become a murder capital of the world.\u201d Only 1,500 police officers patrol the city, and \u201cwe can\u2019t be everywhere all the time,\u201d Lt. Chris Bailey of the Indianapolis Metropolitan police said at a crime-prevention meeting last night.\nWith the uptick in gun violence in recent years, community and church groups have picked up the slack, patrolling the streets and engaging with youth. Educators say kids as young as 12, many of whom come from strong middle-class homes, are joining criminal enterprises for money, protection and prestige.\nOne of those kids, 16-year-old Simeon Adams, is the prime suspect in Nathan Trapuzzano\u2019s murder. When police caught up with him, he was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the neck he received only hours after Trapuzzano\u2019s killing. Adams is also wanted for shooting another man two days before that.\n\u201cOh how my already wounded heart aches to hear this,\u201d Jennifer Trapuzzano posted on Facebook. \u201cNate always said one of the greatest crimes in the world today is how many babies grow up without their father. I don\u2019t know this man\u2019s circumstances but it hurts to hear that such a young man could turn to such violence. Please pray for his conversion.\u201d\nHere is today\u2019s report.\n\u2014Jennifer Mascia\nA Marine at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina was shot and killed by another Marine Tuesday afternoon.

He had been walking home from a party with friends when someone opened fire on the group, striking him in his spinal cord, chest and hand and relegating him to a wheelchair. In recent years he didn\u2019t want to leave the house, and became further agitated by his older brother\u2019s shooting last year.

Gen. Wang Hongguang in the populist Chinese newspaper Global Times.\nBut General Wang\u2019s ire was not aimed at the Pentagon\u2019s annual report on the Chinese military, published last week, but rather an earlier article in the American magazine The National Interest, titled \u201cFive American Weapons of War China Should Fear.\u201d\nIn it, the author, Kyle Mizokami, while assuring readers that the chances of war between China and the United States are remote, listed the weapons \u201cChina likely fears most,\u201d including American aircraft carriers, the fifth-generation F-22 Raptor jet and the Virginia-class submarine. The article was published in mid-May but has only recently been circulating in Chinese translation.\nIt apparently hit a sore spot with General Wang, who retired in 2012 after serving as deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region. He said the article was \u201cfull of flaws\u201d and deserved a rebuttal. He did not mention an earlier article by Mr. Mizokami, which listed the \u201cFive Chinese Weapons of War America Should Fear.\u201d\nGeneral Wang argued against the usefulness of a list of individual weapons, saying that battles are fought more broadly between the forces of both sides and that the author\u2019s approach shows him to be \u201cextremely unprofessional.\u201d\nGeneral Wang also boasted of China\u2019s ability to defend itself against United States aircraft carriers, which The National Interest article said \u201crepresent a threat not only to Chinese naval and air forces away from China, but could strike China itself.\u201d The article argued that the United States carriers \u201crepresent a showcase of technologies that China hasn\u2019t mastered.\u201d\nWhile acknowledging that American technology is \u201ctruly much more advanced\u201d than China\u2019s, General Wang said that China\u2019s missile arsenal could counter American carriers. China\u2019s sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is a refitted Soviet-era ship purchased from Ukraine and was the object of much national pride in China when it was relaunched in 2012.\nThe general also took umbrage at the article\u2019s unfavorable comparison of Chinese with American jets and aircraft defense systems. Mr. Mizokami argued, for example, that the American F-22 jets\u2019 ability to evade radar meant it \u201ccan likely penetrate Chinese air defenses.\u201d\nWithout revealing exactly what systems he had in mind \u2014 \u201cfor secrecy reasons\u201d \u2014 General Wang said that China had \u201cmany types\u201d of aircraft detection systems.\n\u201cMay I suggest to Americans, when using stealth aircraft it\u2019s best to keep away from the Chinese mainland. Remember! Remember!\u201d he warned.\nChina has long resented American air and ship surveillance in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2001, a collision between a U.S. Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane and a Chinese fighter jet off the coast of Hainan Province led to a diplomatic crisis. After the encounter, in which the Chinese pilot was killed, China detained the 24 American crew members for more than a week.\nGeneral Wang\u2019s resentment of United States criticism of the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s capabilities had apparently been building for some time. He wrote, \u201cIn recent years, there are always some Americans jumping out with wildly arrogant remarks, belittling China\u2019s combat ability including weapons and equipment level.\u201d\nHe wrote that China\u2019s military equipment was undergoing rapid development that would make people look at it in \u201ca new light.\u201d\nHe also posited fundamental differences in the national character of China versus the United States. Although he insisted such attributes were \u201cjust a characteristic\u201d and neither good nor bad, he described the American national character as \u201coutgoing, arrogant and flamboyant.\u201d The Chinese character, he said, was \u201cintroverted, modest, tolerant and not flamboyant in action.\u201d\nIt is unclear to what extent General Wang\u2019s comments represent the views of Chinese military and civilian policy makers. However, it seems clear that his retirement has given him a public voice that serving officers do not enjoy.\n\u201cIn the past, although I wanted to refute some wildly arrogant views I saw from Americans who did not know their own limitations, because of the constraints of secrecy, I could only suppress the truth in my heart,\u201d he wrote.\nThis is also not the first time that General Wang has spoken out about strategic issues and international affairs. He has been one of the rare Chinese military officers to have publicly criticized North Korea. In March, he said that North Korea\u2019s launch of a short-range rocket that crossed the trajectory of a Chinese civilian airliner was \u201ca rather unfriendly attitude\u201d and \u201chighly risky.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Bribery Inquiry Drawing Closer to FIFA\u2019s Chief.\nToday\u2019s top stories.\nWhat disturbed you most?\nWe seem to be in a season of mass-drowning stories, and they are hard to read. I try not to skip over them though. This one from the Yangtze was tough \u2014 so vivid.\n\u201cMost of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old and had been traveling on a group tour.\u201d Also, \u201cThe water where the boat sank is about 50 feet deep. Rescuers could hear the sounds of people trapped inside \u2026 \u201d\nAccording to Peter Baker\u2019s news analysis, a vast antiterrorism infrastructure will remain in place regardless of how the Senate votes on the Patriot Act. Does that seem right to you?\nThis campaign-season theater around expiry of the NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance program has been frustrating. Even if you try to read the stories to filter out all the ephemeral politics, it\u2019s hard to get a grip on what is really at issue \u2014 the structure of the surveillance regime itself.\nIf phone companies hold our metadata rather than the NSA, what difference will it make, given that the FISA courts are secret and not hard to please?\nWhat use is actually being made of these powers by prosecutors, from day to day? Why are they being used in so many drug cases?\nThe Associated Press had an investigative story this week, with this lede: \u201cThe FBI is operating a small air force with scores of low-flying planes across the country carrying video and, at times, cellphone surveillance technology \u2014 all hidden behind fictitious companies that are fronts for the government, the Associated Press has learned.\u201d\nHuh? Maybe it\u2019s time to give the black helicopter crowd down in Texas some credit.\nLindsey Graham enters the Presidential campaign. How closely are you following the endless campaign coverage?\nI try to read all the horse race coverage every day, especially about the Republican primary, because it seems so open and fluid.\nLindsey Graham is a more-vivid-than-typical Washington figure. He\u2019s known as a hawk but he does think independently. Name another Deep South Republican who is willing to price carbon to fight climate change. And he\u2019s been constructive on immigration.\nI hope he makes the cut for the early debates. I assume he has no chance to be nominated but he would liven things up, intelligently.\nWhat story in today\u2019s paper surprised you most?\nI gave some dwell time to the story about the city of Paris starting to dismantle the love locks on the Pont des Arts. These are locks like you\u2019d put on a gym locker that lovers place on the bridge as a symbol of their mutual devotion, tossing the key into the Seine.\nI was in Paris recently and the locks are really, really ugly, a kind of vandalism. The craze to affix them on bridges in more and more cities feels like secular hysteria. But who are we to argue with people in love?\nI enjoyed the reminder in this story of the pleasures of writing foreign correspondence, how you write through banal facts in a light feature-y way, testing what your editor will let into the paper.\nHere is the 12th paragraph: \u201cThe locks still affixed to the bridge weigh an estimated 45 tons and will be kept in a city warehouse after they are removed \u2026 Some are likely to be melted down, meeting the same fate as the love of some who attached them to the bridge, but others may have a second life.\u201d Ka-Ching.\nDo you think the paper has successfully adapted to the culture of digital media?\nIt\u2019s getting there, probably the best we have from a legacy newspaper.\nJournalism has always been about fusing reporting, story and audience as technology changes \u2014 it\u2019s been that way since the birth of radio.\nI think The Times is well around the corner in publishing its distinctive journalism at a digital tempo and at experimenting with video, interactivity, computational journalism etc. The number of readers paying for digital subscriptions is encouraging for those of us who feel it is essential that The Times succeed.\nThe next hill is to figure out how to integrate coders with journalists and iterate continuously, while holding on to the core values. I\u2019m clapping as hard as I can from the bleachers.\nThere\u2019s an interesting Upshot piece today about college enrollment and income and reader\u2019s thoughts on the correlation. Do you follow the Upshot with special interest?\nI\u2019m a big fan of Upshot. I spent a lot of time with this morning\u2019s interactive graphic. It\u2019s great that 70,000 readers tried to guess what such a policy nerd line would look like. That sort of online engagement, rewarded with a group shout-out on page three of the print edition, is what will create a digital community willing to pay premium prices for Times subscriptions, I would think (or hope).\nHow has the journalism school curriculum changed in recent years? Are J-school grads interested in different kinds of jobs than they were five years ago?\nYes we are trying to teach them how to get jobs at Upshot!\nSeriously, the main change is to figure out how to integrate the teaching of statistics, coding, computation, data science, the reverse engineering of algorithms, etc. with hard core public interest journalism. The students want that sort of instruction, fortunately, and sign up for it in droves.\nThis year we also saw an out-of-the-blue doubling of applications for our investigative reporting and documentary filmmaking programs. Warms the heart, actually.\nIn the classroom I find that a lot of young journalists these days are very serious about their work. They want to do the math, go deep, work in long form.\nAre there sections you read with special pleasure. Business? Sports? Science? Style?\nI\u2019m a devoted and undiscriminating sports fan and I think the Sports section is terrific these days, given its position against the New York tabloids, and given that it doesn\u2019t have as many columns in the print edition to work with as I would like. Great to have Michael Powell\u2019s shoe leather reporting and unpredictable voice in Sports now.\nAre there columnists or critics you read with special interest?\nJim Stewart is a colleague at Columbia, and I\u2019ve been a big fan ever since he used to clean my clock at The Wall Street Journal when I was a kid beat reporter covering securities fraud in the Drexel Burnham era. His Friday column in Business is best in class.\nIt will probably ensure she can never review one of my books again, but I should say that I\u2019m also a huge Michiko Kakutani fan and read all of her reviews to the end. Her body of criticism about nonfiction since September 11 has no equal in its consistency and knowledge and I\u2019m sure I would say that even if she didn\u2019t appreciate my own work.\nDo you read obituaries? Wedding announcements? Recipes?\nObituaries, always. Weddings, sometimes. Recipes, never. If you start a Thai take-in column, I\u2019ll read that.\nAnything in today\u2019s paper that made you laugh?\nWell, sardonically. I was very interested in the article about the Supreme Court decision in the case brought by the unsuccessful applicant to Abercrombie & Fitch, who sued for discrimination under the Civil Rights Act because her head scarf did not conform to the chain\u2019s \u201cclassic East Coast collegiate style.\u201d\nDown in the story, Adam Liptak quotes an Abercrombie spokeswoman saying the company \u201chas granted numerous religious accommodations when requested, including hijabs.\u201d On the sales floor? Really?\nAnd then the story quoted the plaintiff, Samantha Elauf: \u201cI was born in the United States, and I thought I was the same as everyone else.\u201d\nShe seems like a heroine, but that was inauthentic litigant-speak that made me harrumph.

Bush and as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nApril 25, 2015\nWhether comprised of Article III judges or constituted as a specialized court within the executive branch, a drone court raises serious constitutional problems. Designing a drone court in a manner that respects executive power over military operations as well as the independence of the judiciary would be difficult, if not impossible.\nMoreover, from a public policy standpoint, it is unlikely that any drone court could address the concerns most frequently identified with targeted killings. Assuming for the sake of argument the validity of such concerns, these problems require political, not judicial, solutions.\nLegal authority. Concerns have been raised about the president\u2019s legal authority to engage in targeted killings, particularly against American citizens. A drone court does nothing to address this concern, as almost by definition, such a court would presume authority for lethal actions, evaluating and approving drone operations in specific circumstances. Substantive concerns about legal authority must be addressed by Congress in response to evolving security threats.\nAccountability. Many have argued for greater transparency and oversight of the drone program. Yet the proceedings of drone courts will, by necessity, be secret. Public accountability is far more likely to come from Congress, which can oversee and review the targeted killing program in a manner that airs political concerns and respects the national security interests at stake.\nDue process. Whether or not a drone court could provide due process depends on some understanding of what process is due in these circumstances. One should view with skepticism the Obama administration\u2019s assertion, in a Department of Justice white paper, that due process is satisfied \u201cwhere an informed, high-level official of the U.S. government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat.\u201d\nNonetheless, a drone court will be unable to provide the type of due process usually associated with federal courts, in part because these would likely be ex parte hearings (in which the government appears without any adversarial process). Furthermore, experience (such as with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) suggests secret and specialized courts face significant pressure to approve executive branch action. A judicial rubber stamp serves little purpose and may in fact undermine other forms of review and accountability.\nThe modern tendency is to view judicial checks as the primary, even exclusive, means of accountability. The Constitution, however, provides a variety of other checks. In the area of armed conflict and war powers, a deliberative and serious Congress provides the best hope for promoting an effective and accountable executive.\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Ray Odierno, said that because of budget cuts, only two of the Army\u2019s 42 combat brigades were ready for battle. In November, he warned members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that if the nation had to fight in the near term, \u201cit is unlikely that the Army would be able to defeat an adversary quickly and decisively.\u201d\nSuch warnings have become common around Washington in the wake of the deep cuts to the Pentagon budget this year, and the likelihood of another round of reductions next year. Last month, for instance, Republicans on the House Armed Services Committee warned that sequestration and other budget reductions \u201cwill bring our military to a force so small that a reassessment of our national security strategy will be required.\u201d\nBut not everyone subscribes to the dire talk.\nLast month, a group of retired senior-ranking officers argued before a packed audience at the Capitol Hill Club that despite the near certainty of shrinking military budgets, there are ways to trim the Defense Department\u2019s spending without leaving the armed forces less-than-ready for combat. Their plan, they contend, could reduce the overall size of the military while actually increasing its combat power. And in doing so, it will support Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel\u2019s call to revamp the military so that it remains sufficiently strong \u201cunder a cloud of budget restraints and uncertainty.\u201d\nUnder the auspices of the Mitchell Institute, a nonprofit policy group founded by the Air Force Association, representatives of the Army, Air Force, and Navy presented a reorganization plan called the Macgregor Transformation Model. The plan is named after its architect, Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army colonel who is the author of several books on reorganizing the military and also a decorated combat veteran. Mr. Macgregor says his plan can produce an increase in combat capability, even with smaller budgets.\nIn an August essay in The National Interest, two retired officers, Adm. Mark Fitzgerald and Lt. Gen. David Deptula, along with a West Point history professor, Col. Gian Gentile, described the Macgregor Transformation Model as \u201ca comprehensive Department of Defense-wide reform plan.\u201d The core of that plan, they said, would be reorganizing the Army and Marines combat forces into \u201cplug-and-play\u201d modules \u2014 that is, battle groups capable of deploying immediately for just about any contingency, without support units. The authors said that the plan had been recently updated to account for the president\u2019s 2012 decision to focus more resources on Asia, as well as to the reality of reduced federal budgets. The model, they concluded, \u201cenables the Army in particular to reduce its overall size yet increase its combat power and strategic flexibility.\u201d\nAt last month\u2019s Capitol Hill Club event, Mr. Macgregor said those deployable units, which he called \u201cCombat Groups,\u201d would replace the current brigade-centric system of organizing forces now. Combat Groups would include the major elements of fighting forces \u2014 maneuver, strike, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and sustainment units \u2013 making them self-sustaining forces that could still, as he put it, \u201cpunch above their weight.\u201d\nMr. Macgregor also calls for shedding unnecessary or redundant personnel, reducing the layers of command while increasing the percentage of formations dedicated to war-fighting. He would, for instance, eliminate two-star division headquarters (whose function would be assumed by a smaller number of three-star Joint Task Force headquarters), reduce Combatant Commands to five from the current seven, and consolidate three different four-star headquarters (Training and Doctrine Command; Forces Command; and Army Materiel Command) into two three-star headquarters. The plan would also have a slightly smaller institutional Army than the one we have now by converting selected nondeploying positions from uniform to civilian jobs. All of these changes would be aimed at shortening the \u201ctail\u201d that supports the fighting force, while growing the \u201cteeth.\u201d\nAs a result, the plan\u2019s supporters say, even at reduced budget levels, the Army would be able to field a greater number of combat battalions than it fielded in 2010, before reductions began. They estimated that even with 150,000 fewer troops, the reorganized Army could field an armored force containing almost 500 more tanks than during its peak year of 2010. A similar gain was projected for artillery, infantry, aviation and engineer units. All told, they say, the Army could reduce its current size of approximately 551,000 troops to as low as 420,000 without losing effectiveness. And more of those troops, they say, will be ready for deployment than is currently the case.\nIn his opening remarks at last month\u2019s session, General Deptula, who is dean of the Mitchell Institute, said the Defense Department\u2019s force structure had existed in its current form since 1942. \u201cThe time has arrived,\u201d he said, \u201cto reform and reorganize the Department of Defense toward joint operations in both word and deed. When a single service attempts to achieve war-fighting independence instead of embracing interdependence, jointness unravels and war-fighting effectiveness is reduced.\u201d\nOf course, a change as significant as the Macgregor model is likely to have its share of detractors both in the Pentagon and Congress. So far, the Pentagon seems to be silent on the plan. But two people in the audience at the Mitchell Institute event, one a liberal, the other a conservative, told me the ideas in the model are gaining traction among congressional staffers from both parties, spurred by the likelihood of new spending cuts.\n\u201cNational defense isn\u2019t a partisan issue,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is an American issue.\u201d\nDaniel L. Davis is an active duty lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, stationed in the Washington, D.C. region. He has deployed into combat zones four times, and was awarded the Bronze Star for valor during Desert Storm and a Bronze Star in Afghanistan.\nThe views in this article are those of the author alone and do not represent the views of the Department of the Army or Department of Defense.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

He is a co-founder of the Delaware Council for Global and Muslim Affairs and is on Twitter.\nUpdated December 6, 2015, 11:09 PM\nHow can we wrap our minds around the perverse appeal of ISIS to youth growing up in modern, liberal and democratic societies of the West? What is it that compels a young woman in Paris or a well-established young professional in California to eschew the fruits of modernity and liberalism, to join a radical movement that is so brutal and inhuman that even Al Qaeda finds it repellent?\nAccording to some, these youth have embraced an ideology, a radicalized interpretation of Islam, that teaches gratuitous violence against unbelievers. Their policy solutions \u2014 profiling Muslims, making a registry of all Muslim-American, closing mosques, etc. \u2014 seem as arbitrary as the violence.\nOthers argue that when Muslim youth in the West -- who are experiencing racism, Islamophobia and socio-economic marginalization or already alienated from their home communities -- see a movement that is fighting Western imperialism, such as support for Israel and invasion of Iraq, they run to join it in the hope that they will earn victory in this world and in the next.\nFinding real policy solutions won't work until we subject modernity to a fundamental scrutiny. Why are youth in the West, where there are religious and political freedoms, equality and economic opportunity, turning away? The key question here is not what is the appeal of ISIS but rather why has the American dream and the promise of Western liberalism lost its appeal?\nThe answer is that modernity promises much more than it delivers and hence ultimately engenders disenchantment.\nMuslims were told that if they embraced modernity they would become free and prosperous. But modernity has failed many Muslims in the Muslim World. It brought imperialism, occupation, wars, division and soul stifling oppression by home states and foreign powers. Today the most important element of modernity, the modern state, is crumbling across the Arab World, precipitating chaos and forcing Muslims to seek refuge abroad.\nFor Muslims in the West, unjust foreign policies of their new homes, persistent and virulent Islamophobia, state surveillance, discrimination and demonization can be at best alienating and at worst radicalizing. Perhaps it is those whom modernity has failed at home and abroad who are tempted by the fatal attraction of extremism.\nBut why Muslims only you might ask? My answer: Open your eyes and look, modernity is failing non-Muslims too. Egregious income inequalities, police brutality, rampant institutionalized racism, mass-killings, drugs, gang violence, sexual predatory behaviors, militarization of police, diminishing civil rights as the state becomes more intrusive and rising rhetoric of intolerance from mainstream politicians \u2014 they are symptoms of institutional failures, extremism and even domestic terrorism.\nWe can combat extremism only by recognizing and resisting it everywhere.

Wu Shengli,\nthe commander of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, conducted a survey of five islands in the disputed Spratly archipelago last month. Calling the trip \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Mr. Lee said\nthat Admiral Wu had made the weeklong trip on a military ship in order to inspect the land reclamation work that China has been conducting on the islands in recent months, according to Takungpao,\na Hong Kong newspaper.\nTakungpao, as well as the Taiwan-based United Daily News, also reported Mr. Lee as saying that President Xi Jinping of China had personally approved the reclamation work, which alarmed Southeast Asian nations that also claim sovereignty over the Spratly Island group when it was revealed earlier this year. Using a dredging vessel, China has been slowly turning several reefs into islands. Other claimants fear that Beijing wants to build military facilities on these land features, including an air base, in order to strengthen its claims.\nThe media reports did not identify all the South China Sea islands Mr. Lee was referring to, but, citing government reports, The Philippine Star reported last summer that China was carrying out reclamation activities on five reefs of the Spratly Islands that the Philippines also claims.\nMr. Lee\u2019s comments, which were also reported on the website of the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times but whose substance has not been formally confirmed by Beijing, are likely to set off new concerns about China\u2019s territorial aspirations in the South China Sea.\nAt a regional security conference in May, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel of the United States leveled a rare, pointed criticism at China for what he called \u201cdestabilizing, unilateral actions\u201d in asserting its territorial claims in the South China Sea, including \u201cland reclamation activities at multiple locations.\u201d\nBut it now appears that China has shrugged off these critiques and is intent on consolidating its territorial claims in the potentially resource-rich waters, through which around half of the world\u2019s freight cargo passes.\nChina claims a large swath of the South China Sea, represented by a nine-dash line drawn from a Nationalist Chinese map in 1947. At its southernmost point, Beijing\u2019s claim extends hundreds of miles from the Chinese mainland, nearly reaching the coastline of several Southeast Asian countries. The Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Malaysia each claim parts of the sea, and the claims of Taiwan, to which the Nationalist forces retreated after their defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949, echo those of Beijing.\nMr. Lee\u2019s comments came as Taipei is seeking to fortify its own claims in the sea with new military facilities. Reuters reported on Thursday that Taiwan is considering bolstering its military presence in the South China Sea by stationing ships permanently near disputed islands. The self-governing island, over which Beijing also claims sovereignty, is constructing a $100 million dollar port on Taiping Island in the Spratlys, where it already maintains an airstrip. Set to be completed next year, the port will allow the Taipei-controlled island to host 3,000-ton military and coast guard vessels.\nAt the meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Lee also said that Admiral Wu had overseen Chinese troop drills at Yongshu Island in the Spratly archipelago. Internationally known as Fiery Cross Reef, the site is about 740 nautical miles south of the Chinese mainland and serves as the administrative and military headquarters of China\u2019s Spratly Island claims. It is home to about 100 troops.\nDespite the criticism, it seems that China has continued to assert its claims through what some analysts have dubbed a \u201csalami-slicing\u201d approach, even as it calls for talks on joint development of the seas and says navigational safety will not be threatened. Earlier this year, the Chinese government said it would offer financial subsidies to fishermen who live in the Spratly and Paracel islands of the South China Sea.\nLast spring, protests broke out in several cities in Vietnam after China deployed a deep-water oil-drilling platform near an island grouping off Vietnam\u2019s coast that is controlled by China but claimed by Vietnam.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The video, complete with ominous soundtrack, warns instead that such visits are intended to corrupt Chinese officers.\nThe strikingly hard-line film, titled \u201cSilent Contest\u201d (\u8f83\u91cf\u65e0\u58f0), also takes aim at Western nongovernmental organizations, the American and British consulates in Hong Kong, and\nprominent reformers inside China. It accuses Washington of sponsoring exiled minority leaders such as the Dalai Lama and the Uighur dissident Rebiya Kadeer.\nIt is not clear if the video was intentionally released online or somehow leaked, but it began disappearing from Chinese websites on Thursday night. Its heavy ideological content and propaganda style suggest it may have been produced to support the work of the military\u2019s political commissars, who are charged with the ideological indoctrination of troops and maintaining their morale, discipline and loyalty. As such, the film appears to offer a remarkably straightforward glimpse into the Cold War mind-set of the Chinese military leadership, as well as the deep suspicions of the United States festering inside one of the most influential institutions in the Chinese political system.\nCutting from crude graphics of American dollar bills to standard shots of the Statue of Liberty to blurry footage of American leaders from George Washington to President Obama, the video bemoans the fall of the Soviet Union and warns that China faces a similar fate if it fails to counter Washington\u2019s nefarious efforts to infiltrate Chinese society.\nThe General Staff Department of the People\u2019s Liberation Army is listed as a producer of the film, along with the army\u2019s National Defense University and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nThe university\u2019s president, Wang Xibin, a lieutenant general, appears on camera describing how the United States grooms \u201cfriendly forces, so-called democratic forces,\u201d inside China and on the \u201cexterior goes against the party\u2019s absolute control of the army.\u201d He also criticizes visits by American and Chinese military officials to the other\u2019s country, saying that the exchanges will increasingly be used by the United States for \u201cinfiltration.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to take careful precaution and look out for the smallest detail, and build a strong political and ideological line of defense,\u201d General Wang says.\nThe United States has long urged reluctant Chinese leaders to increase the number of military exchanges, arguing that such visits yield transparency and trust. In recent months, several top Pentagon officers have traveled to China or hosted visits by their Chinese counterparts, a flurry that Washington has described as progress.\nThe version of the film available online Thursday was undated, but it contained footage of President Xi Jinping after he took office in March. It makes no mention of Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor with the National Security Agency whose leaks in June about the scale of Washington\u2019s global surveillance presented the Chinese with a propaganda windfall.\nThe video singles out villains in both China and the United States.\nIn China, nearly a dozen people \u2014 scholars, lawyers, disgraced military personnel and dismissed journalists \u2014 are accused of having been compromised by the United States. In some cases, lines in their writings are shown and underlined for emphasis. Among those tarred are Mao Yushi, 84, a liberal economist who was awarded the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty at a ceremony in Washington last year, and He Weifang, a prominent law professor at Peking University and an advocate for judicial reform.\nOn the American side, the video goes after nongovernmental organizations, including the Carter Center, the Asia Foundation, the International Republican Institute and the Ford Foundation. \u201cNongovernmental organizations are the soft tentacles of Western countries displaying the will of their nation,\u201d the narrator intones. The Fulbright program, which has promoted cultural exchanges between the United States and other countries since the late 1940s, is called an instrument for \u201cAmerica\u2019s cultural invasion.\u201d\nThe video takes exception to local officials who visited the United States in 2004 to look at the election process as guests of the Carter Center, complaining that the participants were part of \u201ca very meticulous plan\u201d for what the Americans wanted to achieve in China. Sounding alarmed, the narrator points out that one official returned from the visit and wrote a blog post arguing that elections were the legitimate way for a government to gain power in a country.\nThe film depicts the United States and British consulates in Hong Kong as nests of spies, without actually using the word. \u201cA lot of information suggests that the functions of the two consulates extend to more than what is described on paper,\u201d the narrator says, noting that the consulates together employ more than 900 staff members and accusing them of supporting \u201csubversive\u201d pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong.\nA spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing had no comment on the film.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Is there any evidence it was for #ukriots?\nJudicial advocates also objected to the stiff punishments, which were handed out in many cases to first-time offenders. \u201cWhen people get caught up and act out of character, in a similar way, there is a danger that the courts themselves may get caught up in a different kind of collective hysteria,\u201d Paul Mendelle, former chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, told the BBC. \u201cIn purporting to reflect the public mood,\u201d he said, courts \u201cactually go over the top and hand out sentences which are too long and too harsh.\u201d\nIn an interview with the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles, a Labour Party member accused Mr. Cameron of fundamentally misunderstanding new technology, seeing social media sites like Twitter and Facebook and instant message services like BlackBerry\u2019s BBM only as organizing tools for mayhem. \u201cHis reaction shows that he has trouble distinguishing the message from the medium,\u201d the member, Chi Onwurah, said.\nThe same message can be heard from social media observers and others online who, in an appropriation of the National Rifle Association\u2019s favorite saying, have said that it\u2019s the people, not the social media platforms, doing the organizing.\nSocial media doesn\u2019t organize riots. People organize riots.\nHowever, it\u2019s a point Mr. Cameron would likely endorse as it seems to underscore the importance of punishing those individual people who use social media in violation of the law. (Incitement \u2014 even on social media \u2014 is illegal in Britain, as The Lede has written before.)\nWhile many focused on punishments, Cory Doctrow, a Canadian journalist and the editor of Boing Boing, wrote in The Guardian of the failure of Britain\u2019s widespread closed-circuit cameras to prevent mobs from gathering and committing crimes to begin with.\nBut for me, the use of BlackBerrys in organizing riots (if \u201corganise\u201d is the correct verb here) is just a sideshow. Though as a Canadian, I\u2019m fascinated to see that our national technology success story, the businesslike BlackBerry, has now enduringly entered pop culture\u2019s lexicon as the tool of choice for disaffected and violent youth.\nThe real story for me is about surveillance, and not the mere use of CCTV footage to apprehend rioters after the fact. It\u2019s about the total failure of CCTV to deter people from committing crimes in the first place.\nIndeed, cameras that captured brazen criminality, including a vehicular attack on London police, have been used to try to apprehend offenders but certainly did not stop the crimes from occurring.\nSimilarly, in Maryland, the police published video of a brazen \u201cflash mob\u201d looting a local 7-Eleven.\nCNN reported that police believe the group of at least 28 people was organized online. The cameras were no deterrent, but are being used to identify suspects. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a lot of response from sources in the community who have seen the video, who are concerned, and are calling police with tips,\u201d Capt. Paul Starks told CNN.\nOne preventative measure that does appear, for the moment, to be working against criminal gangs organized online: a curfew in Philadelphia meant to halt a wave of flash mobs in the city\u2019s center.\nNone were reported over the past weekend, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported, though just outside of it, a girl who had attended an antiviolence party was stabbed.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Meet the man in Man United. More\u2026\nEven the hard men of Manchester United scrub up nicely for a fashion shoot in T: The New York Times Style Magazine. But behind every renowned player are years of blood, sweat and tears in training. United\u2019s history is a blend of talents hired from around the globe, joined with schoolboys raised to play with the attacking brio that characterizes the team.\nThe work toward this end takes place in secret at the Carrington training complex on the outskirts of Manchester. It is entered by a single-track road and guarded day and night by electronic surveillance, high wire fencing and 30,000 trees. The locals know it as \u201cFortress Carrington.\u201d David Sebbah, T\u2019s creative director, was allowed inside, as he traveled the globe with the photographer Max Vadukul in pursuit of portraits of the players and coaches.\nHoused inside two hangar-like buildings, the facility serves as a living museum to players past and present. They are the chosen ones, set on course by the club manager Matt Busby, between 1945 and 1971, and by Alex Ferguson, his successor since November 1986. Both are Scots, and both were knighted by the British monarch.\nBusby oversaw the rebuilding of United\u2019s Old Trafford stadium into a modern arena that attracts crowds up to 76,000 strong. In contrast, he established a training setup in a place known as the Cliff, away from the public glare and the spying of opponents. Busby\u2019s greatest triumph was to build it all from the ground up, and then rebuild it again after his team, the Busby Babes, was destroyed in a plane crash that almost killed him.\nFerguson is imbued with a similar, if more aggressive, spirit, and works from dawn to dusk at Carrington, the \u201cnew\u201d training camp that opened 11 years ago. Surrounded by 1.5 miles of fencing, entered by players in their Ferraris and by the 200 employees who teach, care for and watch over them, Carrington is the laboratory striving to maintain traditions.\nThe facility has a medical center, lounges, study rooms, offices, squash courts, a basketball area, rehabilitation facilities and even the Manchester United TV studio. Old Trafford may be \u201cThe Theatre of Dreams\u201d where championships are won, but Carrington, part farm and part workhouse, is the stealth enabler behind those dreams. No one enters Carrington without the permission of Sir Alex. And no one leaves until they pass his tests of workmanship or are shown the exit.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Normal Bob, whose given name is Bob Hain, says peepers are a constant presence in the south section of the park, where they prey on women wearing skirts who sit on the sets of steps along 14th Street.\nFor years, Mr. Hain, 42, a graphic artist who lives in Bushwick, has been peeping at the peepers: shooting pictures and video footage of the surreptitious gawkers to post on his site, along with detailed analyses of the strategies they use to steal glances while seeming to blend in with pedestrians.\nSeveral months ago, Mr. Hain\u2019s collection of peeper chronicles caught the attention of producers from \u201cInside Edition,\u201d and now the program is broadcasting an investigation of the peepers on Monday at noon on WNYW, Channel 5, in New York City.\nIn August, \u201cInside Edition\u201d sent a team of people with hidden cameras to stake out the regular peeping sections. They shot footage of a handful of men who looked \u2014 often for hours at a time \u2014 under the skirts of women on the steps, said Larry Posner, a producer of the segment.\n\u201cIt was shocking to learn how prevalent it was in the park,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cWe had heard about it, but to see it day in and day out, our staffers were equally disgusted.\u201d\nOne member of the team shot footage from the second-story eating area of the Whole Foods that overlooks the park on 14th Street. Another videotaped the peepers head-on, from a vantage point past the women, with a third staff member roaming behind the peepers, to see if they were taking pictures of the women \u2014 many were, Mr. Posner said. Hidden cameras were used to film the segment.\nThe program also put two young female researchers on the steps dressed in short skirts \u2014 with shorts underneath \u2014 and using cameras tucked in their purses to shoot the peepers.\n\u201cI think people will watch and say, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is going on,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cUnless the girls are really looking for it, they\u2019d never know.\u201d\nMr. Posner said the team did not contact the police about the peepers they investigated, but he added, \u201cWe hope by showing this, we\u2019ll bring awareness to this issue and action will be taken.\u201d\nMr. Posner said he or the on-air correspondent for the segment, Lisa Guerrero, would typically confront a peeper once it was established that the person was photographing women. The segment shows them confronting three men on-camera, each of whom denied he was peeping, he said.\nMr. Posner said his research of court papers showed two arrests in recent months for illegal surveillance in the Union Square area.\nPeeper arrests are rare in New York City public spaces because simply trying to look under the skirts of women is not a crime. Voyeurism is illegal when the subject is unaware and the image is recorded on camera.\nIn 2007, Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr. introduced a bill in the City Council that would prohibit peeping in public places such as parks and subways, but civil rights groups have objected to such laws.\n\u201cInside Edition\u201d came away with plenty of footage of Mr. Hain\u2019s regular peepers, including Preppy Peeper (who dresses in preppy clothes) and Portrait Peeper (he leers while pretending to paint portraits).\nMr. Hain helped producers identify the peeping styles, how to distinguish \u201ctandem-style peeping,\u201d for instance, from \u201cfront row peeping.\u201d He has been holding forth on these and other details of the peepers on the \u201cMethods of a Peeper\u201d videos \u2014 \u201cthe behavior and science behind the Union Square Peeper\u201d \u2014 on his site, laying out various practices and providing detailed diagrams of peeper strategies and preferred sight lines.\nLast Thursday, Mr. Hain was in his usual spot in the park, on the steps near 14th Street and Park Avenue. He pointed out the current group of peepers in front of him: a man in work boots and a polo shirt; another man who had a mullet haircut and was wearing a dark T-shirt; and a short man wearing a white T shirt.\n\u201cThese guys are regulars,\u201d Mr. Hain said. \u201cThe guy in the polo shirt is pretending to be on the phone \u2014 he\u2019ll stand like that for hours. The short guy is Mini-Peeper. For some reason, because of his size, he doesn\u2019t get noticed as easily and gets real close.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Residents of both housing complexes said there had been a running feud between the projects for years, and that fights among young residents had increased before the shooting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a senseless beef and it goes back before I was born,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cI remember growing up with it in the \u201990s. Things were escalating the last couple weeks and these guys came here to hurt a Grant person, didn\u2019t matter who it was. And now this is going to make it worse.\u201d\nPolice officials also said the shooting might have been connected to the dispute between the projects.\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid stuff; these two groups don\u2019t even know each other,\u201d said Krisy Reyes, 18, a friend of Ms. Murphy\u2019s. \u201cAll they knew was, \u2018We\u2019re Manhattanville, they\u2019re Grant. So they\u2019re the enemy.\u2019\u201d\nManny Cerrutty, 42, another longtime resident of the Grant Houses, stared at the makeshift shrine Ms. Murphy\u2019s friends had made, with hundreds of handwritten messages scrawled on a bedsheet duct-taped to the building\u2019s facade. On the ground were more than 100 candles, and empty bottles of liquor, apparently consumed in tribute.\n\u201cThey killed Grant\u2019s star,\u201d Mr. Cerrutty said. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to start back up now.\u201d\nSeveral teenagers sitting on a railing nearby, agreed, and perhaps indulged in a bit of bravado.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be bodies dropping in the \u2018Ville now, for real,\u201d one said, referring to the Manhattanville Houses.\nMs. Murphy, who was known as Chicken, lived in a 15th-floor apartment at 3170 Broadway. She moved to the Grant Houses five years ago with her mother and two brothers.\nThere, she developed into a high school basketball star, playing competitive games on the projects\u2019 courts and in tournaments in summer. She also practiced her dribbling incessantly in front of the building, in between dancing and holding court among groups of friends.\nOn Sunday, police officials and neighbors said, Ms. Murphy was in a group of young people outside the Grant Houses when some men walked up to them on a short walkway from Broadway. The Grant group scattered and Ms. Murphy fled into her building and ran up the stairs. She was shot several times in a stairwell on a fourth-floor landing; her blood remained on the wall on Wednesday. Nearby walls were covered with graffiti tributes.\nThe police said three men were captured on surveillance cameras approaching Ms. Murphy\u2019s building carrying guns. On Tuesday, the police announced that one of them, Terique Collins, 24, had been arrested in the Manhattanville Houses and charged with weapons possession. The police identified the other two suspects as Tyshawn Brockington, 21, and Robert Cartagena, 20, but did not provide information on Wednesday about where they lived.\nMs. Murphy began playing basketball at age 5 \u2013 usually with boys \u2013 while growing up in the Queensbridge Houses in Long Island City, Queens. She was ranked on an ESPN Web site as the nation\u2019s 16th-best point guard in her class, and was starting her senior year at Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers, a New York City basketball powerhouse.\nMs. Murphy was known for her ball-handling and her ability to drive hard to the hoop, but she also enjoyed a sometimes raucous social life outside her building, friends said.\nSome of Ms. Murphy\u2019s friends insisted that she was not involved in any rivalry between the projects. But others said that she, or her 17-year-old brother, known as Bam-Bam \u2013 might have been involved in a fight the night before the shooting. (Ms. Murphy and her brother were strikingly similar in appearance.)\nOn Saturday night, some said, a young man from the Manhattanville Houses was beaten and slammed over the head with a bicycle outside the C-Town supermarket, on 125th Street on the edge of the Grant Houses. Her killing, several hours later, was retribution, they said.\nFeuds between nearby housing projects are not uncommon. There have been longstanding, recurring rivalries among complexes in the Rockaways, including Beach 41st Street Houses, the Ocean Bay Houses and Ocean Village.\n\u201cIt\u2019s common, the feuds, but Chicken was only involved in basketball, nothing else,\u201d said Zanobia Rivera, 18, who described herself as Ms. Murphy\u2019s girlfriend.\nMs. Rivera, a senior at the Global Learning Collective school in Manhattan, was standing by the shrine for Ms. Murphy, clutching a pair of her red basketball shorts.\nIn the Manhattanville Houses, a young couple pushing their baby in a stroller said there had been constant fights between groups of young men from the two projects in recent weeks.\n\u201cThey learn this stupidity at a young age,\u201d said the mother, who would not give her name for fear of retribution. \u201cMy little brother just started seventh grade at the local school, which has mostly Manhattanville kids. They\u2019ve already started bullying him, asking him, \u2018You from Grant, huh? You from Grant?\u2019 Where do they learn this?\u201d\nNear the shrine, Mr. Spencer, a fledgling rapper known as Babyface, said, \u201cThe only thing we can do is try to stop the violence because violence ain\u2019t going to bring Chicken back.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Did these shows deserve their fates, for better or worse? Speaking of comedies, HBO unveiled \u201cEnlightened\u201d and came back with a new season of \u201cBored to Death\u201d and a male breast-feeding scene. Has HBO finally gone too far? The television critics Mike Hale and Neil Genzlinger have posted answers to your questions and comments.\nHomeland with time brought up to date,\nOwes to Manchurian candidate?\nIs the theme tired,\nAnd hardly inspired?\nProduction and cast are first rate.\n\u2014 Larry Eisenberg, New York City\nNeil Genzlinger: Picture Carrie enjoying a shower,\nWhen who should walk in but Jack Bauer?\nHe\u2019s been unemployed,\nNow he\u2019s newly deployed\nFor a terror-fighting cross-over hour.\nMike Hale: I thought about answering in limerick form, but I can\u2019t come up with any rhymes for Sinatra or Frankenheimer. I certainly don\u2019t hold it against \u201cHomeland\u201d that it owes a debt to \u201cThe Manchurian Candidate\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s consciously drawing parallels between our current political and cultural situation and the early days of the Cold War, something that one of its consulting producers, Henry Bromell, is very adept at. And there are plenty of differences in the way the story is being told. I think the big question is how long they can string out the mystery regarding the Damian Lewis character\u2019s real feelings without having it get silly.\nI thought the pilot of \u2018New Girl\u2019 was one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever seen on TV. I continued to watch because of the wide acclaim and the subsequent episodes were better; but I\u2019m still not convinced. I like Zooey Deschanel and the basic premise of the show; but I really can\u2019t embrace the other actors and/or their characters. To say they are two-dimensional is probably being too complimentary. And the \u2018jokes\u2019 are mostly very tired re-treads. \u2014 Larry, The Fifth Circle\nNeil Genzlinger: Yes, there\u2019s certainly a lot of retreading going around this fall, especially in the comedies. And a lot of two-dimensionality. I think you\u2019ve hit on something. The great comedies of the past had characters who were well-enough developed that they could take a detour away from slapstick and into something serious, and the audience would follow. The Edith Bunker cancer episode of \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d for instance. Hard to imagine most of the fall newcomers pulling that off, though of course it\u2019s early yet.\nMike Hale: Oh, there have been much worse things on television than the \u201cNew Girl\u201d pilot. That said, I agree with your basic premise and have been saying so every chance I get: there\u2019s nothing to the show beyond Zooey Deschanel\u2019s charm and timing, and if they don\u2019t do something about that it\u2019s going to get old really fast. I\u2019ve had this discussion face to face several times \u2014 when I tell people, look, the writing is flat and none of the three guys is funny, they just plant their feet and shake their heads, because they\u2019re so desperate to like the show.\nI\u2019ve been watching The New Girl, 2 Broke Girls, and I watched Last Man Standing last night. The New Girl is a little wanna-be Tina Fey and trite but it\u2019s cute. Last Man Standing was exactly what you expect: Home Improvement done over (thus entertaining). \u2026 It\u2019s sad that Kat Dennings (who is hilarious) is on a show that has such a stereotypical asian character, pretty offensive- resembling Long Duck Dong from Sixteen Candles (when it was still okay to not be at least a little bit PC). It\u2019s too bad because the show had a lot of potential! \u2014 Stephanie, Minneapolis\nMike Hale: This is the price we pay for not protesting the character Ken Jeong plays in the \u201cHangover\u201d movies and, to a lesser extent, his Senor Chang in \u201cCommunity.\u201d As you laugh, so shall you reap.\nNeil Genzlinger: Can\u2019t go along with your suggestion that \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d is entertaining. Or that it\u2019s \u201cHome Improvement\u201d done over. It\u2019s a sort of reverse-\u201cTerra Nova\u201d of \u201cHome Improvement\u201d: some of the more Neanderthalic elements of that ancient show (which were funny in the original context) have been transplanted into the now, but somehow the wit and chemistry between cast members did not make it through the portal.\nNBC does not seem to be improving in the wake of the Comcast takeover. THE PLAYBOY CLUB and FREE AGENTS have already bitten the dust, and though they\u2019ve just ordered more scripts for both PRIME SUSPECT and HARRY\u2019S LAW, neither is exactly blowing the roof off the ratings. Thoughts? \u2014 MockingbirdGirl, USA\nMike Hale: It\u2019s worth remembering that Robert Greenblatt didn\u2019t take over as head of entertainment programming for NBC until March, after the merger had been completed, by which time it was too late for him to be involved in developing any of this fall\u2019s shows. His imprint won\u2019t really be seen until next year. And I don\u2019t think the season will be a complete loss: \u201cPrime Suspect\u201d may turn out to be a pretty good show. Whether the ratings will reflect that, who knows. We\u2019re just critics.\nNeil Genzlinger: I agree with Mike that \u201cPrime Suspect\u201d is becoming a pretty good show now that it\u2019s slowly moving past the creaky old woman-in-a-man\u2019s-world stuff. I could see Maria Bello getting an Emmy nomination if the show sticks around. She was pretty funny in the most recent episode, self-consciously trying to soften her rough edges.\nConsidering what HBO has served up over the years, surely you\u2019re joking about male breast-feeding being \u201ctoo far\u201d. \u2014 BooksAboutMovies, Toronto, Ontario\nMike Hale: I think we were joking about that. It\u2019s been a few weeks since I watched those \u201cBored to Death\u201d episodes, but if I\u2019m remembering correctly, you don\u2019t actually see Zach Galifianakis\u2019s nipples, or at least you don\u2019t see them in the vicinity of the baby. It\u2019s probably more subversive when his character, Ray, goes to Prospect Park and tries to talk mothers there into nursing the baby for him.\nNeil Genzlinger: Um, yes, we\u2019re joking about the shocking, SHOCKING! male breast-feeding scene. But I can spin a serious point out of that if you want. Here\u2019s why \u201cBored to Death\u201d and shows like \u201cThe League\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d on FX are funny where so many of new prime-time comedies aren\u2019t. When they do something absurdly outrageous \u2014 male breast-feeding, painting a swastika on your street so the city will finally come fill in that pothole at the end of your driveway in order to cover up the graffiti (a joke from \u201cThe League\u201d) \u2014 they\u2019re doing it organically, and with their audience as co-conspirators. Whereas when Whitney or Kat or whoever on the new shows makes some penis reference, it\u2019s with a big neon sign: \u201cHey, I just said \u2018penis\u2019 on prime-time television! Aren\u2019t I cutting-edge?\u201d\nWhat series do you sense may be on its last legs excluding those already being promoted as the last season (e.g., Desperate Housewives)? What is the one show no one\u2019s watching and should? \u2014 BodegaVendetta, NYC\nMike Hale: This may be too easy of an answer, but it looks like it\u2019s going to be an uphill climb for \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d without Christopher Meloni and with less of Mariska Hargitay (if that actually happens). On your second question, I think there are two shows up against each other on Friday nights that deserve bigger audiences than they have, though both have done well enough to ensure their continued survival: \u201cFringe\u201d on Fox and \u201cSupernatural\u201d on CW. They\u2019re pigeonholed as shows for sci-fi/fantasy geeks, but they\u2019re better than a lot of crime or medical or family dramas that get more viewers.\nNeil Genzlinger: Maybe this is just wishful thinking on my part, but, on the reality side, it feels as if some shows that have wrung their gimmicks dry ought to die soon, just on general principles. \u201cJersey Shore,\u201d for instance. \u201cProject Runway.\u201d Probably both will live forever, because they have an established audience that seems unable to get enough of what they do, but I can\u2019t watch them anymore; they just feel to me as if they\u2019ve shown all their tricks. Yeah, I know, heresy. Here\u2019s another: \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d has been feeling spent to me for awhile now. Maybe it\u2019s time for someone new there?\nI\u2019ll stay on the reality side for Part 2 of the question: I continue to be a fan of \u201cThe Sing-Off\u201d on NBC and can\u2019t understand why so few people watch it while so many were willing to sit through the torture that was the first few weeks of \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d I guess some people still get a charge out of the phony audition drama and deliberately awful performances that \u201cThe X Factor\u201d trafficked in during its first weeks, but to me those audition episodes just seemed like one long cliche. (Now that the show has finally gotten through all that and is down to the real singers, though, I\u2019m actually looking forward to it, and was a bit bummed when it was bumped Wednesday night by baseball.) If your interest is just in the singing, the stuff being done on \u201cThe Sing-Off\u201d \u2014 on which NBC risked a big chunk of its Monday night this season \u2014 is much better and more sophisticated than what \u201cThe X Factor\u201d serves up.\nHow do you feel about the increasing number of laugh-less \u201cdramedies\u201d on cable \u2014 shows that arguably contain few if any genuine jokes? t\u2019s as if awkward squirming has replaced actual laughter as the intention for these series, and \u2018Enlightened\u2019 is yet another entry into a category filled with recent (or not so recent) arrivals like \u201cWilfred,\u201d \u201cLouie,\u201d \u201cHow to Make It in America,\u201d \u201cWeeds\u201d, \u201cBig C\u201d, \u201cWeb Therapy,\u201d etc. Personally, I like many of the shows I\u2019ve listed, but they\u2019re a far cry from the zany, classic(al) comedies that I grew up with. \u2014 MC, Los Angeles\nMike Hale: I like some of them too \u2014 I think \u201cLouie\u201d is one of the best shows on TV, and \u201cWeeds\u201d used to be pretty good. You may unconsciously be falling into the same way of thinking as the television academy, which puts all half-hour shows in the \u201ccomedy\u201d category at the Emmys, regardless of their content. There\u2019s nothing that says a show should be funny \u2014 or funny ha-ha, in any case \u2014 just because it\u2019s a half-hour long.\nNeil Genzlinger: The laughless comedy \u2014 an interesting phenomenon indeed. For shows like that, it\u2019s all about pitch. I couldn\u2019t quite latch onto \u201cEnlightened,\u201d though perhaps some people did. I got what it was aiming for, just didn\u2019t care. Whereas I love \u201cWilfred\u201d and \u201cWeb Therapy\u201d and some of the others. It\u2019s certainly a riskier type of comedy than the old laugh-track sitcom, so kudos to those who are offering these shows.\nI\u2019ve only seen Last Man Standing and Suburgatory and they are unwatchable. I\u2019m scared to check out the others. What gives? Why are these alleged comedies so lame? Seriously. \u2014 Ha, Boston\nMike Hale: And this is where we point out that the premiere of \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d drew nearly 13 million viewers at 8 p.m., with no lead-in, making it one of the strongest debuts of the new season. And it was especially strong in the 18-to-49 demographic. And viewership went up during the second half of the hourlong episode. So for now, at least, it\u2019s lame all the way to the bank.\nNeil Genzlinger: How this stuff gets on the air remains a mystery, but I suspect were we to go back through television coverage of the last 40 years, we\u2019d find that it\u2019s an annual mystery: every season, some clunkers inexplicably get onto the schedule. I also bet we\u2019d find that annually there\u2019s at least one show that is universally panned and yet draws an audience. Beats me why so many people watched \u201cLast Man Standing,\u201d but a lot of things that \u201cso many people\u201d do bewilder me \u2014 going to karaoke clubs, texting photos of their private parts, drinking water from a plastic bottle. I\u2019m the problem; I realize that.\nWhy is it that the networks\u2013through the long development process and their summer-long promotion of shows like Playboy Club\u2013can\u2019t (or won\u2019t?) see what is obvious to most viewers after one or two episodes? (That they are terrible). \u2014 Andrew, New York\nMike Hale: A lot of terrible shows do fine. Is \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d better than \u201cThe Playboy Club\u201d? No, it\u2019s worse. Among the new-season dramas, are \u201cUnforgettable\u201d or \u201cTerra Nova\u201d better than \u201cThe Playboy Club\u201d? Not by a whole lot, but they\u2019re both getting decent ratings. It\u2019s a terribly subjective business, and thank God for that, or we wouldn\u2019t have anything to write about.\nNeil Genzlinger: Whatever the process is, it certainly seems danged inefficient here in the age when, on a talent-competition show, the national preference can quickly be determined with a simple telephone poll. Gotta be a way to float an advance look at a show and ask the country, \u201cYou wanna see any more of this?\u201d Yeah, I know, it\u2019s expensive to make even a trailer for a new show. But still. It feels a bit like book publishing: Many books are still produced via a laborious publishing process that takes a year or more, but suddenly here we are in the age of e-readers and insta-books.\nI was disappointed in Harry\u2019s Law after the first episode but I stuck with it. The show seems to be smartly written, though a few of the sub plots are a bit of a drag. Last night it was a bummer to see one of the last of the original quirky cast members leave. Have you changed your opinion of the show recently? \u2014 Barry, Vermont\nNeil Genzlinger: \u201cHarry\u2019s Law\u201d certainly seems adrift somehow. I think it would be in danger of cancellation if it were on another network. NBC may need to keep it around just because of the other shows it has that are failing.\nFor some reason, to me, DANCING WITH THE STARS is feeling like a non-event, but what\u2019s clear is that the fan-base for pretty, sexy talented, musically gifted performers (like Chynna Phillips, whose upcoming Wilson Phillips reality show I\u2019m excited about) aren\u2019t sending people to the phone lines. No one\u2019s voting against them, I think, but people are deliberately voting for the quirky (and I count Ricki Lake as quirky). Do you have any predictions as to whether this season\u2019s demographic shift for the show is affecting it permanently, or is it just a one-time casting blip? \u2014 Freddie, New York City\nNeil Genzlinger: \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d feels \u201cover\u201d to me. There; I said it.\nI enjoy sf and horror. I did not enjoy the family friendly dino antics of Terra Nova. American Horror Story is another story. Delightfully creepy. Sick in a most entertaining fashion. \u2014 jjo, St. Pete, Fl.\nAmerican Horror Story, as uneven as it might be, seems to be one of the only shows playing with narrative and trying new things in storytelling. Think it will last? \u2014 Aaron, NYC\nMike Hale: I think it has a good chance, though you have to wonder what the budget is with all those well-known actors in the cast. (I assume Jessica Lange isn\u2019t working for scale.) It benefits from the lower ratings expectations of cable, but on the other hand FX hasn\u2019t been shy when it came to canceling prominent new dramas like \u201cTerriers\u201d and \u201cLights Out.\u201d I gave \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d a mixed review, tending toward negative, but I want to like it, because it\u2019s different and because I like watching Connie Britton and Denis O\u2019Hare and Ms. Lange. I\u2019m hoping it finds its stride.\nNeil Genzlinger: Interesting point that I hadn\u2019t registered before: With the new season we\u2019re getting the two extremes of sci-fi, the PG version and the almost-R version. I\u2019ve heard a number of people say they\u2019re disappointed in \u201cTerra Nova,\u201d but I have to confess I rather liked the most recent episode \u2014 pretty good plot premise, well-executed. For those who missed it, the Novians, or whatever they\u2019re called, were being afflicted by a virus that ate their memories and caused them to revert to an earlier point in their lives. As I was watching, I was also toggling back and forth to \u201cThe Sing-Off,\u201d where the groups were doing their own bit of time-regression: they were assigned to sing songs from the \u201960s.\nThe only new show i\u2019m making a point to watch is Revenge which is just escapist, nighttime soapy fun. I wish A Gifted Man was better \u2013 the casting is great but the stories are falling flat for me. \u2014 bridget212323, Los Angeles\nNeil Genzlinger: I\u2019m with you, Bridget: \u201cRevenge\u201d has become my favorite among the new shows. Yeah, it\u2019s soap-opera silly, but Emily VanCamp is beguiling (someone explain to me why she\u2019s billed below Madeleine Stowe?), and as it goes along it\u2019s developing some nice subplots. Nolan Ross (Gabriel Mann), Emily/Amanda\u2019s confidant, may be the most interesting character on any of the new shows.\nMike and Neil, looks like another poor start for NBC. Do they have anything more promising in the pipeline? And how patient will new overlords, Comcast, be with their in/near cellar-dwelling? CBS programming seems so tired, even with new offerings, yet they remain on top. This must be totally frustrating for programming heads at NBC, and elsewhere. What does NBC have to do to get back viewers? Thanks for your insights. \u2014 janwell, Wellesley, MA\nMike Hale: It\u2019s interesting that you mention the pipeline, because they have in fact saved a couple of their more interesting drama pilots for midseason: the crime drama \u201cAwake\u201d \u2014 a fractured-reality show somewhat along the lines of \u201cLife on Mars,\u201d this one starring Jason Isaacs \u2014 and the behind-the-scenes-of-a-Broadway-musical show \u201cSmash,\u201d with Debra Messing among many others. It\u2019s too early to say anything about them from a critical standpoint, but I think it\u2019s safe to say that \u201cSmash\u201d will get a lot of attention, at least in New York.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The section rumbles on for another 355 words, leaving you googly-eyed well before the end. (You\u2019ve got to love the part about the telegraph pole. Is there a crisis of telegraph-pole abuse in this city that we missed?)\nBut the point is plain: To use an old phrase, post no bills.\nThe warning is routinely violated. All sorts of material is taped to lampposts, whether by college students offering computer lessons or by families whose pets wander off. The Sanitation Department, which deals with these matters, isn\u2019t in the habit of handing summonses to disconsolate cat owners. \u201cWe have a heart,\u201d said Vito A. Turso, the chief department spokesman.\nThe municipal heart, however, does not go out to politicians who run afoul of Section 10-119 with their campaign posters. Election Day comes and goes. Winds blow. Rains fall. Posters become a sodden mess that slide to the ground. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to sweep it up,\u201d Mr. Turso said. That somebody is a sanitation worker. And so the department issues bushels of summonses to political campaigns, each ticket typically carrying a $75 fine.\nThis is not new. But the issue has resonance now because of questions raised about the city comptroller, John C. Liu, a man who would be mayor.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Liu\u2019s campaign finances were cast most unfavorably in an article in The New York Times that described a series of irregularities involving some of his donors. Interviewed by NY1 Wednesday night, he said that \u201cto the extent that there are discrepancies, we are going to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\nMr. Liu has another financial problem, though. The Sanitation Department says he owes the city more than $500,000, a result of 7,000 summonses for posters put up unlawfully when he ran for comptroller in 2009.\nHe is not alone in this regard. The previous comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., ran up more than $600,000 in sanitation fines in his 2009 race for mayor. The public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who is yet another would-be mayor, was good for $300,000 in tickets.\nFor the better part of two years, all three men refused to pay, challenging the validity of the fines. Two weeks ago, Mr. de Blasio finally agreed to settle. He didn\u2019t need the \u201cdistraction,\u201d he said. Presumably, he also didn\u2019t need being repeatedly cast as a deadbeat in the tabloids.\nBut Messrs. Liu and Thompson have dug in their heels. Mr. Liu, in particular, often finds himself a leading character in a Daily News editorial feature called \u201cWeasel Watch.\u201d\nThe struggle over tickets is a pettifogger\u2019s dream: Were summonses mailed to the correct campaign official? Was the postage right? Were the ticket numbers properly recorded?\nThere are also whispers within the Liu camp that City Hall may have had a hand in seeking substantial fines. Not that the mayor\u2019s campaigns have been above putting up plenty of their own illegal posters. But they have a billionaire\u2019s bank account to tap. For them, a $500,000 fine is pocket change, the cost of doing business.\nFor others, though, it\u2019s real money. Small wonder, then, that they are latching onto every technicality in sight.\nStill, squarely under the microscope as he now is, Mr. Liu may want to think how all this looks. Here he is, the city comptroller, a man whose job it is to wag his finger at others about keeping their books in order, and meanwhile his own finances are raising eyebrows.\nBeing a \u201cWeasel Watch\u201d regular is not something to brag about when running for mayor.\nFor more local news, including a campaign windfall for Republican politicians who supported same-sex marriage, the search for the missing cornerstone at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, a Bowery building that houses a flophouse and a luxurious hotel designed like a flophouse, see the N.Y./Region section.\nHere is what City Room is reading in other papers and blogs:\nA former New York Police Department detective testified that detectives frequently fabricated drug charges to meet arrest quotas.

The condition was thought to make cancer of the esophagus up to 40 times as likely.\nBut the new study found that the risk of esophageal cancer in Barrett\u2019s patients was only about a fifth of what is currently believed. That suggests that the routine tests and endoscopies patients are subjected to may not be necessary in many cases, said Dr. Peter Funch-Jensen, a professor of surgery at Aarhus University in Denmark and an author of the study, which was published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nThe study is by far the largest and most comprehensive to date on the subject.\n\u201cIf you combine the data from all other studies, it adds up to about 60,000 patient-years, and our study comes out to about 70,000 patient-years,\u201d Dr. Funch-Jensen said.\nTo come up with the new estimate, Dr. Funch-Jensen and his colleagues collected data over nearly 20 years on more than 11,000 people in Denmark who had a diagnosis of Barrett\u2019s esophagus. The researchers used Danish medical registries, which contain data on Denmark\u2019s entire population of over five million people, many of them tracked since birth.\nThe study found that every year, 0.12 percent of the Barrett\u2019s patients \u2014 or about one in 860 people \u2014 go on to develop cancer of the esophagus, a disease that is particularly lethal. The figure was much lower than the estimate of 0.5 percent stemming from earlier studies.\nThe new study comes on the heels of a similar report published this year in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, which looked at a large population in Ireland. That study found the risk of esophageal cancer in people with Barrett\u2019s was 0.13 percent.\nAccording to current guidelines, people with Barrett\u2019s should consider undergoing an endoscopy and biopsy of the esophageal lining about every three years. But the research suggests that Barrett\u2019s patients may not need as many screening procedures. Dr. Funch-Jensen said he believed endoscopies might be unnecessary after the first year except in cases where doctors find precancerous cells, a condition known as dysplasia, or when new symptoms occur.\n\u201cSome people will have dysplasia, but that\u2019s only 5 percent of the patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the other 95 percent of the patients with no dysplasia need routine surveillance.\u201c\nAn accompanying editorial agreed with that assessment, saying the problems with close surveillance of Barrett\u2019s patients \u201clie in the numbers.\u201d\n\u201cPatients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus have the same life expectancy as does the general population, and esophageal cancer proves to be an uncommon cause of death in patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus,\u201d wrote Dr. Peter J. Kahrilas, chief of gastroenterology at the Northwestern University medical school and the author of the editorial. \u201cCurrently available evidence has not shown that the current strategy of screening and surveillance of patients with Barrett\u2019s esophagus is cost-effective or reduces mortality from esophageal adenocarcinoma.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The annual meeting, in Los Angeles, marks the first time investors have had the opportunity to question Mr. Murdoch since a phone-hacking scandal at the British newspaper unit humbled the company over the summer.\nNews Corporation has artfully chosen to hold the meeting at a 476-seat theater on its Fox Studios lot, the epicenter of its entertainment empire, a segment of the company that brings in billions with movies like the recent \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d remake and TV shows like \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cModern Family.\u201d The lot, in a palm-tree-lined area not far from Beverly Hills, also feels a world away from London, where the phone-hacking scandal unfolded and where an investigation continues in Parliament. Several News International executives have resigned and others were arrested.\nNews Corporation has said that the scandal has not had a significant impact on the company\u2019s financial performance and defended its leadership ahead of today\u2019s shareholder vote.\nAs shareholders arrive on shuttle buses provided by News Corporation, here are five things to watch for:\nThe Vote\nNews Corporation stockholders will have the chance to vote on the company\u2019s current leadership. Several outside advisory firms have released reports urging shareholders to vote against many members of the board, including Mr. Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan. Natalie Bancroft, an aspiring opera singer, also faces a \u201cno\u201d vote. Even dissident shareholders overwhelmingly approve of New York City\u2019s former public schools chancellor, Joel Klein, and have said they will keep him on the board. The vote will largely be symbolic since the Murdoch family controls 40 percent of voting shares, but a loud enough cry to remove some board members could eventually prompt change.\nState of the Union\nOne long-time shareholder who has attended several annual meetings called this part of the presentation the \u201cRupert Show.\u201d After answering investors\u2019 questions (or politely shooting them down), Mr. Murdoch will give shareholders a rundown of the financial health of the company and tell them why News Corporation stock is a good investment. The embarrassment of the hacking scandal hasn\u2019t had significant impact on the company\u2019s bottom line. Mr. Murdoch has already signaled he will promote the fact that News Corporation has performed well even as other media companies struggle. Clips of Fox\u2019s most successful movies and TV shows could be sprinkled in to remind investors where the real revenue comes from.\nStump Speeches\nIt\u2019s unclear how much time News Corporation will give to shareholders to air their views. In previous years shareholder activists have attacked Mr. Murdoch for everything from the company\u2019s Fox News network and its dealings in China to executive compensation. Tom Watson, a Labour Party member of Parliament who has led efforts to investigate the hacking scandal, flew in from London to attend the event as a non-voting proxy shareholder. He said in a phone interview Thursday that he will publicly accuse the company of further illegal surveillance activity, though he did not reveal any evidence. \u201cAs a company that frequently talks about free speech, I would hope they give shareholders\u201d sufficient time. Mr. Watson said.\nStock Buybacks\nChase Carey, News Corporation\u2019s chief operating officer, has in recent months reached out to Wall Street and assured key investors that the company will continue to buy back stock even after the ongoing $5 billion buyback plan ends, an approach that analysts and big investors view as extremely positive. \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to be there financially,\u201d Digby Gilmour, head of telecommunications and media research at C.L.S.A. Australia, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of whether you need to be comfortable with the Murdoch influence and if you\u2019re not comfortable with it, don\u2019t buy the stock.\u201d\nProverbial Pie (or Heightened Security)\nPrevious shareholder meetings have not required attendees to R.S.V.P. or register. But this year the company said it was taking increased security measures. After a man hit Mr. Murdoch with a shaving-cream pie during his testimony before Parliament this summer, the company is not taking any chances. Nevertheless, analysts expect shareholders to throw plenty of verbal pie \u2014 the kind that Wendi Deng Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch\u2019s wife and a former volleyball player, cannot swat down.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Les Hinton, former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, will testify to Parliament via video conference on Monday.\nMr. Watson is one of hundreds of investors who will have the opportunity to address Rupert Murdoch, News Corporation chief executive and chairman, and vote on the company\u2019s leadership.\nAlthough the vote will be largely symbolic, with Mr. Murdoch controlling nearly 40 percent of shares, shareholder activists have flown to Los Angeles from Australia and the U.K. to attend.\nMr. Watson said he plans to allege further illegal activity at News Corporation, though he would not get into specifics, saying he wants to \u201csave\u201d something for shareholders on Friday.\nSeveral shareholder groups and outside advisory firms have encouraged stockholders to vote against Mr. Murdoch and several other board members, including Mr. Murdoch\u2019s sons, James and Lachlan.

In July, News Corporation shuttered its 168-year-old \u201cNews of the World\u201d tabloid.\n\u201cThe one thing investors who own News Corporation should care about is the return of capital,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The newspaper paid significant damages, and the cases opened the door to further lawsuits and a new criminal investigation. The Metropolitan Police said last week that the number of possible phone-hacking victims currently stands at 5,795.\nThe aim of the surveillance, the BBC reported, citing internal News of the World documents, was to demonstrate that Mr. Lewis and Ms. Harris were involved in a romantic relationship and that they might be sharing confidential information. They might then be compelled, said a News of the World lawyer in an e-mail quoted by the BBC, to recuse themselves from further hacking cases. The surveillance was discussed, the BBC also reported, without specific names, \u201cat a very high level.\u201d\nThe spying included the lawyers\u2019 families. Mr. Lewis\u2019s former wife and teenaged daughter were watched, Mr. Webb said.\nCiting surveillance reports, Nick Davies of The Guardian reported that Ms. Harris and her two young children also appear to have been followed.\nThe British newspaper division of News Corporation said in a statement:\nNews International\u2019s inquiries have led the company to believe that Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris were subject to surveillance. While surveillance is not illegal, it was clearly deeply inappropriate in these circumstances. This action was not condoned by any current executive at the company\nMr. Lewis described the surveillance of his daughter as \u201cnothing short of sick.\u201d Tom Watson, a British lawmaker who has been prominent in parliamentary investigations of phone hacking, said Monday that the revelation \u201cshows an utterly relentless and ruthless organization\u201d that would \u201cstop at nothing.\u201d\nThe surveillance has increased pressure on Mr. Murdoch\u2019s son James, the head of his father\u2019s European and Asian operations, who oversaw The News of the World during the period in question.

Corzine until last week.\nAs regulators hunt for $600 million in missing customer money at the firm, many clients are aiming their anger at one of MF Global\u2019s primary regulators: the CME Group.\nFor decades, commodities and futures trading firms have been largely policed by the exchanges where they trade, setting up potential conflicts of interest. These profit-making exchanges, like the CME Group, oversee the very futures firms they rely on for business, a self-regulatory system unlike that overseeing the Wall Street banks, which contend with armies of federal regulators.\nSome farmers that used MF Global to protect themselves from the price swings of their crops are losing faith. \u201cYou do business with these places and you just assume they are fine and reputable,\u201d said Brian Eggebrecht, a third-generation grain farmer in Montana. \u201cIt\u2019s a scary time for farmers. Who\u2019s to say what is going on with the other clearinghouses?\u201d\nThe CME says the missing money at MF Global is an isolated incident, and does not warrant an overhaul of the exchange\u2019s regulatory powers. Other industry insiders said there had not been problems with group\u2019s regulation in the past.\n\u201cThe self-regulatory structure, since our founding, has been a hallmark of our safe and stable markets. It has served our market users well and continues to,\u201d Anita Liskey, a CME spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cNo one has a higher interest in making sure the members don\u2019t fail or cause a loss to the clearinghouse and other members of the clearinghouse than CME Group.\u201d\nCustomers of MF Global who used the CME\u2019s exchanges say it has done little to help its cause. Many are furious that they were frozen out of trading by the CME on the day MF Global filed for Chapter 11. Traders on the floor of the exchange scribbled down the prices for trades they felt they should have been able to clear, to keep records of their losses.\n\u201cPrice and time are extraordinarily important, and the CME knows this,\u201d said John L. Roe, a principal at the BTR Trading Group, which did business with MF Global. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if you can calculate the loss. The tentacles reach out into just about every type of commodity.\u201d\nSome have also raised questions about whether the CME should have noticed the missing money, since ensuring that customer accounts are segregated is its responsibility. The frozen funds mean some business owners, like Daniel Ward, may struggle.\n\u201cThe loss of my actual money, $86,076.80 and $1,801.00, is seriously impeding the day-to-day operations of my family-owned business,\u201d Mr. Ward, the owner of True Metals Group, said in a letter to the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy. \u201cThis is unfair to persons like me, small-business owners who depend on modest futures accounts to hedge risk.\u201d\nFederal regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, are searching for the missing $600 million, and the CME is helping to sort through the process. It was charged with regulating the side of the business where the money was determined to be missing.\n\u201cWe are cooperating with all authorities on their investigations of MF Global,\u201d said Ms. Liskey, the CME spokeswoman.\nOn Nov. 2, the exchange issued a harshly worded statement that blamed MF Global, saying the firm might have transferred client money \u201cin a manner that may have been designed to avoid detection,\u201d a serious violation of Wall Street regulations. The exchange said it had conducted an audit of the firm a week earlier.\nBut the last large-scale audit the CME conducted was in January. The last-minute review it cited in the release was a \u201cspot audit,\u201d said a person close to the CME who did not want to be identified because the investigation was continuing.\nThe CME verified that customer money was in the right accounts at outside banks on Oct. 26, this person said. MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 31.\nA number of customers say that the CME should cover the $600 million in missing funds that has gummed up the bankruptcy process. The exchange can then ensure that the accounts are properly transferred or unfrozen. At least $2.5 billion of MF Global\u2019s $5.4 billion in client funds was with the CME at the time of the bankruptcy.\n\u201cIt is time for the executive team at CME to save its business and do the right thing,\u201d wrote Glenn Jackel, a managing member at Traxian Partners with about $1 million trapped at MF Global, in a letter to CME board members. \u201cAs it stands now, the MF Global debacle represents every single deep-seated underlying fear that commodity investors have, that their money will be lost or frozen in a commodity firm meltdown.\u201d\nReached by phone, Mr. Jackel said it was not just the CME\u2019s reputation that was at stake but the entire futures business.\n\u201cThink about what happens in this business if I don\u2019t get my money back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the chances of me putting any significant money into any commodities again?\u201d\nWhile traders and others can find new business or opt out of the markets, farmers may not have that luxury. For many, participating in the futures market is as necessary as tilling the land.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t gamble on your whole crop; that\u2019s why we use these markets and that\u2019s why they\u2019re very important to us,\u201d said Mr. Eggebrecht, the Montana farmer. \u201cThere is a lot of risk out there, and we are the end users of that risk and we end learning about it the hard way.\u201d\nTen years ago, Mr. Eggebrecht, whose ancestors were homesteaders on the land he now farms, had scarcely used futures or options contracts. Now, much of his business depends on them.\nThe market allows him to lock in a price to deliver his winter wheat at a future date. He says these contracts protect him from volatile price swings that can batter the commodities markets.\nThe volatility has tracked the boom in the futures industry, which has grown exponentially over the last decade as electronic trading and newfangled financial products have crowded out simpler transactions. The futures and options market set a record of 22.4 billion contracts last year, a 650 percent jump from 2000 levels, according to the Futures Industry Association, a trade group.\nThe CME has been at the center of the growth. Founded in the mid-1800s, the exchange became the clearinghouse of choice for commodities. In 2002, it became the first United States exchange to go public, and quickly began buying up its largest competitors, including the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nDuring that consolidation, some questioned whether it could be an effective regulator. \u201cHow many other public companies are self-regulators?\u201d asked Jerod Leman, a trader and broker in Indiana. \u201cIndividuals aren\u2019t the regulators on their taxes. You have the I.R.S. for that.\u201d\n\u201cThe last thing most people want is more regulation, but when something like this happens it definitely raises some flags,\u201d he added.\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the CME Group, reviewed the arrangement at the time, but the industry fought back hard.\n\u201cCME has a long history and strong track record in self-regulation,\u201d the exchange told the futures commission in a 2004 letter. \u201cAs one of the major exchanges in the world, we believe that our market surveillance and financial supervision regulatory capabilities are part of the brand identity that we have created.\u201d\nThe commission backed off after winning a few concessions, including more independent board members at the exchanges. The chairman of the commission at the start of the debate, James Newsome, went on to join the CME Group board after leaving the agency. More recently, Mr. Newsome\u2019s lobbying firm has represented MF Global.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But this isn\u2018t just historical fiction; it\u2019s a fictional vision of a historical event that has never been satisfactorily explained. To write the true history of the Kennedy assassination, we need to know it. But how much do we know of what really happened?\nKing believes that Oswald is guilty, and argues in terms of the stories we tell about that day: \u201cEarly in the novel,\u201d he writes in an afterword, \u201cJake Epping\u2019s friend Al puts the probability that Oswald was the lone gunman at 95 percent. After reading a stack of books and articles on the subject almost as tall as I am, I\u2019d put the probability at 98 percent, maybe even 99. Because all of the accounts, including those written by conspiracy theorists, tell the same simple American story: here was a dangerous little fame junkie who found himself in the right place to get lucky.\u201d\nErrol Morris: Aren\u2019t you going to have to deal with that whole lone gunman versus conspiracy thing? The endless debates about what really happened?\nStephen King: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019m prepared for trouble when the book comes out. Conspiracy people guard themselves pretty jealously. They have their theories and some of them are pretty complex, and some of them are pretty simple. Some of them have been disproved. But one of the things that sticks in my mind is that none of them has been proved. None of them. So it\u2019s like U.F.O.s\u2026 If they\u2019re really U.F.O.s, how come one has never landed, or we\u2019ve never been given definitive proof?\nBut, do you have to resolve these questions? Is it even possible? Nearly 50 years later, people are still arguing about it. In the afterword, you caution people that this is not history.\nNo. It is a novel.\nBut resolved or unresolved, the mystery of what happened stands behind everything. It is perhaps unavoidable. There are cases where you have the feeling of puzzle pieces coming together. Where the evidence leads to a conclusion. But there are other cases that devolve into chaos, confusion. The Kennedy assassination, I would argue, is one of them. The question is, why? What happened? Why did it become an investigative morass?\nWell, the reason is, I would say, because Ruby shot Oswald. And when Ruby shot Oswald, he shut his mouth. He permanently silenced him. So there was never any light cast from that standpoint. As a result, you have all these witnesses who stepped forward who saw this and saw that and saw guys on the grassy knoll and this and that and the other thing. It\u2019s a little bit like the blind man describing the elephant. One\u2019s got the trunk and says it\u2019s a snake. And one\u2019s got a leg and says it\u2019s a tree. One\u2019s got an ear and says it\u2019s a banana plant. They all say different things because none of them can see the whole thing. The only one who could really tell us what happened is dead. I\u2019m not saying he would have, but I think he would have, I believe he would have, if he did it. And I do think he did it.\nYou mention in your afterword Thomas Mallon\u2019s novel \u201cMrs. Paine\u2019s Garage.\u201d\n[Mallon chronicles the relationship between the Oswalds and the Paines, Quakers who befriended them. They are of particular historical interest because Oswald\u2019s Mannlicher-Carcano rifle was stored in the Paines\u2019 garage.]\nYes. He has a good take on conspiracy people. And Norman Mailer, who provides an epigram at the beginning of the book, says people find it very difficult to believe it could have happened the way it happened because it suggests an absurd universe. But there it is. The line is pretty conclusive to me. The mail-order gun that he bought \u2014 he used that gun to try to shoot Gen. Edwin Walker. And that\u2019s the gun that was found at the depository with his fingerprints on it. And then he ran, he shot the police officer J. D. Tippit, and they caught him. To me, that\u2019s it. The chain of events seems outrageous, but let me tell you a story. This happened a couple of weeks ago in the Midwest. This guy won the lottery, he won a million dollars or something on the lottery. Maybe it was multimillions. But you know how it is, it\u2019s a great human interest story. So the press comes and this film crew from one of the local stations says to him, \u201cWe want to recreate you winning the lottery.\u201d You know where this is going, right?\nI\u2019m not sure.\n\u201cThe book that I wrote is a time-travel story.\u201d\n\u2014 Stephen King\nBear with me. So they went to the store where he had bought the scratch ticket and won the million dollars. And they filmed, and he scratched the ticket and he said, \u201cHoly \u2014 I just won another $100,000.\u201d Now, that\u2019s the sort of thing where if you\u2019re not there, if you\u2019re not part of it, you just say to yourself, \u201cThis is just absurd.\u201d But it happens all the time. Oswald just happened to be at the right place at the right time. He and his wife were effectively done, and she was living with Mrs. Paine out in Irving. He used to come on the weekends, but that week, he came on Thursday \u2014 the night before the assassination. And it seems pretty clear from his actions and from the things he said that he had decided to do this, but that he could be persuaded to change his mind. He and Marina went to bed that night and in bed, he asked her, \u201cIs there a chance that we can get back together?\u201d And she was very cold to him. She said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever going to happen, Lee.\u201d And in the morning, he left his wedding ring and he left all the money in his pockets in a teacup in the kitchen for her. And that was it. There is this chain of ifs, but really, it\u2019s as simple as that. He wanted to shoot somebody. He wanted to be somebody famous. It\u2019s all there. The pieces all click together pretty nicely.\nAnd yet you don\u2019t really believe in coincidences, do you?\nYes, I do. The book that I wrote is a time-travel story. The coincidences are minimized by this idea that the past tries to echo itself over and over again. But it\u2019s not fate when somebody wins the lottery. Some guy picks numbers, or the computer picks numbers, and those numbers come up. You know? It\u2019s a coincidental world.\nYou have created a rabbit hole into the past. But the Kennedy assassination has always struck me as the mother of all rabbit holes. You disappear into it and never emerge again. The books get longer and longer as people write them. They started out at a couple of hundred pages. And now, the books have metastasized. Vincent Bugliosi\u2019s book, \u201cReclaiming History,\u201d is, I don\u2019t know, more than a thousand pages. With a CD-ROM that adds a couple of thousand more.\nYes. That\u2019s one I didn\u2019t read. The Mailer book, \u201cOswald\u2019s Tale,\u201d is 800 pages long. That\u2019s a pretty long one. He goes way back to Marina\u2019s antecedents in Russia and all the rest. But when people bring it up, I\u2019m just going to say, \u201cYou believe what you believe.\u201d My wife believes it\u2019s a conspiracy.\nYou mentioned that in the afterword, that you and your wife disagreed.\nShe loved John Kennedy in a way that I never did. I grew up in a Republican household, though my mother cried her eyes out when Kennedy got shot. Little John-John salutes the casket when it goes by. You couldn\u2019t help it, whether you were Republican or Democrat. I don\u2019t know what would happen now, but I do know one of the reasons to write the book was because there\u2019s so much hate in the air now, so much hate. A lot of it\u2019s directed at Obama. I think I decided I wanted to write this book when Obama was giving the State of the Union speech and that guy shouted, \u201cYou lie!\u201d You know? It\u2019s a real change in American politics, and it goes back to Kennedy, because people hated that guy, too, until he died.\nOne of the things that I liked about the book is what I keep thinking of as twin mysteries. There\u2019s the mystery of whether one man can change the world by going back in time. Will it be for the better or for the worse?\nRight, the consequences.\nYes, the consequences of changing the world, if one could do so. The other thing, which I really, really like, is that even if we go back into the past, history remains a mystery. Is Lee Harvey Oswald guilty? Your protagonist still has to investigate, because he\u2019s a good man. He doesn\u2019t want to kill somebody just for the sake of killing somebody. It would be immoral, it would be wrong.\nIt would be wrong.\nBefore he can act, he has to give himself some assurance that he\u2019s acting correctly, that he\u2019s acting responsibly. So all of that stuff, placing the surveillance equipment in the Oswald apartment \u2014\nOh God, that was hard. The guy and his wife spoke Russian the whole time. That was the worst part of writing the book. I hope it\u2019s not too boring.\nI loved that part. What was so hard about it?\nWell, there was certain information I wanted to put across about how they got along and about Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s mother, who was just a harridan. And his feelings about socialism, how they changed, how he felt about Cuba. And I thought, the guy lives across the street. I don\u2019t want a lot of technological huggermugger; I don\u2019t really want to get bogged down in a lot of detail, you know?\nThere are these forces of malefaction, and then there\u2019s one scene that I wanted to ask you about, where you make your argument for why Kennedy is a good man. It\u2019s this moment with a gentleman in an alpine hat and lederhosen.\nWhere the guy\u2019s playing \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d on the accordion for the president. It\u2019s one of my favorite things in the whole book. You can watch it online. It\u2019s one of the places where you see Kennedy as a real guy. I think it\u2019s Tampa. And it\u2019s the same car, and Kennedy does the same thing where he gets out of the car and he walks into the crowd. You can see the Secret Service people are just going absolutely nuts about this. And there\u2019s not a thing they can do about it, because that\u2019s the way he was. He really wanted to be with people and touch people.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a lot of technological huggermugger; I don\u2019t really want to get bogged down in a lot of detail, you know?\u201d\n\u2014 Stephen King\nAnd you liked it so much because \u2014 ?\nBecause it was human. You know, it was just a human moment. It humanizes him, and changes him. It\u2019s a first-person narrative, and the best I could do is to try to humanize people from afar. See Oswald a little bit, and show that he\u2019s not completely a monster. He did apparently love his kids. He didn\u2019t beat them. He only beat his wife. I didn\u2019t want them to be figures on a chessboard, O.K.? Best I can do. It\u2019s a sentimental book in a lot of ways, but sentiment\u2019s a part of life. I tried not to wallow in it.\nBut there\u2019s also evil.\nWell, I try to shy away from the word \u201cevil\u201d because it\u2019s so simple to say, \u201cWell, these things happen because there\u2019s evil in the world.\u201d And as you say, most of it\u2019s just little evil. But if it\u2019s all connected \u2014 maybe it is big evil. And maybe we don\u2019t need to say that right out loud.\nI also wanted to ask you about the difficulty of actually writing something that is connected with real history.\nWell, I never tried anything like that before, and I\u2019m not sure that I would ever want to try again, because, man, it was too much like work. I mean, I\u2019ve done stuff that\u2019s used reality as a base before. In this case, that\u2019s why I stopped the first time I tried it. I was teaching school, and it was 1971 and I was in the teachers\u2019 room and people were talking about the Kennedy assassination. The 22nd would roll around and people would talk and write about the assassination and stuff. I guess somebody must have said, \u201cWhat would it have been like if Kennedy had lived?\u201d And I thought to myself, \u201cI\u2019d love to write a story about that.\u201d But there are so many real people, and there\u2019s the whole idea of trying to integrate the past and make it real. And it just seemed too big to me at that time, and it was big. I\u2019ve still got a roomful of research materials. Then once you start, the other trick is to not make it into something that\u2019s boring, that\u2019s all history: \u201cLook what I read, and here are these interesting facts.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to do a James Michener thing.\nWell, your romance intersects with history. It\u2019s not historical per se. It\u2019s a love story, and the fact that you\u2019re off in a small town and not in the middle of everything allows you to write something that goes well beyond a collection of facts.\nYes, a real novel. But most of the stuff about Oswald and Marina that I thought is interesting is true, and a lot of the stuff about Marguerite Oswald is true. I just tried not to overwhelm the reader with it.\nAnd the idea of making the future worse?\nWell, that was always going to be the kicker for the book. When I actually sat down to write the book, I started to ask people \u2014 my wife was a history major and I asked her, \u201cWell, what would have happened if Kennedy had lived?\u201d And I asked some other people. Finally, I went to Doris Kearns Goodwin, who was an aide for Johnson in those days, and her husband, Dick Goodwin, who was part of the Kennedy team. And I asked them to sort of spitball about things that might have happened if Kennedy had lived. And one of the things they pointed out \u2013\u2013 it\u2019s a weakness with Obama, too \u2013\u2013 Kennedy was inexperienced enough to have a real difficult time dealing with the Senate and the House of Representatives. Johnson was much better at it. He was able to push a lot of stuff through. He was very canny about it. Johnson said, \u201cWell, we ought to do this, this and this to help memorialize our dead Jack Kennedy.\u201d And so we got the civil rights thing and a bunch of other stuff as well, including Medicare, I think.\nAnd the chances that Kennedy would have done this or have been able to do this\u2013\u2013\u2013\nA lot smaller. It was Doris who said \u2013 I thought of this, but it just seemed so wild \u2013 Wallace might really have gotten elected in 1968. It\u2019s fascinating, though, isn\u2019t it? That one minute \u2013 less than a minute \u2013 in Dallas, and everything\u2019s up for grabs. I believe in those watershed moments. In 1999, I got hit by a van and almost killed. I was out taking a walk in the afternoon; I\u2019ve thought back on that many times. And I\u2019m thinking if I\u2019d left a minute earlier or if I\u2019d left a minute later, if I\u2019d stayed another 15 minutes at lunch, if somebody had dropped by \u2014 if, if, if. But those things didn\u2019t happen, so I happened to be at that one particular place at that one particular time. And something happened that changed my life. Today, it probably doesn\u2019t matter if we talk until 10 minutes of 1 or 10 minutes past 1, things are going to go pretty much as planned. Most days, they do. But not always.\nDid you change your view of the past at all in writing this?\nI don\u2019t think so. I think that it clarified a little bit. When you write about the past, the more you write, the clearer the past becomes. It\u2019s like being regressed under hypnosis. My view of the past is that attitudes change, but they change very slowly. Underneath, they stay pretty much the same. \u201cThe fundamental things apply as time goes by.\u201d\nIndeed. Your protagonist is sort of guilt-tripped into the past. He wasn\u2019t even alive when Kennedy was shot. But he has nothing to lose; his life is a shambles.\n\u201cMy view of the past is that attitudes change, but they change very slowly. Underneath, they stay pretty much the same.\u201d\n\u2014 Stephen King\nWell, it\u2019s true that he doesn\u2019t have much of a life in 2011. He goes back into the past and finds a life, which is probably another kind of romantic, sentimental idea, but I like it. I like the idea that he finds somewhere that he would like to stay, and I like it at the end he realizes that he cannot. If he learns anything, he learns that you have to leave things alone. Things are better left the way that they are.\nDo you think that\u2019s true?\nNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true for us, because we can\u2019t see the future. We don\u2019t know the influence that our actions have. It\u2019s something that\u2019s unique to the time-traveler\u2019s story; he\u2019s screwing with the cogs and wheels of the universe. But for most of us, we go along and we do the best that we can and we try not to hurt other people. Most of us do, anyway. I guess there are always, you know, the Ted Bundys of the world. If you could go back and stop Hitler or something like that, you would, wouldn\u2019t you?\nWould I stop Hitler? Yes.\nYes, sure you would.\nMy mother\u2019s dead, but I think my mother would be proud of me.\nBut, of course, she wouldn\u2019t know who Hitler was. Because he would have been totally whisked off the stage. This book is, in a way, like a photo negative of my novel \u201cThe Dead Zone.\u201d In that book, Johnny Smith is the guy in the high place with the rifle who feels like he\u2019s seen the future. He\u2019s seen this guy, Greg Stillson, and he sees what he\u2019s going to do when he becomes president, because he has this precognitive talent. And he feels like he has to kill him. At the last moment, fate intervenes. I got really uncomfortable with the idea of saying, \u201cWell, under certain circumstances, assassination is a good thing.\u201d And this book is a chance to do it the other way and to take the assassination back.\nPhilosophers have endlessly speculated about the nature of evil. Why there has to be evil \u2013\nWell, it does seem to me that, without evil, there is no good, because we wouldn\u2019t have anything to compare it to.\nBut in your novel, history seems to involve a kind of balancing act between good and evil. We don\u2019t know the interrelationship of things. What you call the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d: change one thing in the hope of making the world a better place, and something\u2019s going to happen to make the world even worse.\nWell, Ray Bradbury called it the butterfly effect before me. It\u2019s also been called the Rube Goldberg effect \u2013 where you see the world as an infernal machine. When you pull Lever A, Spring B hits Cog C. The next thing you know, the models are all over the floor. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the way things are, but it\u2019s certainly plausible. I tried as much as I could when I wrote the book not to get caught up in any of the paradoxes and things that go along with time travel.\nWell, the book is really not about time travel per se.\nNot at all. Not at all. It\u2019s just a device.\nIt\u2019s a device to allow us to examine fate, love, memory, history. And as such, it\u2019s truly compelling.\nYou know what? It\u2019s like \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels.\u201d Swift never goes into this big long thing about well, there was a genetic mutation and therefore these people became small, and all the rest. We don\u2019t really care about that. It\u2019s just the idea: they\u2019re there. Then we can use it to examine real life.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Probably they were cameras designed to detect red-light runners. Or maybe their purpose was general surveillance. No matter \u2013 the point was that big brother was watching. Big brother, as we all have plenty of reason to believe, is watching everyone.\nAnd that\u2019s why a current case on the Supreme Court\u2019s docket has resonated so deeply with the public. No, I don\u2019t mean health care, about which I will have more to say in future columns. I mean the\ncase, argued last week, about whether the police can attach a GPS device to a person\u2019s car and follow its every move for a month \u2013 without a warrant. The question is whether the high-tech surveillance\nof the publicly visible movements of a suspected drug dealer amounted to a search that violated the Fourth Amendment.\nThe case, United States v. Jones, has generated an enormous amount of attention, unusual for a criminal case that doesn\u2019t involve the death penalty or terrorism. The search terms \u201cGPS\u201d with \u201cSupreme Court\u201d produced 100 screens of responses on Google. Although the justices will decide the case in formal doctrinal terms, there is no getting away from the deeper issue: what, if any, are the permissible limits of government watchfulness over our daily lives. Supreme Court cases occasionally come along that tell us as much about ourselves as about legal doctrine or the court itself, and this is one of them.\nIn fact, last week\u2019s argument found the members of the court behaving as much as our surrogates as they were our judges. Across the ideological spectrum, they expressed alarm at the federal government\u2019s core argument, which is that because the GPS tracks the location of vehicles only as they travel the public roadways \u2014 as law enforcement agents could do with their own eyes if there were enough of them and they could move fast enough \u2014 nothing of constitutional consequence occurred. There was no search.\n\u201cYou think there would also not be a search,\u201d Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked Michael R. Dreeben, the deputy solicitor general who argued for the government, \u201cif you put a GPS device on all of our cars, monitored our movements for a month? You think you\u2019re entitled to do that under your theory?\u201d\nThe normally unflappable government lawyer stalled for time. \u201cThe justices of this court?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nOf course, as the chief justice knew, the government\u2019s theory gave Mr. Dreeben no choice. I\u2019ll quote at length, from the official transcript, of what followed.\nMr. Dreeben: \u201cUnder our theory and under this court\u2019s cases, the justices of this court, when driving on public roadways, have no greater expectation\u2026\u201d\nChief Justice Roberts: \u201cSo your answer is yes, you could tomorrow decide that you put a GPS device on every one of our cars, follow us for a month, no problem under the Constitution?\u201d\nMr. Dreeben: \u201cWell, equally, Mr. Chief Justice, if the FBI wanted to, it could put its team of surveillance agents around the clock on any individual and follow that individual\u2019s movements as they went around on the public streets and they would thereby gather\u2026\u201d\nHere, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. jumped in to take issue with Mr. Dreeben\u2019s FBI analogy. \u201cThe heart of the problem that\u2019s presented by this case,\u201d Justice Alito said, \u201cis that in the pre-computer, pre-Internet age, much of the privacy \u2013 I would say most of the privacy \u2013 that people enjoyed was not the result of legal protections or constitutional protections. It was the result simply of the difficulty of traveling around and gathering up information.\n\u201cBut with computers, it\u2019s now so simple to amass an enormous amount of information about people that consists of things that could have been observed on the streets, information that was made available to the public\u2026 So, how do we deal with this? Do we just say, well, nothing is changed, so that all the information that people expose to the public is fair game? There is no search or seizure when that is obtained, because there isn\u2019t a reasonable expectation of privacy? But isn\u2019t there a real change in this regard?\u201d\nJustice Alito, a former federal prosecutor and probably the court\u2019s most pro-prosecution justice, put his finger on the precise issue. \u201cReasonable expectation of privacy\u201d is a phrase at the heart of the modern Fourth Amendment. By its text, the amendment only guarantees \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d\nBut the Supreme Court decades ago took a broader view, ruling in a landmark case concerning the placement of an electronic listening device on the outside of a public telephone booth that a search could be unreasonable even without a physical intrusion into a private place. \u201cWherever a man may be, he is entitled to know that he will remain free from unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the court in Katz v. United States in 1967. Justice John M. Harlan\u2019s concurring opinion provided the two-part definition of Fourth Amendment freedom that remains operative today: \u201cFirst, that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d\nExactly what \u201csociety\u201d thinks about GPS monitoring, and how Supreme Court justices are supposed to know, then becomes the question. Twenty-eight years ago, in United States v. Knotts, the court upheld the government\u2019s use of a beeper planted in a canister of drug-making chemicals and placed in the trunk of a car. \u201cA person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another,\u201d William H. Rehnquist, then an associate justice, wrote for the court.\nReferring to that precedent, Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Dreeben: \u201cYou can see, though, can\u2019t you, that 30 years ago if you asked people does it violate your privacy to be followed by a beeper, the police following you, you might get one answer, while today if you ask people does it violate your right to privacy to know that the police can have a record of every movement you made in the past month, they might see that differently?\u201d\nIt\u2019s an argument that works both ways, as Justice Alito made clear later when he commented to Stephen C. Leckar, the defendant\u2019s lawyer: \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know what society expects, and I think it\u2019s changing. Technology is changing people\u2019s expectations of privacy. Suppose we look forward 10 years, and maybe 10 years from now, 90 percent of the population will be using social networking sites, and they will have, on average, 500 friends, and they will have allowed their friends to monitor their location 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through the use of their cell phones. What would the expectation of privacy be then?\u201d\nIt\u2019s always seemed to me that a \u201creasonable expectation of privacy\u201d is little more than an expectation that at least five justices are prepared to recognize as reasonable with respect to their own privacy. For example, in a case in 2000, Bond v. United States, the court held that it violated the Fourth Amendment for a police officer to move down the aisle of a bus squeezing passengers\u2019 overhead luggage to see if anything felt suspicious. The government had argued that a passenger had no reasonable expectation of privacy in luggage sitting exposed to public view. True, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, \u201ca bus passenger clearly expects that his bag may be handled.\u201d But \u201che does not expect that other passengers or bus employees will, as a matter of course, feel the bag in an exploratory manner\u201d as the officer did in that case.\nIn reading that opinion, while I had trouble imagining the justices as passengers on an inter-city bus, I could certainly envision them stowing their soft-sided briefcases in the overhead compartments of planes, and I suspect they could imagine that scene quite vividly as well. I had a similar reaction to a 1998 decision, Knowles v. Iowa, in which the court unanimously invalidated a routine search of a car that had been stopped for speeding. Technically, this was not a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d case, but rather a question of whether the police had conducted a valid \u201csearch incident to arrest\u201d when they had not bothered to arrest the driver. It\u2019s hardly unknown for a Supreme Court justice to be stopped for speeding.\nThese cases, I should emphasize, are exceptions. Fourth Amendment cases involving behavior with which the justices don\u2019t instinctively identify, and in which the court rules reflexively for the government, are too numerous to go into here.\nIn any event, it\u2019s not implausible to suppose that the outcome of the GPS case will depend in large part on the justices\u2019 view of reasonable government behavior toward a citizenry that includes themselves. In fact, it\u2019s implausible to suppose otherwise.\nA few weeks ago, I flew home from Detroit after speaking there to a chapter of the American Constitution Society, a network of progressive law students and lawyers. (I serve on its national board.) It turned out that the Detroit airport is one of the locations at which the Transportation Security Administration is testing its new \u201cintelligence-based\u201d protocol, asking passengers questions about the reason for their travel.\nWhat had I been doing in Detroit, the T.S.A. agent asked after he examined my boarding pass and driver\u2019s license.\n\u201cGiving a speech.\u201d\nWho had I been speaking to?\n\u201cThe American Constitution Society.\u201d\nWhat was my subject?\n\u201cConstitutional rights.\u201d\nHe never cracked a smile.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Before three federal appeals court judges in Lower Manhattan, Patricia A. Millett, a lawyer for Mr. Rajaratnam, will argue that the government violated his constitutional rights in its use of wiretaps and that he should be released on bail pending the outcome of his appeal.\nThe panel of judges on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit could issue its ruling at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, either ordering him to begin his prison term as scheduled or allowing him to remain free on bail until his appeal is resolved, which legal experts say could take as long as a year.\n\u201cGiven that Rajaratnam\u2019s surrender date is Monday, it seems likely that the Second Circuit will rule quickly on this motion,\u201d said Harlan J. Protass, a defense lawyer in New York not involved in the case.\nIn May, a federal jury found Mr. Rajaratnam guilty of running a large insider trading scheme for six years at his hedge fund, the Galleon Group. During the two-month trial, the jury heard dozens of secretly recorded conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and those suspected of being his accomplices. At Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s sentencing last month, Judge Richard J. Holwell rejected the financier\u2019s request to remain free while he appealed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that an appeal raises a substantial question of law likely to result in reversal or a new trial,\u201d said Judge Holwell, in denying the motion.\nMr. Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers dispute Judge Holwell\u2019s ruling. Among their central arguments is that the government violated Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s constitutional rights by misleading a judge to approve the secret recording of Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s telephone conversations. As a result, Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers say, the government should not have been able to use wiretap evidence during the trial.\nJudge Holwell had previously denied the defense\u2019s motion to throw out the wiretap evidence in a pretrial hearing. While the judge criticized the government for errors for its 2008 wiretap application that omitted \u201chighly relevant information\u201d in the case, he ruled that the application still contained enough evidence for his colleague, Judge Gerard E. Lynch, to approve it.\nRegardless of the outcome, Wednesday\u2019s oral argument is expected to serve as a preview of Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s actual appeal.\nMr. Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers will contend that the government misled Judge Lynch by intentionally omitting from its wiretap application that federal authorities had been investigating Mr. Rajaratnam for a year and a half and were building a conventional insider-trading case against him. Wiretapping Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s phone was unnecessary, his lawyers argue, because traditional investigative techniques \u2014 document requests and witness interviews \u2014 would have sufficed.\n\u201cThe Fourth Amendment, in other words, is not indifferent to whether the government justifies such exceptionally intrusive searches in advance or after the fact, after having been caught red-handed materially misleading the authorizing judge,\u201d said the defense in a brief filed with the appeals court.\nThe government, which will be represented Wednesday by assistant United States attorney Jonathan R. Streeter, is expected to argue that the conventional investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission had not succeeded and failed to uncover any substantive evidence of insider trading between Mr. Rajaratnam and his supposed accomplices.\nThe two sides are also expected to battle over whether Mr. Rajaratnam is a flight risk. Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers insist he is not, citing multiple rulings by Judge Holwell and a probation officer\u2019s report that agrees with them.\nFederal prosecutors counter that Mr. Rajaratnam, 54, poses a flight risk because he has the financial means to flee, even after the $157 million in assessed penalties against him. In addition, the government says, Mr. Rajaratnam is a citizen of both Sri Lanka and the United States, and not a single citizen of Sri Lanka has been extradited to face prosecution here.\nAnother expected issue that the parties will debate on Wednesday is whether the government was even authorized to use electronic surveillance to investigate insider trading.\nFor the first time in an insider trading inquiry, the government used wiretaps, a method typically reserved for drug crimes and organized crime cases, to record the telephone conversations of Mr. Rajaratnam and other Wall Street traders. Mr. Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers say that there is no indication, in either the text or the history of the federal law that authorizes electronic surveillance, that Congress intended to include insider trading in the list of fraud offenses appropriate to investigate with wiretapping.\nThe government argues that in the 1980s, Congress authorized law enforcement to use wiretaps to investigate frauds committed telephonically.\n\u201cInsider trading is precisely one of those crimes \u2014 wire fraud committed over the phone,\u201d said the government in its court papers.\nAn article on Wednesday about efforts by lawyers for the former hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam to delay the start of his prison term for an insider trading conviction misidentified, in some copies, the party that tried to throw out wiretap evidence in a pretrial hearing. It was the defense, not the prosecution.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

And new research underlines the scientific basis for the adage: the mere hint of the presence of a predator can have life-or-death consequences for the terrorized prey, regardless of the true threat.\nBiologists typically associate predator-prey relationships with direct killings, but a new paper in the journal Science explores the dynamic from a different angle. Researchers exposed song sparrow nesting areas in British Columbia to the sounds of other animals, including predators. The impact was far from trivial: mother birds that perceived predator presence had 40 percent fewer offspring than birds that were not exposed to predator noises.\n\u201cAnimals in every taxa respond to predators,\u201d said Liana Zanette, a population ecologist and conservation biologist at the University of Western Ontario and the lead author of the paper. \u201cAnd being afraid of predators can affect the number of kids you produce.\u201d\nDr. Zanette and her colleagues conducted their experiment in an area with minimal human disturbances. They surrounded bird nests with electric fences and netting to exclude actual predators and set up 24-hour surveillance\ncameras. The birds were divided into two groups; one was exposed to threatening predator sounds like crunching leaves, cawing crows and shrieking hawks, and the other listened to neutral sounds produced by geese,\nhummingbirds and seals.\nThe tapes were played every few minutes on a four-days-on, four-days-off cycle throughout the duration of the sparrows\u2019 130-day nesting cycle. The cycles of silence ensured that the birds did not become habituated to the noise. The researchers suggest that the level of constant noise, be it predator sounds or neutral sounds, was comparable to the noise level experienced by animals in urban parks.\nFemales exposed to predator noises suffered for it: they produced fewer eggs, and a greater proportion of them failed to hatch. More of their nestlings died, too, and those nestlings that did survive weighed less than their nontraumatized counterparts. Mother birds exposed to the hostile sounds built their nests in denser, thornier patches, were more skittish, spent less time at the nest and made fewer feeding visits compared with birds exposed to neutral sounds \u2014 all factors that contributed to their comparatively low success in rearing their young.\n\u201cBirds really seem to understand information in sounds,\u201d Dr. Zanette said.\nAlthough the results were gathered during a single breeding season, they could have population-level implications over a longer period of time. Not only did the frightened mothers produce fewer fledglings, but Dr. Zanette suspects that the surviving offspring probably have a decreased chance of thriving since most were underweight.\nIf young birds are under stress \u2014 for example, because they do not get enough to eat \u2014 they can also suffer from brain damage, which interferes with the ability to learn critical skills like where and how to forage. Dr. Zanette and colleagues are currently investigating whether or not the fledglings of scared mothers have a reduced survival rate after leaving the nest.\nBird behavior has a wider applicability in the animal kingdom. When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in 1995, Dr. Zanette said, their elk prey \u201cbehaved just like frightened sparrows.\u201d Mother elk kept a wary eye out for predators rather than concentrating on feeding, elk gathered in more secure but less food-rich areas, and within a few years elk populations declined 50 percent.\nThat was not because wolves ate half the elk population \u2014 there are not enough wolves in Yellowstone to pull off such a feat \u2014 but because of a reduction in elk pregnancy rates. The shrinking elk population helped the entire ecosystem, which had been overgrazed by too many hungry elk.\nDr. Zanette thinks a finer understanding of these interactions can help inform conservation decisions like whether or not to reintroduce wolves to Scotland. Many areas of that country are overgrazed by deer, and wildlife managers are considering bringing the once-native wolf back to its old hunting grounds as a natural form of deer control.\nThe observation about sparrows and elk suggests that a large number of wolves probably won\u2019t be necessary to get the job done; just enough to scare the deer into ecological balance may suffice.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Emanuel on health policy and other topics.\nIf you want to know what is wrong with American health care today, exhibit A might be the two new proton beam treatment facilities the Mayo Clinic has begun building, one in Minnesota, the other in Arizona, at a cost of more than $180 million dollars each. They are part of a medical arms race for proton beam machines, which could cost taxpayers billions of dollars for a treatment that, in many cases, appears to be no better than cheaper alternatives.\nProton beam therapy is a kind of radiation used to treat cancers. The particles are made of atomic nuclei rather than the usual X-rays, and theoretically can be focused more precisely on cancerous tissue, minimizing the danger to healthy tissue surrounding it. But the machines are tremendously expensive, requiring a particle accelerator encased in a football-field-size building with concrete walls. As a result, Medicare will pay around $50,000 for proton beam therapy for a patient with prostate cancer, roughly twice as much as it would if the patient received another type of radiation.\nThe higher price would be worth it if proton beam therapy cured more people or significantly reduced side effects. But there is no evidence showing that this is true, except for a handful of rare pediatric cancers, like brain and spinal cord cancer. For children, the treatment does a better job of limiting damage to normal brain cells and reducing the risk of cognitive impairment and hearing loss. But \u2014 fortunately \u2014 fewer than 3,500 American children get these cancers each year. It is impossible to keep all nine existing proton beam centers in full use, much less the approximately 20 others in planning or construction, with so few patients.\nTo generate sufficient revenue, proton beam facilities need to treat patients with other types of cancer. Consequently, they have been promoted for patients with lung, esophageal, breast, head and neck cancers. But the biggest target by far has been prostate cancer, diagnosed in nearly a quarter of a million men each year.\nThere is no convincing evidence that proton beam therapy is as good as \u2014 much less better than \u2014 cheaper types of radiation for any one of these cancers. There has not been a single randomized trial, only small, short-term studies. Such trials cannot evaluate the therapy\u2019s long-term outcomes, nor resolve the concerns that some experts have raised regarding a potentially increased risk of hip fractures, bowel problems or other delayed effects associated with the therapy\u2019s treatment for prostate cancer.\nSo why is the venerable Mayo Clinic building two proton beam facilities? Because it\u2019s competing against Massachusetts General Hospital, M. D. Anderson in Texas, the University of Pennsylvania, Loma Linda in California \u2014 all of which have one. With Medicare reimbursement so generous, and patients and doctors eager for the latest technology, building new machines is sane, profitable business for hospitals like Mayo.\nBut it is crazy medicine and unsustainable public policy.\nOne solution is for Medicare to simply refuse to pay for proton beam treatment except for diseases where there is valid evidence that it is clinically superior, as many private insurers do. This would certainly help keep costs down, and it would also encourage manufacturers and researchers to actually conduct studies comparing proton beam therapy to other treatments.\nHowever, it is often difficult to begin clinical trials without some reimbursement for the treatment that is being studied. So a second option is \u201ccoverage with evidence development.\u201d In this approach, Medicare would pay for proton beam treatment for patients with prostate and other cancers, but only if the patients were enrolled in a randomized trial that would compare the outcomes of their treatment to those from surgery, other kinds of radiation or active surveillance. Medicare has used this approach sparingly, but it should be applied to more cases like this one.\nThe most promising option is a new approach called dynamic pricing. Medicare would pay more for proton beam therapy, but only for diseases that are proven to be treated more effectively by the therapy than by other forms of radiation. For cancers like prostate, it would pay only what it pays for the cheaper alternatives. But if studies were done showing that proton beam therapy was better than other treatments, the payment would go up. If no studies were done, or the new evidence demonstrated no advantages, then coverage would continue, but at the lower reimbursement.\nOf course hospitals could continue charging patients more for proton beam therapy, and patients who wanted the treatment could pay the difference themselves. But this should not be seen as unfair to those who can\u2019t afford it, because there are alternatives that are just as effective.\nEveryone wants the best available care, especially for life-threatening diseases like cancer. But that doesn\u2019t mean Americans should pay exorbitant costs for treatments that can\u2019t be shown to be better than other, cheaper, options. If the United States is ever going to control our health care costs, we have to demand better evidence of effectiveness, and stop handing out taxpayer dollars with no questions asked.\nEzekiel J.

If the standoff had lasted longer than a few days, and if blood had actually been spilled, we might now know it as the Parsley War. But on July 18, they were overwhelmed and forcibly ejected by Equipo 31, a crack team of Spanish special forces soldiers. No shots were fired.\nAnd that was that. Morocco and Spain agreed to return to the status quo ante [2]: Spain\u2019s claim to the island would remain disputed, but not actively challenged, by Morocco. The island itself would remain unoccupied by either side. Isla de Perejil\u2019s non-occupation is now closely monitored by both the Moroccans and the Spanish (though it\u2019s unclear whether the Moroccan goatherd who occasionally used to graze his flock on the island now has to show his passport).\nApart from that, the case seems closed. But in this part of the world, few things are merely what they seem [3]. Known to the ancients as the Pillars of Hercules, the strategically important gateway between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean is laced with mirroring versions of history \u2014 a commodity in no short supply here. Those versions of history have even left mirroring border phenomena on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar.\nPerejil is one of seven Spanish territories on and off the Moroccan coast, once known collectively as \u201cplazas de soberan\u00eda.\u201d The two main ones are Ceuta and Melilla, two cities on the African mainland. Formerly called the \u201cMajor Plazas,\u201d they are now each enjoying a separate, autonomous status within Spain. The remaining \u201cMinor Plazas,\u201d apart from Perejil, are all garrisoned with Spanish soldiers: the Islas Chafarinas, a three-island archipelago near the Algerian border; Alboran, a flat and empty fleck of land flanked by tiny Isla de las Nubes; and finally Pe\u00f1\u00f3n [4] de Alhucemas (which includes the two minuscule islets called Isla de Tierra and Isla de Mar) and Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera, both on Morocco\u2019s central Mediterranean coast, not far from the city of El Hoceima. Morocco claims both autonomous cities and all of the plazas, except Alboran, 30 miles out to sea, the only bit of Spanish North Africa not hugging the Moroccan coastline.\nOpposite Ceuta, across the STROG [5], is Gibraltar (\u201cGib\u201d in British parlance), captured by the British in 1704 and granted to them \u201cin perpetuity\u201d by the Treaty of Utrecht, which ended the War of Spanish Succession in 1713. The Spanish have never accepted the loss of Gibraltar, besieging it on three occasions and most recently blockading it from 1969 to 1985.\nIt seems illogical, not to mention a bit petty, of the Spanish to demand the return of Gibraltar while they cling to their toeholds on the Moroccan side. But Spain\u2019s position is cherry-picked from two opposing principles: Either occupying strategic bits of another country\u2019s coast is an affront to its territorial integrity, in which case Spain can rightly claim Gibraltar but has to renounce its plazas and autonomous cities in North Africa, or Spain\u2019s historic rights to those places can be maintained forever, in which case the same applies for British sovereignty over Gibraltar.\nNaturally, Spain has an internally consistent way out of this conundrum: Ceuta and Melilla were Spanish cities long before present-day Morocco existed [6], so it can\u2019t claim them. But Gibraltar was ripped from the bosom of the Spanish state and has been a British colony ever since \u2014 in fact, the last colony on European soil [7]. And what should happen to colonies? Right, they should be decolonized.\nAnother solution, examined first by the British in 1917 and then proposed independently by Spain\u2019s King Alfonso in 1926, was an exchange between Spain and Britain, with Gibraltar reverting to Spain and Ceuta (and possibly also Melilla) becoming British. The swap would have been an interesting new chapter in the long association of Ceuta and Gibraltar. Both exclaves, barely 14 miles apart, poke into the strait, guarding this chokepoint of naval traffic between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Seen from above, they look like the hinges of a door that can be opened and shut by whomever controls them. Seen from the sea, Gibraltar\u2019s Rock and Ceuta\u2019s Monte Hacho [8] could be mistaken for the northern and southern pillars of a gigantic gate.\nIn fact, both rocks are the actual Pillars of Hercules known to the ancients, named after the legendary hero because they marked the westernmost extent of his 12 Labors. To the Greeks and Romans, the Pillars of Hercules were the proverbial end of the world. Tradition has it that the inscription on them warned \u201cNec Plus Ultra,\u201d or \u201cBeyond this, there\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nThat changed when Columbus brought back news of lands beyond the ocean, and riches beyond compare. The personal badge of Emperor Charles V, who ruled Spain soon after the discovery of the Americas, showed both pillars interwoven with the slogan: \u201cPlus Ultra\u201d \u2014 \u201cThere is more out there,\u201d the perfect motto for a nascent transatlantic empire. Charles\u2019s badge is at the origin of Spain\u2019s coat of arms (which still shows both pillars), and possibly also of the dollar sign [9] \u2014 the two vertical bars being abstract renderings of Gibraltar and Ceuta, and the curling motto reduced to the S-shape that connects them.\n(Nec) Plus Ultra: the pillars as endpoint or gateway. Again, two competing versions of history. And Ceuta and Gibraltar are connected by yet another history with two wildly differing versions. Early in the Eighth Century, Julian [10], a count tasked with \u201cholding Ceuta for Christendom,\u201d switched sides, exhorting and aiding the Muslim invaders of North Africa to cross the strait to Spain. The Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula began when their general Tariq ibn Ziyad landed at Mons Calpe in 711, henceforth renamed Jebel Tariq \u2014 i.e. Gibraltar.\nLegend has it that Julian wanted revenge for the honor of his daughter Florinda, ravished by Roderic, the last Visigoth king of Spain. Muslim sources later described her as innocence incarnate, while Christian scribes depicted her as a loose woman \u2014 respectively maximizing and minimizing Julian\u2019s casus belli. In Spanish history, Julian is the ultimate traitor, opening up the country to seven centuries of Moorish rule. But in his 1970 novel \u201cCount Julian,\u201d the Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo takes the alleged traitor\u2019s side, relishing in the destruction of Spain.\nExamples of this mutability of allegiance persist across the strait. Spain\u2019s claims to Gibraltar are supported by \u2026 Morocco \u2014 for surely, a return of Gib to Spain must mean a return of Ceuta to Morocco. Spain\u2019s claims to Perejil are supported by Algeria, Morocco\u2019s unfriendly neighbor, but not by Spain\u2019s fellow European Union member France, Morocco\u2019s former colonial overlord.\nPerhaps Gibraltar is the northernmost part of Africa, for its Barbary Macaques are the only monkeys living in the wild in Europe [11]. And maybe Melilla is the southernmost city of Europe, because its Capilla de Santiago (St James\u2019s Chapel) is the only gothic church in Africa.\nAll the while, the peculiar borders of these exclaves persist, and harden and soften according to circumstance. Spain and Britain\u2019s co-membership of the European Union was instrumental in ending the blockade of Gibraltar, normalizing the border at La Linea \u2014 no longer a three-quarter mile strip of no man\u2019s land garnished with barbed wire.\nRelated\nMore From Borderlines\nRead previous contributions to this series.\nBut the persistent disagreement between Spain and Morocco over the plazas, coupled with an increase in undocumented migration from Africa into Europe, has put Spain on the spot. For many thousands of poor Africans seeking a better life in Europe, Ceuta and Melilla are the entry points into the First World. The barbed-wire fence around both territories is hardly an impediment for those daring and hardy enough to trek across the Sahara.\nSome in Spain suspect the periodic surges of migrants into its two African cities are co-orchestrated by Morocco, to underscore their untenability as Spanish, and EU, exclaves in Africa. But ironically, the surges more likely result from the improved Spanish surveillance of the strait, which many migrants try to cross. Like the flow of a river, the phenomenon of mass migration simply seeks the most convenient channel for its course. Hence the poor, huddled masses of boat people reaching Italy\u2019s southernmost island Lampedusa, and likewise the Canary Islands, Spain\u2019s archipelago off Morocco\u2019s Atlantic coast.\nFor them too, the Strait of Gibraltar no longer is the Nec Plus Ultra of their dreams.\nFrank Jacobs is a London-based author and blogger. He writes about cartography, but only the interesting bits.\n[1] The official Moroccan nomenclature is \u201cTura,\u201d which in Berber means \u201cuninhabited,\u201d but also used is \u201cLeila,\u201d which probably is a loan from the Spanish \u201cla isla\u201d (\u201cthe island\u201d).\n[2] In full: status quo ante bellum, \u201cthe state of things before the war.\u201d This principle of international law holds that territorial conquest in battle should be nullified after the end of hostilities. The opposite principle, used to justify territorial gains, is uti possidetis \u2014 in full, uti possidetis, ita possideatis, \u201cas you possessed [it], you shall possess [it] from now on.\u201d\n[3] For starters, how about the intriguing similarities between the Parsley Incident and the Falklands War, fought two decades earlier? Both involve failed attempts by former European colonies to reclaim islands off their coast held by former European superpowers. Kennedy-Lincoln assassination similarity buffs, start your engines!\n[4] Literally a crag (a steep rocky outcrop), the Spanish word pe\u00f1\u00f3n has also come to mean a Spanish military outpost at such a location. Apart from the two mentioned here, other examples include the Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Argel (i.e. Algiers), occupied by Spain from 1510 to 1529.\n[5] Naval speak for the Strait of Gibraltar.\n[6] 1640 and 1497, respectively. Morocco became independent from France in early 1956. Spanish Morocco \u2014 a protectorate since 1912 , not to be confused with the plazas \u2014 was allowed to join French Morocco in independence a few months later.\n[7] Gibraltar had the status of Crown Colony from 1830 to 1981; in 2002, it was re-classified as a British Overseas Territory. Gibraltar has its own elected government, and thus claims no longer to be a colony, but Spain resists attempts to remove it from the UN Special Committee on Decolonization\u2019s list of Non-Self-Governing Territories (16 at present, of which 10 are under British jurisdiction).\n[8] Elevations 1,400 and 670 feet respectively; another candidate for the southern pillar is the Jebel Musa (2,800 feet), just beyond Ceuta\u2019s border with Morocco.\n[9] The pillars were pictured on the reverse of the Spanish dollar, legal tender in the United States until 1857.\n[10] He might also have been called Urbano, or Ulban. He may have been a Berber, a Visigoth or a Byzantine. Perhaps he was the local ruler of Ceuta, or merely its governor.

One of the four firebombings, which took place in the Jamaica neighborhood on Sunday night, was aimed at an Islamic center in which 100 people were worshiping; the other attacks involved a home that houses a small Hindu temple, a bodega and a house on 107th Avenue. No injuries were reported.\nInvestigators are exploring whether the suspect had any previous contact with the bodega\u2019s owner, who was the victim of the first firebombing. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said the owner had told investigators about an episode on Dec. 27 in which he or his employees ejected a man who was trying to steal a Frappuccino and a container of milk.\nAs bodega workers were pushing the man out of the store, Mr. Kelly said, \u201cHe said words to the effect of, \u2018We\u2019re going to get even. We\u2019re going to get back at you.\u2019 \u201d\nA fifth Molotov cocktail attack took place in Elmont, just across the border in Nassau County, on Sunday night. Mr. Kelly said police detectives \u201cbelieve the same individual is responsible for all of the incidents.\u201d\nDuring the attack at the bodega, a man threw a lighted Molotov cocktail toward the counter, the police said, adding that the bottle did not break upon landing. Investigators believe it is likely that the shoplifter was the same man who returned with the incendiary device, and that the man\u2019s grudge against the bodega may have been the impetus for the attack, the official said.\nIf that is the case, investigators are trying to understand why the same man would have attacked the other locations, the official said.\nThe police have released a sketch of a suspect, as well as a video (see above) captured by a surveillance camera that shows the attack against the Hindu temple. In the video, a man in a hooded sweatshirt steps from a vehicle and hurls a Molotov cocktail, which ignites in a flash across the lawn of the home that housed the temple.\nThe police have been investigating the firebombings as possible bias attacks. Detectives zeroed in on the man in custody \u2014 who was not immediately identified or charged \u2014 because his car had been seen by a witness at the bodega and had been captured by security video at the Hindu house of worship, Mr. Kelly said.\nThe car has Virginia plates, though the police say they believe the man is from Queens.\n\u201cAttacks on houses of worship are particularly egregious,\u201d Mr. Kelly said, adding, \u201cThey endanger lives, but they also assail our religious freedoms.\u201d\nTim Stelloh contributed reporting.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Maybe he bagged the wrong bat or came into contact with an ailing chimp. Whatever the origin, he unsuspectingly becomes host to something deadly and unseen and unwittingly carries it back home across the river or the ocean.\nAnd then the pandemic begins.\nThis may read like a passage from a Richard Preston novel, but all an enterprising virus needs to do is jump aboard a traveling human or animal, and bam \u2014 the potential for a catastrophe akin to the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic could emerge.\nThat is why the Centers for Disease Control and the Wildlife Conservation Society decided to undertake their first surveillance efforts for diseases of animal origins crossing into the United States.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been recently, maybe in the last decade or so, that anybody has really recognized that wildlife has the potential to cause significant diseases in people,\u201d said Denise McAloose, the chief pathologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society and one of the authors of a paper published in PLoS ONE. \u201cIt was not until Ebola and other diseases that people said hey, we think we have a problem here.\u201d\nIn some cases, people infected in Africa starting in the 1970s had come into contact with carcasses of infected primates or with bats, which are thought to be the natural hosts of Ebola.\nIn 1999, the mosquito-borne West Nile virus was reported for the first time in North America and quickly spread across the continent, infecting thousands of people and ultimately causing nearly 500 deaths. It was an important milestone, raising concern about the potential of infectious agents to enter the United States in live animals or wildlife products.\nResearchers have long recognized that wildlife trade poses a serious risk to species survival, said Paul Calle, the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s director of zoological health, who was not involved in the study. But it is only more recently that public health experts have examined the problem through their lens, he added. \u201cPublic health and conservation concern converge on this issue,\u201d he said.\nNearly 75 percent of emerging infectious diseases have their origins in wildlife, among them SARS, H.I.V., the Nipah virus and H5N1 influenza. New infectious diseases do not occur just occasionally, Dr. McAloose explained, but pop up every other year or so.\nIn 2008, she and a group of colleagues set out to develop what is thought to be the country\u2019s first pilot project for screening bush meat for pathogens. Agents from Homeland Security and the C.D.C. confiscated African bush meat samples at several international airports, including in New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Atlanta and Houston. Some specimens were intercepted in the mail.\n\u201cWe started this project with the C.D.C. to see if there\u2019s any reason to be concerned,\u201d Dr. McAloose said.\nTissue samples from such appetizing hors d\u2019oeuvres as smoked monkey heads, dried bats and rat parts were sent to labs at Columbia University and the C.D.C. for analysis. The scientists tested for only a few pathogens, including the anthrax bacterium, herpes viruses, simian retroviruses. Researchers at the American Museum of Natural History used DNA bar-coding to firmly identify the species the tissues once belonged to.\nTheir analysis turned up four strains of simian foamy virus, an agent closely related to H.I.V., and two herpes viruses. The viruses occurred in samples of four different primate species, sometimes in combination.\nDr. McAloose emphasized that the study was quite small. Broader screening at ports of entry and tests for more viral varieties are likely to turn up additional pathogens, she said.The researchers plan eventually to include products originating in parts of the world like Asia, where wildlife trade is prominent.\nThe United States is one of the world\u2019s largest wildlife consumers, with J.F.K. International Airport in Queens seeing the most imports. From 2000 to 2006, approximately 1.5 billion live wild animals legally entered the country, as did about 55 million pounds of wildlife products. No one knows exactly how many animals or products enter the United States illegally each year, given the covert nature of the imports, but researchers suspect the number is substantial.\nThe United States Department of Agriculture regulates some exotic species that pose potential disease threats to livestock, and the C.D.C. restricts imports of some species of turtles, primates, bats, civets and rodents.\nSome of the animal species confiscated in the study are protected under the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the Endangered Species Act. Of 60 samples, two came from endangered chimpanzees, and two others came from threatened or vulnerable primate species.\nThe researchers hope their efforts will encourage more vigorous prosecution of those caught smuggling illegal wildlife goods.

Afterward, his lawyer, Eric G. Poulos, insisted that his client was not guilty of shooting the officer, Kevin Brennan, 29, of New Hyde Park, N.Y.\nThe arraignment featured none of the chaos that characterized Mr. Ortiz\u2019s departure from the 90th Precinct station house in Brooklyn on Wednesday, in which some of those who gathered outside, supporting Mr. Ortiz, directed expletives toward the police and punches toward photographers.\nOn Thursday, however, most members of the audience were displaying police badges; Mr. Ortiz\u2019s relatives and friends did not appear to be in attendance. Twice during the brief hearing, a court officer directed Mr. Ortiz to face Judge Charles Troia.\n\u201cThis was an assassination attempt by this defendant against Officer Brennan, who showed Herculean restraint\u201d in not firing his weapon, the prosecutor, Lewis Lieberman, said.\nOfficer Brennan, who was in critical but stable condition at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, was expected to recover; a police spokesman said the officer was talking and could recognize visitors.\nMr. Lieberman said that Mr. Ortiz had been identified by witnesses in three lineups, and that ballistics had matched a bullet removed from Officer Brennan\u2019s head with a gun found outside a window at 390 Bushwick Avenue, where Mr. Ortiz, according to the police, had gone to hide.\nA surveillance video from 370 Bushwick Avenue, where the shooting took place, showed Mr. Ortiz and Officer Brennan wrestling on the ground. Then, Mr. Lieberman said, the officer\u2019s body went limp, and Mr. Ortiz crawled away; he was then seen running to 390 Bushwick Avenue.\nPaul J. Browne, the Police Department\u2019s chief spokesman, said Mr. Ortiz \u201cmanaged to get his gun hand free and shoot Brennan at point-blank range behind his right ear.\u201d\nBut Mr. Poulos said that according to the prosecution\u2019s description of the video, which he had not viewed, the officer and Mr. Ortiz were only seen wrestling.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no statement that he did the shooting,\u201d Mr. Poulos said.\nThe police said Mr. Ortiz had a record of 14 arrests on various charges stemming from drugs or violence. He had been sought for questioning in a Jan. 1 murder.\nAt the start of the proceeding, Mr. Poulos expressed concern about allowing news photographers and video into the court, given the highly charged nature of the case. Ultimately, the judge decided to allow just one photographer and one television cameraman into the courtroom.\n\u201cThis was a political speech,\u201d Mr. Poulos said of the prosecution, later adding, \u201cWhat we should have heard were facts.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

And of the City. And of the Borough. And of an assortment of other entities that bring out the speech-making best and worst in many of our public figures.\nThe Day\nClyde Haberman offers his take on the news.\nThe progenitor of this exercise, of course, is the State of the Union address that the president delivers to Congress. The speaker, be he Democrat or Republican, invariably insists that everything on his watch is hunk-dory. Have you ever heard one of these guys say something on the order of, \u201cFolks, we\u2019re in a pickle,\u201d even if that is the reality?\n\u201cState of\u201d syndrome has assuredly spread. It is flourishing in New York, now more than ever.\nA few days into 2012, the governor gave his State of the State talk. The mayor followed with his State of the City speech.\nBecause New York is graced with five borough presidents, each of whom insists on being heard, we have been subjected to a series of State of the Borough spiels. The leaders of Queens and Staten Island spoke last week. Wednesday night was Brooklyn\u2019s turn, and Thursday will be Manhattan\u2019s. The Bronx will speak up later in February.\nBut wait, as they say on late-night television, there\u2019s more. The City Council speaker will deliver her take on the State of the City next week. A week later, the city comptroller plans for the first time to give a speech of his own.\nNor are city agencies immune to \u201cState of\u201d fever. In the not-distant past, a parks commissioner insisted on delivering a State of the Parks address, though the man now in that job speaks to his troops without making it a public spectacle.\nAccording to a City Hall spokesman, the only department chief who offers a true \u201cState of\u201d talk is the police commissioner. This year\u2019s could be interesting if it is totally frank.\nOn one hand, the Police Department can applaud itself for keeping crime levels at or near record lows. On the other, the department has lately had a succession of black eyes, some self-administered, from questions about its surveillance of Muslims to, most recently, a video of four officers beating and kicking a drug suspect in the Bronx.\nEven a Police Department antagonist, the Occupy Wall Street movement, seems unable to resist the \u201cState of\u201d urge. On Monday night, at a bookstore in SoHo, it held an event called the \u201cState of the Occupation Address.\u201d\nNeedless to say, resemblances to Lincoln are few. Mr. L needed only 270 words or so at Gettysburg to deliver the most cherished speech in American history. In the main, New York politicians are incapable of even clearing their throats in 270 words.\nOn the plus side, not everyone succumbs to this compulsion. The Assembly speaker and the State Senate majority leader got a few minutes to say their piece before the governor\u2019s State of the State, but no full-throated speeches by them are in store. That\u2019s probably just as well. Who wants to hear them justify their newly unveiled redistricting plans, widely panned as giving gerrymandering a bad name?\nPlainly, the \u201cState of\u201d rigmarole has been turned into a ritual that is performed every year for the politicians\u2019 greater glory. Even the State of the Union, a display of political theater to its core, doesn\u2019t have to be an annual ceremony. Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution says only that the president \u201cshall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the Union.\u201d\nFrom time to time. And if he skipped a year, what? Would the republic collapse?\nCertainly, the same might be asked of the state and the city.\nArrangements for these speeches have become elaborate \u2014 almost regal, some would say. That isn\u2019t how it once was. With the State of the Union, most presidents before Woodrow Wilson a century ago merely sent a written report to Congress.\nWouldn\u2019t it be refreshing if New York\u2019s leaders returned to something as simple as that. Given the shrinkage of attention spans, they might try delivering no more than a few choice words. Why not via Twitter?", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

A gallery of contributors count the ways.\nThe series is featuring occasional works of fiction. This is one.\n~ ~ ~\nOne afternoon, when I was 8 years old, I went into my parents\u2019 bedroom and found a coin in the top drawer of their bureau. It was very heavy and had ancient markings written in Arabic or Hebrew or Chinese. I thought it was beautiful and stole it and hid it in the steamer trunk in the back of my closet.\nAnd that was the beginning. Whenever my parents were out, I\u2019d go into their bedroom and rummage through their drawers and closets. I stole my mother\u2019s gold arrow pin, a glass statuette of a unicorn, a money clip with my father\u2019s initials on it, a very small pair of old rimless reading glasses and a ceramic thimble with a picture of a blue rabbit.\nSometimes my mother would ask, \u201cDid you see my beaded necklace?\u201d Or my father would say: \u201cI can\u2019t seem to find my blue striped tie. Do you know where it is?\u201d\nI felt they knew I was stealing from them but were reluctant to confront me.\nThen one day I found, in the bottom drawer of my father\u2019s desk, a red silk pouch with a gold braided drawstring. Inside were small black-and-white photographs. Using the magnifying glass from my stamp collection,\nI studied these old pictures in which I appeared as a small child but did not recognize any of the people around me.\nIn one, wearing a sailor\u2019s suit, I was with a group of bearded men in dark coats, big hats and stern faces standing in a forest.\nIn another, three people were gathered together in the snow, one holding me in his arms and standing with his foot on a frozen dead cow, smiling at the camera.\nIn another, I was harnessed to a baby\u2019s highchair in the company of a group of people sitting at a table in an outdoor cafe. They were sipping coffee and laughing and waving at the camera, while the cafe behind them was on fire.\nThe last photo was taken in a dimly lit nightclub. A man, sitting at a white piano, wearing a bandanna, was accompanying a couple dancing the tango in a very sexually provocative way. On the far wall, I observed a large mural of the baby Jesus. The face of the Christ child bore an uncanny resemblance to the face of the child in the other photos, and I wondered why I\u2019d been chosen to represent Christ in an Argentine dance club. But I couldn\u2019t ask my parents about the pictures, because it would have revealed that I\u2019d been stealing from them.\nMeanwhile, I began to notice that some of my own possessions were disappearing bit by bit \u2014 a toy soldier, a harmonica, my favorite pair of beat-up sneakers, a boxcar from my electric train and my autographed baseball cards of Bo Hoskins and Victor Kessel.\nAs more of my things disappeared, I became even more compulsive about stealing from my parents. I stole pendants, lockets, coffee cups, two miniature landscape paintings, a few small cushions from the couch, four incandescent bulbs from the ceiling track lighting and little beads of glass, one by one, from the chandelier in the living room.\nOver the course of a few months, the walls in the apartment grew barer and the furniture seemed more exposed, and the house became darker. It happened so gradually that my parents didn\u2019t seem to notice. At the same time, more of my own things continued to disappear. For everything I took away, something was taken from me, as though an undeclared war was in progress.\nAs we sat at the dinner table talking about the day\u2019s events, my father would stare at me with his brow furrowed, looking around the room to see if anything else was missing, while my mother twirled her hair and drummed her fingers on the table.\nThere seemed to be an unspoken sense of suspicion, fear, rage, betrayal, the feeling of an imminent explosion, as if we were teetering on the brink of violence, but none of us could confront the other; and in this atmosphere, I still managed to slip the pewter saltshaker into my pocket. Then, when I returned to my room, I found that my bicycle was missing.\nBy this time, I had taken to wearing a fishing jacket with multiple pockets, in order to stash even more items, and by the end of the day I\u2019d have books, figurines, shoes, socks and gloves, and the steamer trunk in the back of my closet was so crammed with contraband that it seemed about to burst.\nOne evening, I noticed my parents had put up two surveillance cameras, one in the living room, the other in the kitchen, and posted a uniformed guard at their bedroom door.\nThat night, I put my chair and desk against my own bedroom door, boarded up the windows and placed a tripwire attached to a spring-loaded catapult that would hurl a firebomb at the slightest turn of my doorknob. As I waited, I continued to obsess about the pictures of me as a child, taken with members of an unrecognizable family.\nRelated\nMore From Anxiety\nRead previous contributions to this series.\nFinally, I cracked. I marched into the living room, where my mother was dusting a table and my father was sitting on the couch.\n\u201cWhy did you leave those pictures of me as a child with people who are completely unfamiliar to me?\u201d I said. \u201cWas it to suggest that I have no part in your lives? Or were you trying to drive me crazy?\u201d\n\u201cAnd so, there we have it! An admission!\u201d my father shouted. \u201cYou were the one who started this.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m a child,\u201d I said \u201cYou\u2019re adults. You should have explained to me that stealing was wrong. Instead, you started stealing from me. Now I\u2019ll never be able to trust anyone. I\u2019m only 8 years old, and my entire way of looking at the world has been corrupted. Why did you do this to me? Did you think it would make me stronger? Did you think if you exposed me to betrayal, that you were tempering me to be able to face the realities of life?\u201d\nMy father\u2019s face reddened, and my mother began to cry.\nFinally, I came around to the subject that had been haunting me.\n\u201cAnd why am I the only recognizable person in the pictures you had hidden away? Who are those people? Are you really my parents, or was I adopted?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d my father said. \u201cWhat pictures?\u201d\nI went to my room and returned with the red silk pouch. Using my flashlight and magnifying glass, my parents examined the photos. \u201cYes, it is you,\u201d my father said. But neither of my parents recognized the other people, either.\nWe all shared a sense of wonder and bewilderment and retired to the kitchen to get something to eat. But the refrigerator was empty because I\u2019d stolen everything in it, and there was only one chair left in the dinette.\nNone of us had eaten for three days, so we decided to go to a restaurant around the corner. We felt a sense of hope that together, as a loving family, we would solve the mystery.\nJoe Frank has written, produced and performed more than 200 radio programs for KCRW in Santa Monica, Calif., and National Public Radio.

These global systems work only because of something called virtualization, a kind of software that tricks one server into doing the tasks of several. The cost savings and flexibility revolutionized the data management business, since virtualized machines can run on cheap semiconductors.\nHigh-price networking gear still ties together most data centers, however. Companies pay for it because managing data traffic is tougher than mere computation. Now a small company called Nicira, along with a few other scrappy players, is pursuing what is called software-defined networking, which should cut costs and make equipment more efficient.\nA software-defined network, which originated in government spy agencies, is similar to server virtualization, and because of that is quite likely bad news for networking equipment makers like Cisco and Juniper Networks. If proprietary systems can be mixed together and cheap chips used in place of custom semiconductors, prices for the gear would most likely will drop.\nNicira claims savings of up to $37 million in a facility with 40,000 servers, and 50 percent cost reductions in setting up the fastest networks. Customers from big phone companies, large Internet service providers and computer makers think they can exceed the kind of cost savings Google has achieved in its large data centers.\n\u201cExtremely powerful computing is going to get cheaper and cheaper and cheaper,\u201d said Lew Moorman, the president of Rackspace, a company with 161,000 customers using its cloud. It has been working with Nicira since 2009. \u201cFacebook and Google run their applications at a massive scale; we\u2019ll let tens of thousands of companies do whatever they want too, on the fly.\u201d\nOther Nicira customers include AT&T, which is spending $1 billion a year on its cloud. AT&T wants its software engineers to be able to quickly build new personalized features for 100 million or more mobile phone customers. By interacting with several parts of the AT&T cloud, it might be possible for customers to send automatic texts to their friends, for instance when they are stuck in traffic.\nJapan\u2019s NTT, the big phone company, has used it to automatically reconfigure a computer center\u2019s thousands of machines, enabling it to take on the workload of a center in the middle of a tsunami. EBay can use it to better manage workloads or offer new sales applications across its network.\nMartin Casado, the company\u2019s co-founder and chief technical officer, began thinking about network virtualization in 2002, when he was working as a contractor for a United States intelligence agency. (He cannot say which one.) \u201cThey needed secure, isolated networks that shared the same infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cVirtualization means you have fewer machines and fewer cables. That is fewer points of entry they have to control.\u201d\nIt is tough to do. Networks are supposed to operate in real time, and many computing jobs cannot shift around a data center without manually changing things like security and processing-task priorities. Mr. Casado, who calls network virtualization \u201cthe hardest problem I\u2019ve looked at in my life,\u201d returned to Stanford and in 2007 finished a Ph.D. thesis on security management in big networks. The government gave Nicira its first $1.5 million soon after.\nThe product took four years of work by Mr. Casado and 20 other Ph.D.\u2019s from Google, M.I.T., Cornell and VMWare, a pioneer in server virtualization. They worked quietly, but last spring the company attracted a burglar who, according to surveillance tapes, broke into the building and walked straight to the desk of Nicira\u2019s principal engineer. The company, which thinks the burglar was most likely an agent of a foreign government, claims the man made off with a low-value testing server.\nA number of start-ups are betting big on network virtualization. Pica8 has a virtualized switch made with off-the-shelf chips that it claims can do the work of a $25,000 Cisco box for $3,000. VMWare, which already sells small-scale network virtualization, works with young switch vendors like Arista on building extremely large data centers.\n\u201cNicira is an element we can work with,\u201d said Paul Maritz, VMWare\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere will be tens of thousands of big clouds defined by software, and they\u2019ll be easy to set up.\u201d\nBoth Cisco and Juniper say that they are already in the network virtualization game, but say there is still plenty of space for their custom systems. \u201cWe have been in the forefront of driving network virtualization and programmability,\u201d Ram Velaga, a Cisco vice president, wrote in an e-mail. \u201cWe continue to evolve those technologies.\u201d Juniper is also pushing more software-intensive systems but, like Cisco, it uses custom chips.\nThe incumbents may have a while left to contend with the upstarts, because of some deeply held loyalties. Despite its long interest in Nicira, Mr. Casado says his old friends in the intelligence community are not yet customers. \u201cThey are the most conservative and slow-moving people you can find, as far as technology cycles go,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cCompanies like NTT and Rackspace are in a rush.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

After the facility goes up in smoke, the culpable Israeli character dismisses it with a shrug as just \u201canother mysterious explosion in Iran,\u201d a clear reference to a string of deadly attacks on Iranian scientists and installations that have been attributed to Israel.\nUnfortunately for Samsung, the South Korean electronics firm, it was identified as the originator of the ad in Iran. One outraged Iranian official demanded an apology and even suggested that a ban on Samsung products might be in order. The company quickly issued a statement stressing that the ad had been produced in Israel \u201cwithout Samsung\u2019s knowledge or participation.\u201d\nAs The Korea Herald reports, the confusion over the ad comes at a time of strained relations between Iran and South Korea. Last month, after South Korea decided to take part in international sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, the Iranian government \u201cdemanded Korean firms, including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, tear down their outdoor advertising billboards in Tehran.\u201d\nWhile the official version of the Israeli ad has disappeared, a number of copies of it remain on YouTube. One, which includes English subtitles and annotation, explains that the ad ends with a Hebrew pun that Iran\u2019s theocratic leadership is unlikely to find funny.\nAt the very end of the clip, one of the Israeli characters hiding out in an Isfahan cafe swats a bug that landed on him and exclaims, \u201cIck, Khomeini!\u201d As Ben Hartman explained in The Jerusalem Post:\n\u201cKhomeini\u201d is Israeli slang for Maladera insanabilis, a beetle drawn to the light of Tel Aviv stairwells during the summer. The pesky winged beetle acquired the name because the species is believed to have been accidentally imported to Israel in the late 1970s by a traveler returning from Iran.\nMr. Hartman also noted that this is not the first time an Israeli company has joked about assassinations thought to have been carried out by Israel\u2019s intelligence agents. As The Lede reported in 2010, an Israeli supermarket chain illustrated the slogan \u201cWe offer killer prices,\u201d with fake surveillance camera images of actors dressed to look like the suspects accused of assassinating a Hamas official in Dubai that year.\nWriting on the Israeli Web magazine +972 on Sunday, Ami Kaufman drew attention to another current ad campaign, for Subaru, that makes light of conflict between Israelis and their neighbors. The Subaru print and Internet ad plays on the graffiti scrawled by Israeli settlers who take credit for attacks on Palestinian mosques by writing the Hebrew words for \u201cPrice Tag\u201d on the walls.\nAs Mr. Kaufman explained, the ad, which appeared in Israel\u2019s leading newspaper on Sunday, refers to the price tag of a car with the words written in graffiti, \u201con a brick wall that looks pretty much like any brick wall you would find belonging to your typical West Bank mosque.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Until now, the F.A.A. has sought limits on the use of drones in national airspace because of concerns that the devices did not have sufficient safety mechanisms to prevent midair collisions.\nBut the F.A.A. bill would sharply curtail those limits, and civil liberties groups are in an uproar over potential privacy concerns posed by the drones \u2013 some of which are as small as a hummingbird and can be equipped with infrared and video cameras as well as radar.\n\u201cOur main concern is that this technology is growing by leaps and bounds,\u201d said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019d like to see rules put in place.\u201d\nMr. Stanley is the co-author of a Dec. 15 report calling for drones not to be deployed unless the government has obtained a warrant and \u201cthere are grounds to believe that they will collect evidence on a specific crime.\u201d Americans \u201cdon\u2019t want to have to worry that every time we step out our front door that we are going to be tracked,\u201d he said.\nThe legislation is part of a larger bill authorizing $63.4 billion in financing over four years for the F.A.A. that was passed by the House on Friday and is headed to President Obama, who is expected to sign it into law.\nThe aircraft, which can be controlled by remote or operate on their own, are already being used for surveillance by some local and state law enforcement authorities.\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection uses drones to patrol the nation\u2019s borders, and authorities in Texas have used them in drug investigations.\n\u201cUnfortunately, nothing in the bill would address the very serious privacy issues raised by drone aircraft,\u201d Mr. Stanley wrote on the A.C.L.U.\u2019s blog. \u201cThis bill would push the nation willy-nilly toward an era of aerial surveillance without any steps to protect the traditional privacy that Americans have always enjoyed and expected.\u201d\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil-liberties and digital-rights group in San Francisco, is also apprehensive about the impact of drones on privacy. The foundation filed a lawsuit last month against the United States Department of Transportation, demanding that the agency release information on which entities have been given authorization to use drone aircraft and why.\nAny public entity \u2013 like law enforcement agencies or state universities \u2013 seeking to fly unmanned aerial vehicles at a height above 400 feet must obtain certification from the F.A.A. (which is part of the Transportation Department). The government has not yet publicly released a comprehensive list of the entities holding these certifications, but the F.A.A. acknowledged that it had issued hundreds of such authorizations by the end of 2010.\nJennifer Lynch, a lawyer with the foundation, said after the bill\u2019s passage, \u201cI think now more than ever the public is entitled to see the records we are suing the F.A.A. to get.\u201d\nProponents of drone technology maintain that it has become useful in criminal investigations and immigrations enforcement, offering a cheaper and less obtrusive alternative to helicopters. Customs and Border Patrol, for example, says on its Web site that it has achieved \u201cunprecedented success in homeland security, law enforcement and in support of disaster relief efforts\u201d with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles.\nBut Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy in Washington and a senior analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, expressed concerns about safety as well as privacy.\n\u201cThe use of drones domestically raises a whole range of questions that have hardly been asked, let alone answered,\u201d Mr. Aftergood said in an e-mail. \u201cWhat is the probable impact of drone operations on personal privacy? What are the worst-case safety consequences of a drone failure? What is the current and future role of drones in domestic military operations?\u201d\nWhen asked about the drone measure, Laura Brown, an F.A.A. spokeswoman, said, \u201cThis is something we are not really in a position to comment on right now.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

But after that sugar high came Super Bowl Sunday, followed by Grammy Awards Sunday, and \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d had to take a two-week vacation.\nYour natural expectation in that situation is that the show will come back for the final third of the season with something new and exciting, perhaps a real dive back into the Florrick family circus. But \u201cLive From Damascus\u201d on Sunday had no Peter, no Jackie, no Zach and Grace. Instead, the show came out of its short hiatus with more Perils of Will, which felt like a letdown.\nThere was a shocker, though, at least for those who avoid spoilers: faced with disbarment immediately after escaping indictment (he got the bad news at his you\u2019re-not-going-to-trial celebratory party), Will decided to take the high road and accept a six-month suspension. This odd fatalism came despite Diane\u2019s best back-channel efforts to save him. He came to his decision after a sit-down with Alicia, that moral bellwether. She told him to fight, but apparently her mere presence was enough to convince him that accepting punishment (for his long ago misappropriation of a client\u2019s money) was the right thing to do. Or maybe he just couldn\u2019t stand to be in the office with Alicia.\nNot that Josh Charles, who plays Will, is leaving the show, of course. In fact, Elizabeth Reaser is scheduled to make an appearance this spring as his sometime girlfriend Tammy. We\u2019d love to hear your speculation about how the show will handle Will\u2019s suspension: a lightning reinstatement? Unexpected jealousy as Alicia becomes closer to Diane? A trip to spring training?\nIn the case of the week, the show indulged its tastes for moralizing and melodrama by going after an American tech company whose surveillance software is being used by the Syrian government. (Did anyone else feel that the extensive use of what was presented as footage from the continuing Syrian protests was a little exploitative and queasy-making in this context?)\nIt provided an opportunity for Will, as lead lawyer, to exercise his idealism in counterpoint to the decision he had to make about his own career. The writers made a pointless and distracting decision to put Denis O\u2019Hare\u2019s Judge Abernathy in an emotional state over the Occupy protests going on nearby, and the ending \u2014 contrasting the rescue of an American protester with the disappearance of a Syrian fixer working for Lockhart Gardner \u2014 was pat and not quite up to the show\u2019s standards.\nIt was one of the episodes in which Alicia was mostly in the background, but a major plot line that\u2019s coming up did click into place: out of nowhere \u2014 as far as I can remember, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong \u2014 we found out that Will had been preparing to defend Kalinda in a mysterious case involving taxes, and that now Alicia will have to take it over. So sisterhood will be tested once again. Another to look forward to, perhaps: it was recently announced that Matthew Perry will join the cast next month.\nThe best line of the episode had nothing to do with Will, Alicia, Kalinda or disbarment. It came in the comic-relief subplot involving the triangle of Eli Gold, his ex-wife and his frenemy Stacie Hall, when Amy Sedaris (Stacie) said to Alan Cumming (Eli): \u201cLast night was amazing.

The maximum penalty for the violation was $300, which Mr. Bromberg would be forced to pay if he failed to appear at an Environmental Control Board hearing on Feb. 14, the summons said.\nUnlike most recipients of the 262,426 tickets that were issued by the city\u2019s Sanitation Department in 2011, Mr. Bromberg had a security camera posted on the exterior of his property. He showed up at his hearing with a laptop that contained downloaded surveillance footage from the time of his summons.\nBeverly Kalman, an administrative law judge for the Environmental Control Board, promptly dismissed his ticket.\nThe video, Judge Kalman said, showed that there were no cans in front of Mr. Bromberg\u2019s house at the time that the officer issued the summons.\nMr. Bromberg\u2019s case was one of three mentioned during a news conference on Monday in which Brooklyn residents who had received sanitation summonses used videotapes of the encounters to prove their innocence and have their summonses dismissed.

Goldman received a $20 million fee for playing matchmaker for El Paso. The fee, of course, was not disclosed, nor was the Kinder Morgan stake owned by Goldman Sachs\u2019s private equity arm, worth some $4 billion.

Booker of Newark were each apparently unaware of the monitoring efforts in New Jersey being carried out by New York City police officers.\n\u201cOver the past several years, the New York Police Department has been engaged in surveillance of New Jersey\u2019s communities and universities, searching for those who might be accused of terror; Governor Christie, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, both \u2014 each apparently unaware of this large-scale investigation,\u201d Mr. Lautenberg said. \u201cHow can a law enforcement agency spy on another state\u2019s residents without notifying the authorities \u2014 the governor, the mayor, even knowing about it?\u201d\nMr. Holder said he did not know.\nBut he added that his office was reviewing the letters that \u201chave come in\u201d on those issues. In fact, Mr. Holder said that when he spoke with Mr. Christie at a reception a few days ago, the governor \u201cexpressed to me the concerns that he had,\u201d and that Mr. Christie has \u201cnow publicly expressed his concerns, as only he can.\u201d\nThen, Mr. Holder added: \u201cAnd I think, at least what I\u2019ve read publicly \u2013 and again, just what I\u2019ve read in the newspapers \u2013 is disturbing. And these are things that are under review at the Justice Department.\u201d\nIt was difficult to tell if Mr. Holder, in his comments, meant that he was disturbed over the New York Police Department\u2019s surveillance efforts or over the apparent lack of interstate communication and coordination, or both.\nAsked to clarify that point, Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokeswoman for Mr. Holder\u2019s office, said: \u201cThe department is aware of the allegations and we have received several requests to investigate the N.Y.P.D. As we have previously stated, the department is in the process of reviewing these requests. We decline further comment at this time.\u201d\nPaul J.

That assertion may turn out to be only partly true, which became clear for the first time here at the caucus meeting.\nRepublicans will gather across Missouri on Saturday to formally begin the arduous process of electing delegates in the presidential race. An early glimpse into the caucuses unfolded here in Brunswick, a small town about two hours east of Kansas City, which decided to hold its meeting two days before the rest of the state.\nThe first question of the evening was whether to bind delegates to the results of the February primary. The measure passed by a wide margin and no discussion, which sent four delegates on behalf of Mr. Santorum and none for Mr. Romney or Representative Ron Paul of Texas.\n\u201cAll of our county delegates will be bound to the popular vote for Chariton County,\u201d said Andrea Rice, the county Republican chairwoman, who presided over the meeting and announced the results. \u201cFour delegates will go for Rick Santorum.\u201d\nSeveral people wearing shirts for Mr. Paul did not openly object, but chatted among themselves and voted against the measure to bind the delegates. No one rose in objection on behalf of the Romney campaign, but Ms. Rice said later that a local Romney supporter was seated in the room and remained quiet.\nA spokesman for the Missouri Republican Party said Thursday evening that all counties have the option to use Mr. Santorum\u2019s victory in the primary as a starting point in their selection of delegates if they choose.\n\u201cThe default is unbound delegates, so it will take passage of a rule to bind them,\u201d said the spokesman, Jonathon Prouty. \u201cIt is likely that several counties will do so.\u201d\nMr. Santorum, who is making a quick campaign stop in Missouri on Friday morning, was the only candidate to campaign in the state last month. He spent money on television ads, while his rivals dismissed the primary as a beauty contest.\nThe proceedings on the second-floor of the Railyard Steakhouse drew 33 Republican voters, all of whom were asked to present their driver\u2019s licenses as they signed in a show of support for a voter identification law. The restaurant rumbled as a whistle sounded and a train rolled by, which went unnoticed by the local residents who were engaged in a deep discussion of local, state and national politics.\nThe strength for Mr. Santorum became clear in conversations with Republicans as they sliced their inch-thick prime rib and grilled pork chops here on Thursday evening at a Lincoln Dinner that preceded the caucus. There were no Santorum signs or banners, but several people said they believed he was the strongest conservative in the race.\n\u201cI like his values. He\u2019s one of us,\u201d said Duane Leimkuehler, 53, a corn, wheat and soybean farmer. He was elected as a delegate and said that he would proudly represent his county at the district and state conventions, but acknowledged that he was focused on defeating President Obama and eager for the Republican race to conclude.\n\u201cMitt Romney is not my first choice. He\u2019s getting support solely because he\u2019s the front-runner,\u201d Mr. Leimkuehler said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to unite at some point.\u201d\nThe outcome of the caucus here on Thursday night was not necessarily representative of the gatherings to be held across the state on Saturday. The Romney campaign is hoping to find its base of support in suburban St. Louis and Kansas City.\nHere in Chariton County, which is described by voters as deeply conservative, Mr. Romney carried 25 percent of the vote in the February primary and Mr. Santorum won 58 percent.\nBut the meeting, which lasted about 40 minutes from prayer to adjournment, provided a window into the county-by-county fight for delegates that the Republican presidential race has become.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It is a middle path, arguably the sanest choice of all: to be respected. That\u2019s where the department has been struggling of late, on several fronts.\nIts surveillance of Muslims as part of its counterterrorism strategy has led to a concerted pushback from Islamic groups. The huge numbers of New Yorkers affected by its stop-and-frisk policy, principally young African-Americans and Latinos, have produced cries of racism and legislative attempts to limit the practice. Its battles with Occupy Wall Street have generated criticism that it fails to respect the rights of those engaged in lawful dissent.\nAs if governed by a law of physics, that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, the Police Department has stood unyieldingly at 180 degrees from its opponents, refusing to give an inch.\nIf anything, it has begun punching back, as the commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, did last week when challenged with unfriendly questions at a City Council hearing. Depending on your point of view, the commissioner was either strikingly peevish or admirably resolute against lawmakers who offered criticism but no real solutions for containing violent crime.\nEither way, battle lines are being drawn, and that is rarely healthy.\nOne risk is losing sight of reality, which is that all these police strategies require that a proper balance be struck between security needs and civil-liberties imperatives. The only constant about the balance line is that it is constantly shifting.\nCivil-liberties groups tend to talk about the First Amendment in near-absolutist terms, but there is no evidence that most New Yorkers agree with the Occupy crowd that they have a constitutionally assured right to pitch tents, spread sleeping bags and in effect turn city parks into round-the-clock shantytowns. The protesters\u2019 almost theological insistence on bedding down in the parks has probably turned off many New Yorkers who would otherwise be sympathetic to the cause and are troubled by a police response that is at times heavy-handed.\nWith police street stops, which totaled nearly 700,000 last year, the numbers have grown geometrically over the last decade while crime has gone down arithmetically. The lack of proportionality partly explains the attacks on this practice, as does the racial nature of the stop-and-frisks.\nBut an uncomfortable truth is that most violent crime in the city \u2014 and nearly all murders \u2014 are perpetrated against African-Americans and Latinos by other African-Americans and Latinos. Any anticrime strategy, almost by definition, will primarily make targets of black and Hispanic men. And most elected officials seem disinclined to end the present policy. They would at most modify it. Only they don\u2019t say what sorts of numbers constitute a proper balance in their minds. Would 500,000 stops be O.K.? How about 200,000? Or 50,000?\nSimilar questions arise with the police watch on mosques and on Islamic organizations and Web sites. Singling out one religious group for monitoring is repugnant to many Americans, maybe most. But are the police supposed to ignore another uncomfortable reality, namely that the terrorist threat to New York comes principally from Islamists? We don\u2019t hear all that much about Unitarian suicide bombers.\nMr. Kelly\u2019s hand is strengthened by numbers that suggest most New Yorkers feel he is doing right. A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed that his approval rating was more than double his disapproval numbers. Latinos shared that view. The commissioner\u2019s standing was not as solid among African-Americans. Even so, more than half of them gave him a thumbs-up in the survey.\nThen again, constitutional rights are not decided by a popularity contest. Finding that elusive balance between security and civil liberties depends not on an opinion poll or political posturing but, rather, on reasonableness and good faith.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It was seen during routine surveillance by a fisheries patrol aircraft on Tuesday, she and other Canadian authorities said.\nA photograph provided by Canada\u2019s Department of National Defense showed the white boat adrift on the choppy, blue water, covered in streaks of orange rust.\n\u201cThe vessel is considered an obstruction to navigation, and a Notice to Shipping has been issued by the Canadian Coast Guard,\u201d Ms. Liu said in a statement, adding, \u201cThere are currently no reports of marine pollution from the vessel.\u201d\nMs. Liu also said the owner of the vessel had been made aware of its location and that \u201cclose visual aerial inspection and hails to the ship\u201d indicated that no one was onboard.\nHow quickly the boat reaches shore and where it lands are a \u201cfunction of the weather, obviously,\u201d said a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center of Victoria, British Columbia. \u201cIt could end up in Alaska,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would make my life easier.\u201d\nThe spokesman, who refused to provide his full name, confirmed in a telephone conversation that retrieving the boat was not considered a high priority since no one appeared to be on board. \u201cThe reality is that the ship is 150 miles offshore and not going anywhere quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been adrift for over a year.\u201d\nCurtis Ebbesmeyer, a Seattle-based oceanographer, also reached by phone, said he hoped the Japanese ship would catch the attention of the authorities at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and other agencies, who have been predicting that much of the debris from the Japanese tsunami would not arrive on the West Coast of the United States before 2013.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing my best to say that\u2019s not what I see,\u201d Mr. Ebbesmeyer said, adding that in his experience, similar vessels adrift on the ocean \u201ccan move at least 50 miles a day.\u201d\n\u201cJust one storm will bring it ashore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be ashore in two days.\u201d\nLast September, according to the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a Russian ship near the Midway Islands spotted another drifting Japanese vessel, a 20-foot boat from Fukushima, one of the areas most affected by last year\u2019s catastrophe.\nIn a call to the United States Coast Guard, a spokesman said the agency was aware of the fishing vessel off the British Columbia coast but was not planning any action unless the Canadian authorities requested help.\nAn earlier version of this post misstated the location of the fishing vessel as 150 nautical miles off the coast of Vancouver.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The weapons were disabled and came with no ammunition. But the Hungarian counter-terrorism police determined that they constituted a serious threat.\nThe dead-pan seizure of movie props made TEK the laughing stock of the world. As David Itzkoff joked in the pages of the New York Times, \u201cIf Hungary ever finds itself the target of an undead invasion, its police force should now be well supplied to defend the nation.\u201d\nFew have taken TEK seriously. But that is a big mistake. In fact, TEK seems to be turning into Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s own secret police. In less than two years, TEK has amassed truly Orwellian powers, including virtually unlimited powers of secret surveillance and secret data collection.\nThe speaker of the Parliament, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, now has his own armed guard too, since the Parliament yesterday passed a law that creates a separate armed police force accountable to the Parliament. It too has extraordinary powers not normally associated with a Parliamentary guard. The creation of this \u201cParlia-military\u201d gives Hungary the dubious distinction of having the only Parliament in Europe with its own armed guard that has the power to search and \u201cact in\u201d private homes.\nAbout the Parlia-military, more later. First, to TEK.\nTEK was created in September 2010 by a governmental decree, shortly after the Fidesz government took office. TEK exists outside the normal command structure of both the police and the security agencies. The Prime Minister directly names (and can fire) its head and only the interior minister stands between him and the direct command of the force. It is well known that the head of this force is a very close confidante of the Prime Minister.\nTEK was set up as an anti-terror police unit within the interior ministry and given a budget of 10 billion forints (about $44 million) in a time of austerity. Since then, it has grown to nearly 900 employees in a country of 10.5 million people that is only as big as Indiana.\nWhy was TEK necessary? When it was created, the government said that it needed TEK because Hungary would hold the rotating presidency of the European Union starting in January 2011. During the six months it held this office, Hungary could be expected to host many important meetings for which top anti-terrorism security would be necessary. But even though Hungary\u2019s stint in the EU chair is over, TEK has continued to grow.\nEyebrows were raised when J\u00e1nos Hajdu, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s personal bodyguard, was appointed directly by the prime minister to be the first head of this new agency. Since TEK\u2019s job also included guarding the prime minister, some believed that Orb\u00e1n had set up the office to get his trusted bodyguard onto the public payroll. Patronage turns out to be the least of the worries about TEK, however.\nTEK is now the sort of secret police that any authoritarian ruler would love to have. Its powers have been added slowly but surely through a series of amendments to the police laws, pushed through the Parliament at times when it was passing hundreds of new laws and when most people, myself included, did not notice. The new powers of TEK have received virtually no public discussion in Hungary. But now, its powers are huge.\nWhat can the TEK do?\nTEK can engage in secret surveillance without having to give reasons or having to get permission from anyone outside the cabinet. In an amendment to the police law passed in December 2010, TEK was made an official police agency and was given this jurisdiction to spy on anyone. TEK now has the legal power to secretly enter and search homes, engage in secret wiretapping, make audio and video recordings of people without their knowledge, secretly search mail and packages, and surreptitiously confiscate electronic data (for example, the content of computers and email). The searches never have to be disclosed to the person who is the target of the search \u2013 or to anyone else for that matter. In fact, as national security information, it may not be disclosed to anyone. There are no legal limits on how long this data can be kept.\nOrdinary police in Hungary are allowed to enter homes or wiretap phones only after getting a warrant from a judge. But TEK agents don\u2019t have to go to a judge for permission to spy on someone \u2013 they only need the approval of the justice minister to carry out such activities. As a result, requests for secret surveillance are never reviewed by an independent branch of government. The justice minister approves the requests made by a secret police unit operated by the interior minister. Since both are in the same cabinet of the same government, they are both on the same political team.\nTEK\u2019s powers were enlarged again in another set of amendments to the police law passed on 30 December 2011, the day that many other laws were passed in a huge end-of-year flurry. With those amendments, TEK now has had the legal authority to collect personal data about anyone by making requests to financial companies (like banks and brokerage firms), insurance companies, communications companies (like cell phone and internet service providers) \u2013 as well as state agencies. Data held by state agencies include not only criminal and tax records but also educational and medical records \u2013 and much more. Once asked, no private company or state agency may refuse to provide data to TEK.\nBefore December 2011, TEK had the power to ask for data like this, but they could only do so in conjunction with a criminal investigation and with the permission of the public prosecutor. After December 2011, their data requests no longer had to be tied to criminal investigations or be approved by the prosecutor. In fact, they have virtually no limits on what data they can collect and require no permission from anyone.\nIf an organization (like an internet service provider, a bank or state agency) is asked to turn over personally identifiable information, the organization may not tell anyone about the request. People whose data have been turned over to TEK are deliberately kept in the dark.\nThese powers are shocking, not just because of their scope, but also because most Hungarians knowledgeable about constitutional law would probably have thought they were illegal. After the changes of 1989, the new Hungarian Constitutional Court was quick to dismantle the old system in which the state could compile in one place huge amounts of personal information about individuals. In its \u201cPIN number\u201d decision of 1991, the Constitutional Court ruled that the state had to get rid of the single \u201cpersonal identifier number\u201d (PIN) so that personally identifiable data could no longer be linked across state agencies. The Court found that \u201ceveryone has the right to decide about the disclosure and use of his/her personal data\u201d and that approval by the person concerned is generally required before personal data can be collected. It was the essence of totalitarianism, the Court found, for personal information about someone to be collected and amassed into a personal profile without the person\u2019s knowledge.\nWith that Constitutional Court decision still on the books and not formally overruled, the Fidesz government is reproducing the very system that the Court had banned by creating a single agency that can gather all private information about individuals in one place again. What, one might ask, is left of constitutional law in Hungary?\nOne might also ask: Are there any limits to TEK\u2019s power?\nThe law specifies that TEK operates both as a police and as a national security agency. When it is acting as a police unit, it has the jurisdiction to spy on any person or group who poses a threat of terrorism, along with anyone else associated with such persons. Hungary, like many countries after 9/11, has a broad definition of terrorism that includes, among other things, planning to commit a \u201ccrime against the public order\u201d with the purpose of \u201ccoercing a state body . . . into action, non-action or toleration.\u201d Crimes against the public order include a long list of violent crimes, but also the vaguer \u201ccausing public danger.\u201d In addition, TEK also may arrest \u201cdangerous individuals,\u201d a term not defined in the criminal law. It is difficult from the text of the law itself to see any clear limits on TEK\u2019s powers.\nAnd TEK is very active. On April 7, TEK agents were called in to capture a young man in the small village of Kulcs who killed four members of his family with a machete. And then, in the early morning hours of Friday, April 13, TEK agents conducted a major drug bust in Budapest, arresting 23 people. According to news reports, fully 120 TEK agents were involved in the drug operation, raising questions about whether the drug bust was thought to be part of the anti-terrorism mission of the agency or a rather broad extension of the concept of the \u201cdangerous individual.\u201d Either way, the drug ring looked like garden-variety crime. If that is within TEK\u2019s jurisdiction, it is hard to imagine what is not.\nA You-Tube video of the April 13 drug bust, made available by TEK itself, shows what a middle-of-the-night raid by TEK officers looks like, complete with the use of heavy-duty tools to cut open an exterior door.\nGiven that this is the video that TEK wanted you to see, one can only imagine the activities of TEK that are not recorded for posterity. (It would be interesting to know, for example, why the audio cuts out at certain points in the clip, as well as what happens between the time that TEK breaks open the door and the time the various suspects are seen lying handcuffed on the floor.)\nWhile its videos are crystal clear, TEK\u2019s legal status is blurry, as some parts of its activities are authorized under the police law and others parts are authorized under the national security law. Different rules and standards apply to police agencies and to national security agencies. Moreover, TEK seems to have some powers that exceed those of both police and national security agencies, particularly in its ability to avoid judicial warrants. No other agency in the Hungarian government has both police and national security powers, and it is unclear precisely how the agency is accountable \u2013 for which functions, under what standards and to whom. What follows is my best guess from reading the law.\nWith respect to its powers authorized under the police law, it appears that TEK must act like the police and get judicial warrants to search houses, to wiretap and to capture electronic data when these activities are part of a criminal investigation. When TEK was arresting the machete-wielder and making the drug bust, it was probably acting under its police powers.\nBut TEK only need judicial warrants when it is engaged in criminal investigations. It doesn\u2019t need judicial warrants when it is using its secret surveillance powers in security investigations. When it is acting as a national security agency, TEK only needs the permission of the justice minister to engage in secret and intrusive surveillance. Of course, given that the permissions and constraints are different depending on whether TEK is acting as a police agency or a national security agency, it would matter who decides whether a particular activity is conducted for police or national security purposes and what the criteria are for determining that it is one or the other. The law does not provide the answer to either question.\nSuppose someone believes that she has been spied upon illegally by TEK. What can she do to object? First, if TEK is engaged in secret surveillance or data collection, it is unlikely that people will know that they are a target, given the extraordinary secrecy of the whole operation. But even if one finds out that one is being watched, the remedies are not encouraging.\nA person aggrieved by TEK\u2019s actions may complain to the interior minister, and the interior minister must answer the complaint within 30 days. But given that the interior minister is the minister who controls TEK in the first place, this is not an independent review. If the complainant does not like the answer of the interior minister, s/he may appeal to the Parliament\u2019s national security committee, which must muster a one-third vote to hear the petition. At the moment, the 12-member national security committee consists of two-thirds governing party members and one-third members of all other parties combined. If the governing party does not want to investigate a complaint, garnering a one-third vote would mean uniting the whole opposition \u2013 or, to put it in more blunt terms, getting the Socialists to work with the neo-Nazis. That is unlikely to happen. Even if the national security committee agrees to hear a petition, however, it would take a two-thirds vote of the committee to require the interior minister to reveal the surveillance methods used against the complainant so that the committee can determine whether they were legal. There is no judicial review at any stage of this process.\nTEK operates in secret with extraordinary powers and no one reliably independent of the current governing party can review what it is doing when it uses its most potentially abusive powers. This shocking accumulation of power may explain the Hungarian government\u2019s abolition of a separate data protection ombudsman who would have the power to investigate such shocking accumulation of data. Instead, the data protection officer \u2013 a post required by European Union law \u2013 has been made a political appointee of the government itself. This is why the EU has launched an infringement action against Hungary for failing to guarantee the independence of the office. Now we can see why the EU may be onto something.\nAs if the powers of TEK are not enough, though, Parliament yesterday authorized another security service with the power to use police measures against citizens and residents of Hungary. The cardinal law on the Parliament itself contains a provision that gives the Parliament its own military, a Parlia-military.\nThe Parlia-military is an armed police unit outside the chain of command of the regular military or police structures. Its commander in chief is the speaker of the house, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, who served as minister without portfolio for the Civilian Intelligence Services during the first Orb\u00e1n government from 1998-2002. The Parlia-military has the power to guard the Parliament and the speaker of the house, as might be expected. But if the Parlia-military is only supposed to guard the Parliament and the speaker, why does it need the powers that the cardinal law gives it?\nThe law gives the Parlia-military power \u201cto enter and to act in private homes.\u201d That\u2019s literally what the law says. It is unlikely that the Parliament will want to conduct a plenary session in someone\u2019s living room, so one must then wonder just what the Parliament will do if its armed military enters someone\u2019s home to \u201cact.\u201d In addition to this power, the Parlia-military may also make public audio and video recordings of people. It can also search cars, luggage and clothing. It can use handcuffs and chemical substances (which I assume means tear gas and nothing more, but the wording make it sound like the Parlia-military may use chemical weapons!). The draft law seems to imply that the Parlia-military would have to operate under the constraints of the police law, which would mean that it would need judicial warrants to conduct these intrusive measures. But that is not completely clear. What is clear is that Hungary now suffers from a proliferation of police that are under direct political control.\nUntil this point, I have thought that the Fidesz government was just attempting to lock down power for itself for the foreseeable future, which was bad enough. But now, with the discovery of these new security services, it seems increasingly likely that the Hungarian government is heading toward the creation of a police state. Actually, it may already be there. But shhhh! It\u2019s secret.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

A surge in the value of copper, iron and other metals has fueled a wave of thefts from sidewalks, roadways and rail yards in the last few months.\nOn Wednesday alone, the New York police arrested three men for stealing hunks of cast iron \u2014 grates made to protect tree roots and manhole covers weighing as much as 300 pounds. The arrests followed reports of the disappearance of dozens of the grates and covers across the city and came on top of a continuing spree of thefts of copper wire from utility cables.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about money,\u201d said Kevin Rafferty, president of Dublin Scrap Metal in Newark. \u201cThe economy\u2019s tough, and people are looking to sell whatever they can find to sell.\u201d\nMr. Rafferty, who said his company would not buy manhole covers or pieces of train rail that people showed up with, said the run-up in the prices of metals could also be driving up thefts. Still, he said, stealing a manhole cover from a city street is a true sign of desperation. Iron is worth only about 15 cents a pound, compared with about $3 a pound for copper, he said.\nThat disparity helps to explain why utility companies like Consolidated Edison usually have to contend with thefts of copper-filled cables far more often than the pilfering of manhole covers. Last year, Con Ed counted 133 thefts of its cable and just 2 stolen manhole covers.\nBut that was before Andrew Modica came along, the police say. On Wednesday night, detectives in Brooklyn arrested Mr. Modica, 46, in connection with the thefts of dozens of Con Ed\u2019s manhole covers in Brooklyn and Queens.\nInside a stolen Ford pickup truck with stolen Connecticut plates, the police said, they found a hydraulic jack and two J-shape metal hooks that Mr. Modica used to hoist the covers from roadbeds into the truck. He admitted that he had taken more than 15 of the missing covers and sold them for about $30 each to two scrap yards in the city, the police said. To avoid suspicion, Mr. Modica wore a reflective vest like the ones used by Con Ed repair crews, the police said.\nThe police declined to identify the buyers of the manhole covers.\nMr. Modica, it turns out, had firsthand knowledge of how to remove manhole covers because he had worked for a company that replaced them for Con Ed. That company, Safeway Construction Enterprises in Maspeth, Queens, employed him until late last year, said Shuta Waki, a manager with Safeway. Mr. Waki would not discuss the circumstances under which Mr. Modica left the company.\nMr. Waki said removing manhole covers \u201cwas part of his job.\u201d But Mr. Modica would have been working with one or two other men to lift the covers. He expressed doubt that Mr. Modica could have taken the covers by himself and was surprised to hear that the police said Mr. Modica had left open manholes that posed hazards to drivers and pedestrians.\nCon Ed officials were also dubious that Mr. Modica had worked alone. \u201cTo a lot of people here, it was quite surprising that it was one person who was doing this,\u201d said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman. He said the company believed Mr. Modica was responsible for the bulk of the missing covers, but \u201cwe\u2019re certainly not going to assume that there aren\u2019t other people out there who might try to do the same thing.\u201d\nMr. Modica was charged with possession of stolen property, reckless endangerment, petit larceny and criminal impersonation, the police said.\nHe was the third man arrested on Wednesday for taking molded metal off the streets. Early that morning, a police officer in Midtown Manhattan stopped a van and found three grates that had protected trees on West 48th Street. The driver admitted that he had previously stolen at least a dozen similar grates from the sidewalks along 46th Street between Eighth and 10th Avenues, the police said.\nA passenger in the van was wearing a reflective vest that belonged to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, although he did not work for that agency, the police said.\nBusiness owners along that stretch of 46th Street, known as Restaurant Row, were so distressed about the absence of the grates and fearful that pedestrians would trip over the unprotected tree pits that the Times Square Alliance had offered a $1,000 reward for help catching the thieves. Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance, said that a witness had provided some information to the police about the thefts but that he did not yet know if the person would receive a reward.\nThe scrap metal industry has a system for spreading word of the theft of metal items, like the load of used rail spikes and rail plates that disappeared from a New Jersey Transit rail yard in Raritan, last month. But Mr. Rafferty said that even a vigilant metals buyer would have trouble spotting unmarked pieces, like the tree grates, buried in a truckload of junk.\nKevin Lawlor, a spokesman for the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a trade organization in Washington, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like to put the onus on the scrap dealer to make decisions about what\u2019s stolen or not stolen.\u201d Still, Mr. Lawlor said, \u201cThe manhole covers is a unique situation because people should know that everyday citizens don\u2019t walk around with a manhole cover.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Rumsfeld, the case that granted inmates at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp the right to challenge their detentions.)\nHe did say he was impressed by \u201cthe careful, scrupulous and fastidious work by the Justice Department\u201d in obtaining secret surveillance warrants and that the FISA judges pushed back when they thought warrants were not well argued.\nBut when Congress approved changes to the FISA system in 2008, it expanded the court\u2019s role. Since then, the government has asked FISA judges to approve entire surveillance programs, not just individual warrants.\nAs Judge Robertson argued, that is not a judicial function.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

It would seem so,\u201d Mr. Simon wrote at the start of a 2,500-word post dismissing as \u201chyperbole\u201d much of the reaction to this week\u2019s revelations, by The Guardian and The Washington Post, of the National Security Agency\u2019s vast data collection efforts.\nHis argument hinged on the difference between collecting communications data and actually examining it, and he used his experience as a reporter to explain the distinction. \u201cHaving labored as a police reporter in the days before the Patriot Act, I can assure all there has always been a stage before the wiretap, a preliminary process involving the capture, retention and analysis of raw data,\u201d Mr. Simon wrote. \u201cIt has been so for decades now in this country. The only thing new here, from a legal standpoint, is the scale on which the F.B.I. and N.S.A. are apparently attempting to cull antiterrorism leads from that data. But the legal and moral principles? Same old stuff.\u201d\nThe argument is nuanced, and Mr. Simon does not deny that there is \u201cthe potential for authoritarian overreach,\u201d but he comes down fairly clearly on the side of those who called for the N.S.A. to harness modern information technology more aggressively than it did before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\nI know it\u2019s big and scary that the government wants a database of all phone calls. And it\u2019s scary that they\u2019re paying attention to the Internet. And it\u2019s scary that your cellphones have GPS installed. And it\u2019s scary, too, that the little box that lets you go through the short toll lane on I-95 lets someone, somewhere know that you are on the move. Privacy is in decline around the world, largely because technology and big data have matured to the point where it is easy to create a net that monitors many daily interactions. Sometimes the data is valuable for commerce \u2014 witness those Facebook ads for Italian shoes that my wife must endure \u2014 and sometimes for law enforcement and national security. But be honest, most of us are grudging participants in this dynamic. We want the cellphones. We like the Internet. We don\u2019t want to sit in the slow lane at the Harbor Tunnel toll plaza.\nThe question is not should the resulting data exist. It does. And it forever will, to a greater and greater extent. And therefore, the present-day question can\u2019t seriously be this: Should law enforcement in the legitimate pursuit of criminal activity pretend that such data does not exist. The question is more fundamental: Is government accessing the data for the legitimate public safety needs of the society, or are they accessing it in ways that abuse individual liberties and violate personal privacy \u2014 and in a manner that is unsupervised.\nNot all of Mr. Simon\u2019s fans welcomed his intervention in the debate, but the writer spent much of Friday afternoon and evening engaging with readers of the post, answering more than two dozen of the comments at length over the course of several hours.\nDavid Simon\u2019s defense of the NSA was even more unnecessary than The Wire Season 2.\nEven those who do not share Mr. Simon\u2019s perspective on the government\u2019s surveillance programs might find part of his post useful as an exploration of just how law enforcement officials might try to use or make sense of such a vast amount of information.\nThat same issue was addressed last year in a short film on the N.S.A. whistle-blower William Binney, which was made for the Opinion section of The New York Times\u2019s Web site by Laura Poitras, the documentary filmmaker who co-authored The Washington Post\u2019s article on the N.S.A.\u2019s Prism program this week.\nLast year, Ms. Poitras told Glenn Greenwald, the columnist and blogger whose reporting for The Guardian revealed the extent of the N.S.A.\u2019s work, that she had been targeted by the federal government. Ms. Poitras said that she was repeatedly singled out for questioning as she returned from trips abroad to film interviews for documentaries on the United States\u2019s military response to the Sept. 11 attacks.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

A number of lawmakers have demanded disclosure of the legal claims behind the National Security Agency\u2019s data-mining program, as well as more openness from the court that approves surveillance requests.\nSome of the objections come from fairly unsurprising quarters \u2014 like Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who told The Times in an interview that he planned to file legislation requiring more disclosure\nof the National Security Agency\u2019s data collection.\nIt\u2019s been more surprising to hear criticism from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, one of the authors of the Patriot Act. Mr. Sensenbrenner has said the law was never intended by Congress to include massive fishing expeditions.\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Sensenbrenner told James Cole, a deputy attorney general, that Congress might refuse to renew the part of the Patriot Act that supposedly authorizes data collection when it expires in 2015. \u201cUnless you realize you\u2019ve got a problem, that is not going to happen,\u201d he said.\nThere\u2019s no sign the administration realizes that. Also on Wednesday, Mr. Sensenbrenner released a letter from the Justice Department reiterating claims that the data collection program was legal \u2014 and the only way to identify suspected terrorist activity.\nLawmakers are also objecting to the secrecy under which the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court authorizes such programs. (It\u2019s ironic that the court was created 25 years ago to rein in government snooping.)\nFISA judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, without any Senate oversight or confirmation. But Rep. Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, who is on the House Intelligence Committee, has said he will introduce a bill to change that process. He thinks the President should nominate all 11 judges and that the Senate should confirm them. The bill would retain the current seven-year term for FISA judges.\nMeanwhile, big Internet companies like Apple, Google, Facebook and Twitter are urging the government to publish information on its data collection programs. Mr. Sensenbrenner and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder supporting that request.\nWhite House officials, no doubt, are hoping that this uproar will subside, as other waves of opposition to the steady erosion of civil liberties in the name of counter-terrorism have dissipated over the years. There is reason to worry that they are right, but there is hope in the sustained \u2014 even growing \u2014 nature of this particular backlash, and its bipartisan nature.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Snowden, the leaker who had worked as a National Security Agency contractor, announced the suspension of its service Thursday afternoon. In a blog post, the company\u2019s owner, Ladar Levison, suggested \u2014 though did not say explicitly \u2014 that he had received a secret search order, and was choosing to shut the service to avoid being \u201ccomplicit in crimes against the American people.\u201d\nWithin hours, a fast-growing Maryland-based start-up called Silent Circle also closed its e-mail service and destroyed its e-mail servers. The company said it saw the writing on the wall \u2014 while also making it plain that it had not yet received any court orders soliciting user data.\nMike Janke, the chief executive, said the company\u2019s customers included heads of state, members of royalty and government agencies. The company will continue its encrypted phone and text messaging service.\nIn effect, both businesses destroyed their assets \u2014 in part or in full \u2014 to avoid turning over their customers\u2019 data. Such public displays are far more difficult for large companies to make, and help explain why the most public efforts to challenge secret government orders have come from small companies and nonprofits.\n\u201cProviders are in a bind,\u201d observed Orin Kerr, a law professor who specializes in surveillance law at George Washington University. \u201cThey need to respect the privacy rights of customers in order to keep customers, but they also have an obligation to comply with the law. A small company can say, \u2018Rather than comply with the law, we will go under.\u2019 But Verizon is not going to do that.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe government usually has an easier time with large companies because they have more of a long-term need to have good relations with the government.\u201d\nLarge Internet companies have moved more quietly and cautiously, addressing consumers\u2019 concerns about government requests only after information about secret orders was leaked by Mr. Snowden. This week, technology industry executives and lobbyists attended meetings at the White House.\nIn an effort to address public concern about the government\u2019s surveillance programs, President Obama on Friday announced the creation of a task force to advise the government about how to balance security and privacy. He also said he supported a proposal to change the procedures of the secret court that approves electronic spying under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\nThe level of secrecy appeared to be a particular frustration for Mr. Levison. On the Lavabit site Thursday afternoon, Mr. Levison said he was legally prohibited from explaining why he had been compelled to suspend operations. \u201cI wish that I could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. I cannot,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cThis experience has taught me one very important lesson: without Congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would strongly recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the United States,\u201d he added.\nSilent Circle\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Janke, said executives at his company \u2014 the founders include Philip R. Zimmermann, who created the original e-mail encryption protocol known as Pretty Good Privacy \u2014 had opted to follow Lavabit\u2019s example, even before being served with a government order.\nHe said the incident was a reminder of a fundamental flaw with e-mail technology. An \u201caggressive\u201d government, he said, can extract e-mail data from any company, no matter how good the company\u2019s encryption tools. Keys to unlock its customers\u2019 encrypted communications had been stored on the company\u2019s servers. Silent Circle destroyed that data, the digital equivalent of a library setting fire to its membership records to keep the government from knowing who checked out what books.\nSilent Circle\u2019s text and phone service uses somewhat different technology. The encryption keys are generated between two users as they are communicating and then destroyed. It is aptly called ephemeral encryption.\nBruce Schneier, a cryptographer, applauded Lavabit\u2019s decision, pointing out that its self-destruction was made possible because it had no shareholders to answer to.\n\u201cCould you imagine what would happen if Mark Zuckerberg or Larry Page decided to shut down Facebook or Google rather than answer National Security Letters? They couldn\u2019t. They would be fired,\u201d Mr. Schneier wrote on his blog. \u201cWhen the small companies can no longer operate, it\u2019s another step in the consolidation of the surveillance society.\u201d\nBefore Lavabit, there was Calyx Internet Access, a small Internet service provider and Web hosting company, that challenged the constitutionality of a secret National Security Letter in 2004. Four Connecticut librarians likewise won their gag order challenge under a so-called National Security Letter in 2006. And a similar challenge was brought by a nonprofit digital library, called the Internet Archive; the government had sought information about one of its users, and it won its challenge to a gag order in 2008.\nThe most closely watched ruling on secret orders came this year. The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation appealed to a United States District judge to lift a gag order issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through a national security letter. The court said the gag order was unconstitutional.\nLarge companies have pushed back more quietly. Yahoo is the only company known to have challenged a gag order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And a coalition of companies, including Google and Microsoft, which sit on a trove of personal communications, have appealed to the Obama administration to be able to disclose just how many Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court orders they receive.\nAccording to Justice Department figures, in 2012, government authorities made 1,856 data requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the vast majority for electronic surveillance, and another 15,229 requests through National Security Letters.\nNicholas Merrill, the owner of Calyx, received one such letter in early 2004 under the Patriot Act. He closed his business within months. \u201cI was terrified they were going to drag me away,\u201d he said Friday.\nIt took him years to challenge the court order. He still cannot discuss its contents, he can only acknowledge its existence. His actions, he said, were possible only because his company was small and he was not beholden to shareholders. \u201cIn a way being a small company is quite liberating,\u201d he said.\nMr. Merrill said he immediately empathized with Mr. Levison\u2019s plight. \u201cI would imagine he feels so strongly about this that he\u2019s willing to sacrifice his own business and he\u2019s willing to risk angering all his client base for this basic principle,\u201d he said. \u201cI can totally relate to where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d\nNicole Perlroth contributed reporting.\nAn earlier version of this post misstated where silent Silent Circle is based. It is based in Maryland, not Washington. An earlier version also misstated the nature of a gag order at issue in the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s federal court appeal. The order was issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through a national security letter, not by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\nA headline on Saturday with an article about e-mail providers that challenge government surveillance misstated the actions taken by one company, Lavabit. While the company did shut down its service, it did not destroy its customer data.

The Chinese called the islands the Diaoyus; the Taiwanese call them the Tiaoyutai.\nBut the re-taking operation, planned for an uninhabited island off Okinawa called Irisunajima, has now been shelved, according to Japanese government sources cited by Kyodo, with \u201cthe hope of the prime minister\u2019s office and the U.S. side of not aggravating ties with China.\u201d\nManeuvers in the Keen Sword exercise are planned for various locations around Japan \u2014 the specific locations were not disclosed \u2014 but they were not expected to venture near the disputed islands.\nA Chinese military spokesman, Yang Yujun, said at a briefing, \u201cWe sternly oppose Japan wooing extraterritorial nations for joint military drills that only increase regional tensions.\u201d\nChinese maritime surveillance ships have been patrolling near the Senkaku/Diaoyu chain for more than two weeks now, as my colleague Martin Fackler recently reported from Japan.\n\u201cWhile Chinese ships have sailed near the islands before, this is the first time since a recent flare-up began that they have plied the waters so consistently,\u201d Martin wrote.\n\u201cAnalysts say that suggests China is trying to wear down Japan\u2019s resolve in the dispute, and possibly even trying to chip away at Japan\u2019s claim of having effective control over the uninhabited islands established in part by its own maritime patrols.\u201d\nShips from the Chinese, Taiwanese and Japanese navies have so far refrained from navigating close to the islands. As Martin reported:\nBy deploying paramilitary ships, analysts said, both nations were being careful not to call in their navies, in order to avoid a dangerous escalation. Still, Japanese Coast Guard ships and many of China\u2019s surveillance ships are armed, leading to concerns that a miscalculation or human error by a single sailor could touch off a violent confrontation.\nBeijing also continued to build diplomatic pressure over the island dispute. Liu Xiaoming, the ambassador to Britain, in a commentary in The Financial Times, said, \u201cThe friction has been caused solely by Japan. China has made clear its position and expressed concerns to Japan on many levels, but Japan is intransigent.\u201d\nMr. Liu reiterated the bitterness felt by China and other countries in the region over Japan\u2019s brutal conduct during World War II:\nMany historians have compared postwar Japan and Germany. Their conclusions are consistent: Unlike Germany, Japan has never seriously reflected on its behavior during the second world war. War criminals are still worshiped at the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. Senior Japanese officials often pay tribute there. Japan\u2019s leaders have occasionally offered grudging apologies but these have never convinced its neighbors.\nKeen Sword \u2014 especially with its size, scope and timing \u2014 might appear to be something of a provocation. But military officials and diplomats stress that it is a regularly scheduled operation, one of countless military drills that the United States holds with other Asia-Pacific nations, sometimes bilaterally, sometimes with a group of nations. Keen Sword was last held in 2010.\nIndeed, China and the United States plan to hold \u201ca joint drill on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief\u201d later this month in Sichuan Province, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported. Military medics will participate, the paper said, and Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus will make a visit.\nA 15-day exercise with Japan called Orient Shield, for example, is now under way, with troops from both countries operating in live-fire drills. It marks the first time that U.S. Army forces have used Stryker armored vehicles in Japan, which \u201cshows our increased commitment to a Pacific partner,\u201d said Lt. Col. Jonathan Larsen, quoted in a recent article by the newspaper Stars & Stripes.\nDispelling the \u201carrogant American stereotype\u201d is another goal of the exercise, according to Major Randall Baucom, a U.S. Army Japan spokesman.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t Rambo. We aren\u2019t \u2018Hurt Locker,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re soldiers just like they are, trying to protect our country and our buddies and ourselves.\u201d\nMeanwhile, thousands of people protested in Tokyo on Sunday over the U.S. military\u2019s deployment of Osprey hybrid aircraft in Japan. The Associated Press reported that the crowd chanted, \u201cOspreys out!

Before that, I was a member of the first group of students after restoration of the college entrance examination after the Cultural Revolution (1977); my career was s smooth ride from undergraduate to grad student through to Ph.D.\nAfter graduation I stayed on as a lecturer at Beijing Normal University. On the podium, I was a popular teacher, well received by students. I was at the same time a public intellectual. In the 1980s I published articles and books that created an impact, was frequently invited to speak in various places, and was invited to go abroad to Europe and the U.S. as a visiting scholar. What I required of myself was: both as a person and in my writing, I had to live with honesty, responsibility and dignity.\nSubsequently, because I had returned from the U.S. to take part in the 1989 movement, I was imprisoned for \u201ccounter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement to crime,\u201d losing the platform which was my passion; I was never again allowed publish or speak in public in China. Simply for expressing divergent political views and taking part in a peaceful and democratic movement, a teacher loses his podium, a writer loses the right to publish, and a public intellectual loses the chance to speak publicly, which is a sad thing, both for myself as an individual, and for China after three decades of reform and opening up.\nThinking about it, my most dramatic experiences after June Fourth have all linked with courts; the two opportunities I had to speak in public have been provided by trials held in the People\u2019s Intermediate Court in Beijing, one in January 1991 and one now. Although the charges on each occasion were different, they were in essence the same, both being crimes of expression.\nTwenty years on, the innocent souls of June Fourth do not yet rest in peace, and I, who had been drawn into the path of dissidence by the passions of June Fourth, after leaving the Qincheng Prison in 1991, lost in the right to speak openly in my own country, and could only do so through overseas media, and hence was monitored for many years; placed under surveillance (May 1995 \u2013 January 1996); educated through labor (October 1996 \u2013 October 1999), and now once again am thrust into the dock by enemies in the regime.\nBut I still want to tell the regime that deprives me of my freedom, I stand by the belief I expressed twenty years ago in my \u201cJune Second Hunger Strike Declaration\u201d \u2014 I have no enemies, and no hatred. None of the police who have monitored, arrested and interrogated me, the prosecutors who prosecuted me, or the judges who sentence me, are my enemies. While I\u2019m unable to accept your surveillance, arrest, prosecution or sentencing, I respect your professions and personalities, including Zhang Rongge and Pan Xueqing who act for the prosecution at present. I was aware of your respect and sincerity in your interrogation of me on December 3.\nFor hatred is corrosive of a person\u2019s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation\u2019s spirit, instigate brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society\u2019s tolerance and humanity, and block a nation\u2019s progress to freedom and democracy. I hope therefore to be able to transcend my personal vicissitudes in understanding the development of the state and changes in society, to counter the hostility of the regime with the best of intentions, and defuse hate with love.\nAs we all know, reform and opening up brought about development of the state and change in society. In my view, it began with abandoning \u201ctaking class struggle as the key link,\u201d which had been the ruling principle of the Mao era. We committed ourselves instead to economic development and social harmony. The process of abandoning the \u201cphilosophy of struggle\u201d was one of gradually diluting the mentality of enmity, eliminating the psychology of hatred, and pressing out the \u201cwolf\u2019s milk\u201d in which our humanity had been steeped. It was this process that provided a relaxed environment for the reform and opening up at home and abroad, for the restoration of mutual love between people, and soft humane soil for the peaceful coexistence of different values and different interests, and thus provided the explosion of popular creativity and the rehabilitation of warmheartedness with incentives consistent with human nature.\nExternally abandoning \u201canti-imperialism and anti-revisionism,\u201d and internally, abandoning \u201cclass struggle\u201d may be called the basic premise of the continuance of China\u2019s reform and opening up to this day. The market orientation of the economy; the cultural trend toward diversity; and the gradual change of order to the rule of law, all benefited from the dilution of this mentality of enmity. Even in the political field, where progress is slowest, dilution of the mentality of enmity also made political power ever more tolerant of diversity in society, the intensity persecution of dissidents has declined substantially, and characterization of the 1989 movement has changed from an \u201cinstigated rebellion\u201d to a \u201cpolitical upheaval.\u201d\nThe dilution of the mentality of enmity made the political power gradually accept the universality of human rights. In 1998, the Chinese government promised the world it would sign the the two international human rights conventions of the U.N., marking China\u2019s recognition of universal human rights standards; in 2004, the National People\u2019s Congress for the first time inscribed into the constitution that \u201cthe state respects and safeguards human rights,\u201d signaling that human rights had become one of the fundamental principles of the rule of law. In the meantime, the present regime also proposed \u201cputting people first\u201d and \u201ccreating a harmonious society,\u201d which signaled progress in the Party\u2019s concept of rule.\nThis macro-level progress was discernible as well in my own experiences since being arrested.\nWhile I insist on my innocence, and that the accusations against me are unconstitutional, in the year and more since I lost my freedom, I\u2019ve experienced two places of detention, four pretrial police officers, three prosecutors and two judges. In their handling of the case, there has been no lack of respect, no time overruns and no forced confessions. Their calm and rational attitude has over and again demonstrated goodwill. I was transferred on June 23 from the residential surveillance to Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Detention Center No. 1, known as \u201cBeikan.\u201d I saw progress in surveillance in the six months I spent there.\nI spent time in the old Beikan (Banbuqiao) in 1996, and compared with the Beikan of a decade ago, there has been great improvement in the hardware of facilities and software of management.\nIn particular, Beikan\u2019s innovative humane management based on respecting the rights and dignity of detainees, implementing more flexible management of the will be flexible to the detainees words and deeds, embodied in the Warm broadcast and Repentance, the music played before meals, and when waking up and going to sleep, gave detainees feelings of dignity and warmth, stimulating their consciousness of keeping order in their cells and opposing the warders sense of themselves as lords of the jail, detainees, providing not only a humanized living environment, but greatly improved the detainees\u2019 environment and mindset for litigation, I had close contact with Liu Zhen, in charge of my cell. People feel warmed by his respect and care for detainees, reflected in the management of every detail, and permeating his every word and deed. Getting to know the sincere, honest, responsible, goodhearted Liu Zhen really was a piece of good luck for me in Beikan.\nPolitical beliefs are based on such convictions and personal experiences; I firmly believe that China\u2019s political progress will never stop, and I\u2019m full of optimistic expectations of freedom coming to China in the future, because no force can block the human desire for freedom. China will eventually become a country of the rule of law in which human rights are supreme. I\u2019m also looking forward to such progress being reflected in the trial of this case, and look forward to the full court\u2019s just verdict \u2014 one that can stand the test of history.\nAsk me what has been my most fortunate experience of the past two decades, and I\u2019d say it was gaining the selfless love of my wife, Liu Xia. She cannot be present in the courtroom today, but I still want to tell you, sweetheart, that I\u2019m confident that your love for me will be as always. Over the years, in my non-free life, our love has contained bitterness imposed by the external environment, but is boundless in afterthought. I am sentenced to a visible prison while you are waiting in an invisible one. Your love is sunlight that transcends prison walls and bars, stroking every inch of my skin, warming my every cell, letting me maintain my inner calm, magnanimous and bright, so that every minute in prison is full of meaning. But my love for you is full of guilt and regret, sometimes heavy enough hobble my steps. I am a hard stone in the wilderness, putting up with the pummeling of raging storms, and too cold for anyone to dare touch. But my love is hard, sharp, and can penetrate any obstacles. Even if I am crushed into powder, I will embrace you with the ashes.\nGiven your love, sweetheart, I would face my forthcoming trial calmly, with no regrets about my choice and looking forward to tomorrow optimistically. I look forward to my country being a land of free expression, where all citizens\u2019 speeches are treated the same; here, different values, ideas, beliefs, political views\u2026 both compete with each other and coexist peacefully; here, majority and minority opinions will be given equal guarantees, in particular, political views different from those in power will be fully respected and protected; here, all political views will be spread in the sunlight for the people to choose; all citizens will be able to express their political views without fear, and will never be politically persecuted for voicing dissent; I hope to be the last victim of China\u2019s endless literary inquisition, and that after this no one else will ever be jailed for their speech.\nFreedom of expression is the basis of human rights, the source of humanity and the mother of truth. To block freedom of speech is to trample on human rights, to strangle humanity and to suppress the truth.\nI do not feel guilty for following my constitutional right to freedom of expression, for fulfilling my social responsibility as a Chinese citizen. Even if accused of it, I would have no complaints. Thank you!\nAfter Ms. Ullman delivered a slightly different English translation of Mr. Liu\u2019s statement, Mark MacKinnon, East Asia correspondent for Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, commented on Twitter:\nAn obvious thing to say, but Mr. Liu is one hell of a writer.\nOne complaint: another Chinese dissident should have read Liu\u2019s speech. Many are detained, but some are in the room listening.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The lyrics are earnest and powerful, even in their simplicity; the melodies are hypnotically catchy; and the sound, developed in collaboration with the producer Andy LeMaster, feels very now. On the eve of a big European tour promoting the album, New Idea Society\u2019s frontman Mike Law talks about the innovative new 3-D video for the single \u201cThorns.\u201d\nO.K., before we get to the video, what\u2019s this song about? What inspired it?\nI received an e-mail from someone in Iran during the Green movement unrest there; he was listening to a song from my old band to help him get through. Obviously it moved me greatly to hear that as I had already been amazed by the bravery the people there had shown. Some of that sentiment and emotion found its way into the songwriting \u2014 it is the most hopeful song on the album. It contains the lyric \u201cNothing here ever goes away\u201d on an album called \u201cSomehow Disappearing.\u201d For me it is impossible to feel sadness without hope, so it was a necessary song for the album.\nWow, so was this someone in Iran you knew already or a random fan? How did they find your music?\nI never actually figured that out. I know we didn\u2019t know each other before. I resisted the urge to ask him a lot of questions. I might have been overly cautious, but I didn\u2019t really even know what kind of information I should ask because I knew that Internet surveillance was at a high. But the network of underground music is remarkable; people from countries you would least expect will write you out of nowhere. This was pretty special, though.\nFor this video, can you explain the technique?\nThe director, Josh Gross, used two DSLR cameras: a stereomicroscope and a printer. Each frame was printed out onto paper and then reshot through the stereomicroscope. We used some different types of paper for different effects.\nSo how many frames did you have to print?\nThousands. The printing creates some of the charm and movement of the video. I think seeing the fibers of the paper is really important. I like that we become blurred characters. At its core this is animation.\nNot that there is much similarity, but when you hear \u201c3-D\u201d these days, you think \u201cAvatar.\u201d Do you see irony in an indie band taking their video in that direction?\nNot really. I saw this as a chance for us to make something exactly as we wanted. I had saved the money up so we could be self-funded and beholden to no one. That\u2019s really important to us. That is why we chose to work with Andy LeMaster when we produced the album. He was on the same page as us. I am sure it surprised some people that we worked with a producer like Andy who records Bright Eyes and even some R.E.M. stuff \u2014 hardly indie. Maybe there\u2019s some irony there?", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Andrews, a New Jersey Democrat who supported an extension of the Patriot Act in 2005, said on Wednesday that politics had nothing to do with his vote. Rather, he said, Republicans made a mistake in rushing the bill to the floor without hearings or amendments. The vote was taken under a suspension of the rules, which required a two-thirds margin for passage.\n\u201cIn 2005 I think there was a degree of care and deliberation; I don\u2019t think there was this time,\u201d he said \u201cI don\u2019t think there was this time.\u201d\nMr. Andrews is in favor of extending two of the counterterrorism act\u2019s provisions, but has reservations about the so-called \u201clone wolf\u201d provision, which allows surveillance of someone who is deemed suspicious but who has no known ties to an organized terrorist group.\nIn the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would have allowed that provision to expire, while tightening oversight restrictions. That bill never made it to the floor.\n\u201cMost members had not thought much about this before yesterday afternoon,\u201d Mr. Andrews said, adding that he talked to Representative John Conyers, the former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, on the House floor just before Tuesday\u2019s vote. \u201cMr. Conyers persuaded a lot of people that this had been a rushed process here.\u201d\nIn addition to those Democrats, 26 Republicans voted against the bill, which would have extended for nine months the government\u2019s ability to conduct roving wiretaps of terror suspects, as well as the \u201clone wolf\u201d provision and a provision easing access to business records. Without an extension all three will expire on Feb. 28.\nDemocrats have said the defeat is a sign that Republican leaders cannot handle the competing pressures of governing and have already lost control of their caucus. The tally, 277 to 148, fell short of the two-thirds majority needed by 13 votes.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t do the basic job of Congressional leadership, which is count votes,\u201d Mr. Andrews said.\nMr. Boehner said Republicans were determined to push the extension through and Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Tuesday that he hoped to bring up the legislation again soon under rules allowing passage by a simple majority.\nAsked on Wednesday why the initial vote was scheduled so quickly, by the fast track method that avoids the amendment and rule-making process, Mr. Boehner responded simply: \u201cIt was.\u201d\nBesides Mr. Andrews and Mr. Conyers, the Democrats who changed their positions were Robert Brady of Pennsylvania; Corrine Brown of Florida; Andr\u00e9 Carson of Indiana; William L.

Witness, and Then a Suicide", "normalized_article_title": "a trader, an f.b.i. witness, and then a suicide", "text_content": "In a Manhattan courtroom last week, federal prosecutors played for a jury a secretly recorded telephone conversation between two Wall Street traders exchanging stock tips.\nTwo days later, one of those traders, Ephraim G. Karpel, hanged himself in his Fifth Avenue office, according to a law enforcement official.\nMr. Karpel was never charged with any wrongdoing, and until last week his name had not emerged in connection with the government\u2019s vast investigation of insider trading.\nYet while working for a New York commodities firm, he had agreed in 2008 to cooperate with federal authorities, and for about a year he taped conversations with fellow traders, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s investigation changed his life forever and was his unraveling,\u201d Fran Karpel, his wife, said in a telephone interview from her home in Livingston, N.J. \u201cHe sank deeper and deeper into a hole and couldn\u2019t see a way out.\u201d\nFederal prosecutors\u2019 increasingly aggressive and public stance in pursuing insider trading has led to headline-grabbing convictions and stepped-up compliance procedures at hedge funds.\nBut behind the scenes, the government\u2019s hardball investigative tactics \u2014 using surveillance, pressuring witnesses and raiding offices \u2014 have also spawned a culture of fear on Wall Street and affected the lives of many who have not been accused of any crimes.\nWhether the investigation played a role in Mr. Karpel\u2019s death cannot be known. He had been depressed after losing his job, his wife said, and other factors may have contributed.\nBut according to Ms. Karpel, his death at age 50 came three years after a pair of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation approached him outside the Applejack Diner, at 55th Street and Broadway. The agents took him inside the restaurant and, seated at a table toward the back, told him they had evidence of his involvement in an insider trading network.\nThe government\u2019s supposed evidence included a telephone conversation between Mr. Karpel and Zvi Goffer, a trader whose phone the F.B.I. had tapped.\nOn the call, recorded on Dec. 31, 2007, Mr. Karpel told Mr. Goffer that the drugstore chain Walgreens had made an offer to acquire Matria Healthcare.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the trade for the month of January for you,\u201d Mr. Karpel said, according to a transcript of the call. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from a banker.\u201d\nThat call was one of more than 20 wiretapped conversations played during Mr. Goffer\u2019s two-month trial, which is now in jury deliberations.\nThe Walgreens deal never happened, but the recorded conversation led federal authorities to approach Mr. Karpel and seek his help in building insider trading cases. It is unclear how investigators thought that Mr. Karpel could help them.\n\u201cEphraim was a very popular guy and knew a lot of people,\u201d his wife said. \u201cHe always called it a fishing expedition.\u201d\nIndeed, Mr. Karpel had many Wall Street connections. He worked for 18 years at Mutual Shares, an investment firm run by the fund manager Michael F. Price, rising to the position of head trader. Mr. Karpel then left Mutual Shares to work as an analyst, a job he considered more cerebral and respectable.\nHe developed an expertise in metals and mining stocks. After a stint at P. Schoenfeld Asset Management, Mr. Karpel joined Tigris Financial Group, a commodities firm run by the investor Thomas S. Kaplan.\nNone of Mr. Karpel\u2019s former employers has been accused of any wrongdoing.\nOver the last two years, the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which has led the federal investigative effort in this area, has charged 49 people with insider trading crimes. Thirty-nine of them have pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury, including Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire hedge fund manager.\nBut the federal authorities\u2019 techniques have rarely been seen on Wall Street before.\nLate last year, F.B.I. agents conducted three simultaneous raids of large hedge funds. Two of those funds have since closed. And for the first time in an insider trading inquiry, the government has been using wiretaps \u2014 a method typically reserved for drug crimes and organized crime cases \u2014 to record the telephone conversations of Wall Street traders.\nIn one instance, the government came under official criticism for its wiretap practices. Earlier this year, Judge Richard J. Sullivan rebuked law enforcement officials for monitoring an intimate call between a trader and his wife, a conversation that was not germane to the trader\u2019s case.\n\u201cThe court is deeply troubled by this unnecessary, and apparently voyeuristic, intrusion,\u201d wrote Judge Sullivan, a federal judge in Manhattan.\nIt was wiretaps that led the F.B.I. to confront Mr. Karpel on the street.\nAfter the encounter, Mr. Karpel retained Daniel R. Alonso, then a partner at the law firm Kaye Scholer, who advised Mr. Karpel to cooperate with the government.\nMr. Alonso, now the chief assistant district attorney for Manhattan, would neither confirm nor deny that he had represented Mr. Karpel, citing legal ethics rules. Representatives of the F.B.I. and the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment.\nMs. Karpel said Mr. Alonso had counseled her and her husband to keep Mr. Karpel\u2019s cooperation with the government quiet.\n\u201cOur lawyer said, \u2018You can only discuss this with me, your rabbi or your therapist,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Karpel said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have therapists and we belonged to a synagogue but didn\u2019t want to talk to our rabbi, so we kept it a secret from everyone, even our family.\u201d\n\u201cWe were terrified,\u201d Ms. Karpel added. \u201cWe had nobody to turn to.\u201d\nMs. Karpel said her husband had been horribly conflicted about his cooperation. She said he had been so worried about entrapping his friends that he began cutting himself off from Wall Street contacts.\nBy mid-2009, the F.B.I. began to lose interest in Mr. Karpel, according to his wife, and stopped asking for his help.\nAround that time, however, his employer, Tigris, learned of his involvement in the investigation, according to a firm spokesman. Tigris dismissed him, but he continued to work with the company as an outside consultant until his death.\nIn recent months, Mr. Karpel had been in talks to join Javelin Partners, a fledgling Toronto firm that advises small mining companies. He never joined the firm but had been subleasing space at Javelin\u2019s New York office on lower Fifth Avenue, which is where he was found.\nAfter he lost his job at Tigris he became very depressed, Ms. Karpel said.\n\u201cHe loved Wall Street and he loved his friends there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe felt like he had to reinvent himself.\u201d\nTranscript of the Wiretapped Call Between Ephraim Karpel and Zvi Goffer", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

None of his belongings were taken.\nMr. DeGraw told investigators the men had attacked him after he left the club, which he owns with his brother, Joey DeGraw, who is also a musician. He told the police he had spent the night drinking with friends, the official said.\nMr. DeGraw did not call the police immediately after the attack, the official said. Instead he walked across the East Village, heading up First Avenue to 19th Street, where a southbound taxi knocked him over as he stood in the middle of the avenue, his shirt ripped and his face bloodied. Although he did not sustain serious injuries from his encounter with the taxi, a passerby saw the accident and called an ambulance and the medics took him to the hospital.\nInvestigators do not know precisely where the attack occurred, and they were seeking a second interview with Mr. DeGraw to get a clearer account, the official said.\nDetectives have tried to reconstruct Mr. DeGraw\u2019s movements with footage from surveillance cameras, the official said. One video captured Mr. DeGraw at 3:26 a.m. on Monday as he walked alone from the bar near Allen and Houston Streets. He wore a ripped shirt but did not appear to be bleeding. At 3:48 a.m. a second camera filmed him as he walked on First Avenue, between Third and Fourth Streets. Then at 4:01 a.m. he appeared to be bloodied and injured when a camera filmed him walking on the west side of First Avenue, near Seventh Street.\nMr. DeGraw became a pop-rock star in 2003, when his debut album Chariot (J Records) yielded several hit singles, among them \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Be,\u201d which reached the No. 1 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart and later became the theme song for the television show \u201cOne Tree Hill.\u201d His new album, \u201cSweeter,\u201d is due out on Sept. 20.\nStill hospitalized on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. DeGraw canceled a concert at the performing arts center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., but he had not yet called off a performance at Jones Beach on Friday.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

A line of police officers appeared, running in formation, seconds before the protesters blocked the car.\nThe video clip also showed the protesters, who had apparently peeled off from a larger anti-Japanese rally, chanting and throwing objects at the car, before police officers cleared a path for the vehicle to drive off.\nWriting on Twitter, Mr. Ai reported that dozens of protesters had arrived at the embassy at about 4 p.m. chanting, \u201cPay us back our money!\u201d and \u201cDown with U.S. imperialism,\u201d perhaps in reference to American support for Japan.\n\u4e0b\u5348\u56db\u70b9\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u6e38\u884c\u8005\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u4f7f\u9986\u524d\u9ad8\u558a\u201c\u6253\u5012\u7f8e\u5e1d\u201d\u201c\u8fd8\u94b1\u201d\u53e3\u53f7\uff0c\u62e6\u622a\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u4e86\u4e00\u8f86\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f7f\u9986\u8f7f\u8f66\u3002 RT @Patrick_TRN: RT @aiww: \u8d34\u4e00\u5f20\u7167\u7247 //t.co/bEIdINQL\nThe artist also posted a series of photographs on Twitter, via Instagram, which appear to have been shot just after the video, from above and at street level, showing more and more security gathered around the embassy gate.\nMr. Ai, via Twitter, confirmed to The Lede that he shot the video and photographs of the incident and shared them on the social networks. Earlier this week, another clip posted on YouTube by a video blogger in Beijing showed the artist shooting images of a protest on Sunday outside the Japanese embassy on his iPhone.\nIn April, our colleague Edward Wong reported, Mr. Ai said that he was ordered to shut down a Web site, weiweicam.com, which streamed live video of the artist from webcams in his home and studio in Beijing. That project was apparently a critique of the government\u2019s decision to put him under constant surveillance after releasing him from 81 days in secret detention.\nAs the American filmmaker Alison Klayman explained in a PBS Frontline video report on Mr. Ai broadcast last year, he has experimented with citizen journalism in the past. After an earthquake devastated Sichuan Province in 2008, the artist gave video cameras to readers of his blog in the region, to begin what he called a citizens\u2019 investigation into the earthquake deaths.\nWatch Who\u2019s Afraid of Ai Weiwei? on PBS.

That\u2019s particularly good thing, Christine Haughney writes, for the 36-year-old left-leaning magazine, which has a circulation of just over 200,000 and a business model that is partly dependent on its readers\u2019 contributions. One reader visited the magazine\u2019s Washington bureau and dropped off a check.\n- In trying to move the debate beyond Mr. Romney\u2019s comments, the Republican National Committee on Wednesday released a videotape from 1998 of Barack Obama, an Illinois State Senator at the time, discussing \u201credistribution\u201d of income, getting big promotion at the Drudge Report Web site. Yet the timing for this discussion is odd, writes Richard A. Oppel Jr. on The Caucus blog, because data \u201cdemonstrates that the nation has seen a significant redistribution of incomes over the past generation \u2013 from the poor and middle class to the rich, and especially to the very rich \u2013 all while government policies have also become less redistributive over the same period.\u201d\n- Despite out-raising the Obama campaign over the summer, the Romney campaign hasn\u2019t been able to dominate in TV advertising, particularly now when it needs a push, Jeremy W. Peters and Nicholas Confessore reported. They explain that much of the more than $300 million the campaign reported raising this summer wasn\u2019t directly for the campaign: that total included donations to the Republican National Committee, state Republican organizations and Congressional races.\nBritish regulators on Thursday concluded that the satellite-TV provider BSkyB was \u201cfit and proper\u201d to hold a broadcast license, an important endorsement for its biggest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation, Ravi Somaiya and Alan Cowell reported. The report from the Office of Communications, known as Ofcom, appeared to exonerate Mr. Murdoch in the hacking scandal that has engulfed News Corporation\u2019s British newspaper unit in concluding that BSkyB could retain its license to broadcast. The report did, however, raise questions about the competence of his son, James, who stepped down as nonexecutive chairman of BSkyB in April.\nFox is close to completing a deal with Major League Baseball that would add more playoff and regular-season games, in part to add content to Fox Sports One, a retooled version of its Speed channel, Richard Sandomir reported. By contrast, another cable broadcaster, TBS, will carry fewer games. Fox, which is hoping to build up a rival to ESPN, is expected to pay substantially more than $257 million a year it pays under its current contract, which ends after next season.\nThe dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei was producing journalism this week from Beijing, The Lede blog reported, posting video to YouTube and photographs to Instagram of a protest at the United States Embassy that included pelting the ambassador\u2019s car with objects. The protesters appeared to have spilled off from larger protests about the dispute between China and Japan over the control several tiny islands. In April, Mr. Ai was stopped from operating a webcam to stream video from his home and studio, apparently a commentary on the government\u2019s decision to put him under surveillance after releasing him from 81 days in detention.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Still, some said they were relieved that the state \u2014 and not outside experts, as environmental groups had wanted \u2014 will assess the potential for public harm.\nDan Fitzsimmons, president of the Joint Landowners Coalition of New York, which represents around pro-fracking 77,000 property owners, said that delegating the study to others would surely have resulted in longer delays. He therefore called the move \u201cgood news.\u201d\nAll the same, he said that further health studies were unnecessary. \u201cAs people who would host this activity on our land, we have investigated the practices and participated for years in recommending safeguards\nthat will allow us to utilize our resources and protect our land, air and water,\u201d Mr. Fitzsimmons said.\nStill, the sharpened focus on health heartened many of the dozens of state legislators, medical professionals and environmental groups who had warned that the state\u2019s environmental assessment of fracking gave short thrift to medical problems that could result from drilling-related ills like accidental water contamination and increased truck traffic.\nAnd Joseph Martens, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, did say that the state\u2019s health commissioner, Nirav Shah, who will be in charge of the review, could seek advice from \u201cthe most qualified outside experts,\u201d some noted.\nThe environmental group Riverkeeper welcomed the news. \u201cWe are confident that Commissioner Shah\u2019s review, if done comprehensively, objectively and with the help of truly qualified outside experts, will reveal significant omissions in D.E.C.\u2019s analysis and show why fracking cannot be allowed to move forward in New York,\u201d the group said in a statement.\nYet other environmentalists, noting that state officials had ignored calls for a separate health impact assessment for more than a year, continued to demand an independent study.\nNew Yorkers Against Fracking, a coalition of individuals and groups that want an outright ban on the controversial drilling process, said in a statement that \u201cnothing has roused the Department of Health from its unconcerned slumber\u201d when it relates to fracking. \u201cAnd we are now to believe that this agency will do any more heavy lifting than rubberstamp the findings of the D.E.C.?\u201d it said.\n\u201cWith the health of millions of New Yorkers at risk, Governor Cuomo must demand a rigorous, comprehensive health impact assessment by an independent team of public health experts,\u201d the group said. \u201cThat\u2019s what New York\u2019s universities and medical institutions are there to provide.\u201d\nThe state plans to set up a surveillance system to monitor health impacts if fracking does get under way.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In her column today, Sylvie Kauffman of the French newspaper Le Monde, one of our new Op-Ed contributors, recalled this quote from President Obama: \u201cWith respect to the Internet and e-mails, this does not apply to U.S. citizens and it does not apply to people living in the United States.\u201d\nBut each new disclosure, most based on the trove of documents leaked by Edward Snowden, makes assurances like that increasingly hollow.\nBart Gellman and Ashkan Soltani wrote today in The Washington Post about a previously undisclosed program in which the National Security Agency\u2019s Special Source Operations Branch (a wonderfully le Carr\u00e9-ish name) is sweeping up hundreds of millions\nof contact lists from e-mail and instant messaging accounts around the world each year.\nThe article said that the \u201ccollection takes place overseas\u201d \u2014 the usual flimsy excuse the spy agencies use for conducting surveillance on pretty much anyone they choose \u2014 but \u201ctwo senior U.S. intelligence officials acknowledged that it sweeps in the contacts of many Americans.\u201d\nOn a single day in 2012, The Post said, the N.S.A. \u201ccollected 444,743 email address books from Yahoo, 105,068 from Hotmail, 82,857 from Facebook, 33, 697 from Gmail and 22,811 from other providers.\u201d In other words, if you email or chat with someone outside the United States, the chances are pretty good that your contact list has been swept up in the dragnet.\nSpokesmen for the eavesdropping organizations reassured The Post that we shouldn\u2019t bother our heads with all of this. They have \u201cchecks and balances built into our tools,\u201d said one intelligence official.\nSince the Snowden leaks began, the administration has adopted an interesting definition of that term. It used to be that \u201cchecks and balances\u201d referred to one branch of the government checking and balancing the other branches \u2013 like the Supreme Court deciding whether laws are constitutional.\nNow the N.S.A., the C.I.A. and the White House use the term to refer to a secret organization reviewing the actions it has taken and deciding in secret by itself whether they were legal and constitutional.\nThe Post quoted an official who said that analysts \u201cmay not search within the contacts database or distribute information from it unless they can \u2018make the case that something in there is a valid foreign intelligence target in and of itself.\u2019\u201d But the article pointed out that the N.S.A. mostly has to make that case only to itself or other parts of the executive branch. Sometimes, it goes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \u2014 in secret, at hearings with no opposing argument.\nSo assurances that Americans need not worry about their contact lists being sucked up into the N.S.A. computers because officials would never think of abusing that vast database to violate our rights are about as believable as James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, telling a Senate committee last March that the intelligence agencies were \u201cnot wittingly\u201d collecting vast amounts of data on Americans\u2019 phone calls and Internet communications.\nMr. Clapper said later that it was the \u201cleast untruthful thing\u201d he could have said, but formally apologized to the Senate because his statement was just flatly false.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

That, they say, violates President Obama\u2019s pledge that if you like the insurance you have, you can keep it.\nThe next sentence \u2014 \u201cMr. Obama clearly misspoke when he said that.\u201d \u2014 clearly has many people fired up.\nA reader, Richard Limmer, was one of many who wrote to me about it. In an email he asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think a reasonable person would call that lying? Even the word \u2018misspoke\u2019 is Orwellian \u2018doublespeak\u2019 and part of the \u2018newspeak\u2019 your editors resort to when trying to rationalize Obama\u2019s blatant lies.\u201d\nAnother reader, Dean Landsman, saw this as a syntax problem: \u201cThere\u2019s a word flow and syntax problem here, or so it seems to me. How can one \u2018clearly misspeak?\u2019 Perhaps it would better flow, or would have been better stated, as, \u2018Clearly Mr. Obama misspoke when he said that.\u2019\u201d\nAnd a number of media outlets took the opportunity to bash The Times. The Fox News host Greta Van Susteren swung away on her blog: \u201cThe President said this not once, not twice, but multiple times and it was part of the Obamacare supporter talking points. You say it one time and it could be misspeaking \u2014 but when it is part of your mantra, and your talking points \u2026 repeated over and over and over again \u2026 well, the rest of us just are not that stupid.\u201d\nOn Monday, I asked the editorial page editor, Andrew Rosenthal, about the wording.\n\u201cWe have a high threshold for whether someone lied,\u201d he told me. The phrase that The Times used \u201cmeans that he said something that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d Saying the president lied would have meant something different, Mr. Rosenthal said \u2014 that he knew it was false and intended to express the falsehood. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said.\nContrary to what many readers and commenters are saying, The Times has frequently been tough on the president and his administration in recent months on subjects from press rights to surveillance to drones.\nBut \u201cmisspoke\u201d does suggest a one-time slip of the tongue.\nWouldn\u2019t it have been better, I asked Mr. Rosenthal, if the editorial had said that Mr. Obama\u2019s statements \u201cclearly weren\u2019t true,\u201d or that the president \u201cwas clearly wrong\u201d when he repeatedly made those statements?\nHe responded that the editorial\u2019s language was fine, but he also allowed, \u201cWe could have done that.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

LaRose (\u201cJihad Jane\u201d) and David Headley suggest that radicalization in the U.S. is increasing. Another American, Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, was detained and released last week in connection to a terrorism case in Ireland.\nOn Thursday, Ms. LaRose pleaded not guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to kill a Swedish cartoonist, who had drawn the prophet Muhammad with a dog\u2019s body. Mr. Headley, a Chicago businessman, pleaded guilty on Thursday to helping to provide surveillance for the Mumbai attacks in 2008.\nHow significant is the radicalization threat? What are the factors driving this trend?\n- Barak Mendelsohn, political science professor\n- Lydia Khalil, counterterrorism analyst\n- Rick Nelson and Ben Bodurian, C.S.I.S.\n- Peter Chalk, RAND Corp.\nThe Psychological Dimension\nBarak Mendelsohn is an assistant professor at Haverford College and a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. He is the author of \u201cCombating Jihadism: American Hegemony and Interstate Cooperation in the War on Terrorism.\u201d\nThe growing number of stories about Americans involved in terrorist plots is indeed alarming. The belief that the successful integration of Muslims into American society will prevent the rise of homegrown terrorism turned out to be false.\nAs troubling as some attacks are, they do not have inherent strategic value.\nSurprisingly, it comes at a time when the U.S. appears to be on its way out of Iraq, and the U.S. president is still considerably popular among the people of the Middle East. The incongruity between the common claims about the causes of radicalization and reality requires a more circumspect view of this phenomenon.\nWe should acknowledge that radicalization may stem from numerous disparate factors. Many times its reasons are idiosyncratic and reflect psychological factors at least as much (and probably more) as political or ideological ones.\nDespite the natural apprehension, we must not interpret a statistically insignificant number of cases as evidence for the magnitude of the problem of radicalization among Muslim Americans. Such a generalization will cause injustice to a large group of people and might also adversely affect the goal of reducing the alienation of Muslim youth.\nWe need a calibrated approach that takes the social and economic needs of the community into account and work with the community leaders. And we need to be realistic about the overall enterprise: the same way we will never be able to address all the factors that drive some young people to crime we will never be able to address the diverse factors that lead particular individuals to terrorism.\nUnfortunately, we must also accept that eventually some will succeed in carrying out attacks. Such attacks will not be on the level of 9/11 but more on the scale of the London bombing.\nEven more likely are attacks by lone gunners like Nidal Hassan. Troubling as such events are, they do not have inherent strategic value. Fortunately, while the Internet provides important information for would-be terrorists, it is not a sufficient substitution for formal training, thus limiting considerably the kind of attacks homegrown terrorists can carry out.\nThose who do seek training abroad are often identified through effective intelligence work. In fact, if there is one silver lining in the wave of threats, it is that the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. are getting better at their jobs and are able to expose threats relatively early on. This is not a substitution for a more comprehensive anti-radicalization effort, but it is a considerable achievement.\nThe Same Path\nLydia Khalil is an International Affairs Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former counterterrorism analyst for the New York Police Department.\nWhite, female, middle-aged and living in Pennsylvania doesn\u2019t fit your typical terrorist profile. Yet this describes Colleen LaRose or \u201cJihad Jane.\u201d Her background dispels the notion once and for all that you can profile a terrorist. But even though her story may be atypical, her path is anything but.\nThese extremists all stumbled upon a radical ideology that provided them with easy answers.\nMs. LaRose\u2019s case is one in a string of cases of homegrown Islamic extremists, including Najibullah Zazi who was arrested for conspiring to attack in New York City, Tarek Mehanna, a Boston resident who tried to connect with terrorist networks in Syria and Iraq and planned to attack a shopping mall, as well as David Headley, who is connected to the Mumbai attacks.\nEach of their backgrounds are unique, but their path to radicalization follows a surprising uniformity. They all followed a well-worn path to radicalization that starts with a transformative event or \u201cawakening\u201d moment that made them question their lives and the way they live it.\nThey sought something more, something true and they stumbled upon a radical ideology that provided them with easy answers. The 2007 New York Police Department report on radicalization calls this the \u201cindoctrination phase\u201d where the individuals intensify their beliefs and conclude that \u201cthe conditions and circumstance exist where action is required to support and further their cause.\u201d From there, it can be a short step to violent action.\nBefore the Internet, only those living in hotbeds of radicalization in Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Pakistan had access to these ideas. Now, anyone can point and click their way to a radical Web site.\nThis is not to say that anyone who views a jihadi video will magically become radicalized. But it is the case that, if you are open to the message, it is there in abundance. Jihadi chatrooms and blogs provide echo chambers and build a self-reinforcing community of the likeminded.\nThe case of Jihad Jane reveals that violent Islamic extremism is not about religion or ethnicity, but rather it is an ideology that can affect anyone with access to the Internet and a mindset susceptible to that argument.\nThey Don\u2019t Do It Alone\nRick \u201cOzzie\u201d Nelson is director of the Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. Ben Bodurian is a research assistant at the Center. They are co-authors of a new report, \u201cA Growing Terrorist Threat? Assessing \u201cHomegrown\u201d Extremism in the United States.\u201d\nWhat is behind the increased involvement of U.S. legal residents and citizens in global terrorist activities in the last year?\nMost suspects were involved with a transnational \u201cintermediary,\u201d like an extremist cleric or recruiter, who guided their radicalization.\nUnlike terrorism cases in Europe \u2014 where poverty, geographical segregation, and social marginalization tend to drive radicalization \u2014 the cases in the United States lack simple explanations. For instance, five young men from Northern Virginia, whom Pakistani authorities charged Wednesday with plotting attacks in Afghanistan, lived in middle class, well-integrated neighborhoods in the Washington, D.C. suburbs.\nStill, there are commonalities among the recent cases that suggest some directives for U.S. policy on homegrown extremism. First, most of the suspects were involved with some sort of transnational \u201cintermediary,\u201d like an extremist cleric or recruiter, who guided their radicalization. Second, most drew on an al-Qaeda-promulgated narrative \u2014 that the United States and West are at war with Islam \u2014 as justification for action.\nWe have to sever the links between intermediaries and their recruits. Partnerships between federal and local law enforcement agencies \u2014 like Joint Terrorism Task Forces \u2014 are helping to uncover domestic plots. The Department of Homeland Security, through its office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, has looked to increase official engagement with Muslim communities.\nThis is an important initiative, because the family and friends of suspected criminals often are the best resources for law enforcement officials. The families of the \u201cNorthern Virginia Five,\u201d for example, alerted authorities when the young men went missing last November.\nTo date, though, the government lacks a comprehensive framework for addressing Internet radicalization. Developing one will be necessary to curb the influence of intermediaries, especially those who use email, chat rooms, YouTube, Facebook, and other social media to attract would-be extremists.\nOn a broader level, policymakers need to think more aggressively about ways to counteract al-Qaeda\u2019s \u201cWest vs. Islam\u201d narrative. The Obama administration has rightly discarded phrases like \u201cwar on radical Islam\u201d that proved divisive during the early, post-9/11 years. But officials also should do more to highlight victims of terrorism, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, as a way to \u201cde-glorify\u201d jihad. The government must also continue to support and promote Muslim American community leaders who speak out against violence.\nBelow the Radar\nPeter Chalk is a senior policy analyst with the RAND Corporation and associate editor of \u201cStudies in Conflict and Terrorism.\u201d\nThe string of recent arrests involving American citizens in terror plots against the U.S. have highlighted what appears to be a trend in transnational Islamist terrorism: growing domestic radicalization. This phenomenon has appeared in the U.K., France, Germany and Australia, among others countries. Security officials in all these countries now routinely emphasize that the greatest threat they face is \u201chomegrown terrorism.\u201d\nThe number of extremist Web sites has exploded and by 2006 was thought to number around 5,000.\nWhile these individuals lack the training, resources and expertise to carry out attacks against high-profile, well-protected facilities, they represent a serious challenge for several reasons.\nFirst, they usually have no prior attachment to extremism and, hence, typically exist below the \u201cradar\u201d screen of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This makes them extremely difficult to track\nand pre-empt.\nSecond, they are unpredictable because their actions are neither defined nor bounded by the organizational constraints that are normally imposed on members of more structured terrorist groups.\nThird, while they lack the ability to hit so-called \u201chard\u201d targets decisively, they are perfectly able to attack the plethora of \u201csoft\u201d venues that abound, like shopping malls, cinemas, mass surface transportation, restaurants and office complexes.\nFourth, in the cases of religious \u201cconverts\u201d the desire to contemplate extreme violence is likely to be especially strong as this may well be viewed as the most visible way of demonstrating and validating their Islamist credentials. Finally, they can greatly inflate the perceived threat of militant extremism because their actions are specifically directed against places central to day-to-day lives of ordinary citizens.\nOne of the main factors serving to encourage the growth of homegrown terrorism is the Internet. The number of active extremist Web sites around the world has exploded over the last several years and by 2006 was thought to number around 5,000.\nThese forums not only provide a readily accessible virtual platform through which to disseminate extremist propaganda, in so doing they also act as a highly powerful means for self-radicalization. And as cases in the U.S. show, the audiences for these sites are not necessarily Muslims.\nWhat does all this mean for future threat containment? A trend toward homegrown terrorism should presumably reduce strategic attacks against iconic targets and venues. But locally radicalized individuals will provide al-Qaeda and associated movements with an amorphous cadre of militants that can be used to show that the transnational terror threat is one that exists in all places at all times.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

A government agent types in a name or an overseas Internet address or some other identifier; the request goes to the company\u2019s legal department, which makes sure it follows the standard form; and the data is placed on a special file server that is continuously updated. The N.S.A. or the F.B.I. can go into that special server at any time and retrieve what it wants.\nIt\u2019s all very clean and easy and routine.\nBut one company isn\u2019t playing along. When requests come in to Twitter, it still has to turn over the data, but it hasn\u2019t built one of these automated systems. The exact method that Twitter uses for transmission isn\u2019t known, but presumably it processes the requests manually, which takes more time and requires more work for both the company and the government.\nIt\u2019s true that Twitter doesn\u2019t handle as much secret and possibly dangerous data as Google, Facebook, or Yahoo, which are all cooperating. And most tweets, after all, are public. But there are plenty of private messages and private accounts on Twitter, as well as data on when users log on and from where, and the government is clearly interested in the information.\nDuring the second half of 2012, the government asked for Twitter\u2019s data on individuals 815 times, a 20 percent increase over the previous six months. Twitter complied with the requests 69 percent of the time. (By comparison, Google complied with 88 percent of the 8,438 requests it received in the same period.)\nTwitter deserves praise for declining to make this process seamless for the government. The more convenient these requests for information are to make, the more of them there will be. If it\u2019s easy for the government to request broad and sweeping troves of information from Internet companies \u2014 if the companies don\u2019t make a fuss about each one \u2014 then it\u2019s more likely that the communications of innocent Americans will be caught up in a dragnet intended for foreigners.\nBut if each request is a hard slog, the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. might think twice about making them, making sure each one is narrow and justified.\nOr maybe I\u2019m just imagining things, and that N.S.A. analyst is laughing harder than ever right now.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

From there, they try to tease out patterns related to the malady\u2019s cause and prevalence, and begin working on solutions to quell it.\nFor tracking sick frogs, toads and salamanders, it turns out that the same principle applies. Researchers have assembled an interactive map documenting the global emergence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the amphibian chytrid fungal disease that is blazing through populations of water-dwelling animals around the world.\nScientists are still struggling to understand this plague, regarding it as a major threat to the survival of many amphibian species. The research team hopes that the map will bring together fragmented research efforts and present an overarching picture of the problem.\nDeanna Olson, a research ecologist at the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Research Station in Oregon, and her colleagues are ebullient over\ntheir success in assembling a world network of scientists and managers that are interested in conducting real-time surveillance. \u201cThis is allowing us to track what we know about this disease, which has been\nimplicated in mass mortality events as well as some extinctions at the global scale,\u201d she said.\nAlong with colleagues from Imperial College in London and Oregon State University, Dr. Olson and her lab have developed an online database that currently holds more than 36,000 records of individual animals sampled in over 4,000 sites around the world. Plotting that data geographically allows the team \u2014 or any other interested party \u2014 to see where the fungus is and is not present, and where it has or has not been tested for yet.\nAnyone can upload their data to the site, and Dr. Olson\u2019s team updates it annually to make sure it reflects the latest findings in the field. The project, called Bd-Maps, got under way in 2008 and is described this week in the journal PLoS One.\nThe maps visualize data on both a global and individual country scale. Sampling sites are marked with pins that are color-coded to indicate whether the amphibians tested there turned out to be positive or negative for the disease. This allows scientists and wildlife managers to glean a quick understanding of how their area\u2019s amphibians fare as a whole.\nFrom this data, researchers can also extrapolate the odds of the disease occurring in any given location, and the level of threat that species in those locations may face. (The fungus does not affect all amphibians equally.) \u201cIn some places chytrid fungus is a huge problem, but in other places it doesn\u2019t appear to be such a problem,\u201d Dr. Olson said. \u201cFor example, in the U.S. there has only been a handful of mortality events, but places like Central America and Australia are experiencing a lot of mass mortality and even extinctions.\u201d\nThe map does have a few potential shortcomings. At this point, the team accepts any data submitted; there is no formal process of standardization or validating that the the data comes from reputable experts. That means that some places could turn up with false positives or false negatives for the disease.\nBecause the map does include so much data, however, the researchers think it still paints a fairly robust picture of the situation on the ground. The team is also applying lessons learned from this project to create a new, more stringently screened map of the occurrence of ranavirus, another disease that affects amphibians.\nDr. Olson and her colleagues designed the chytrid fungus map as a community tool for others to explore and work with, but the team has uncovered some initial findings on its own. According to their data, 42 percent of 1,240 species sampled worldwide turned up positive for the fungus. There are more than 6,000 species of amphibians, so this means that just 20 percent have been sampled for the disease to date. From the 82 countries sampled so far, 68 percent came back with positive results.\nTemperature range stood out as a driver of fungus presence, with places that experience less fluctuation between their hot and cold seasons being more likely to be heavily afflicted by the disease. Dr. Olson hopes that other researchers will investigate whether this large-scale pattern also fits at the local scale.\nAlready, Bd-Maps is generating interesting collaborations in the field. Dr. Olson said that the map has inspired some researchers to sample new locations in the central United States, for example.\n\u201cPeople have looked at our maps and seen that nobody\u2019s reported on chytrid fungus here or there, then they\u2019ve gone out to do a study to fill in the map,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re playing a game of Risk \u2014 we\u2019re always excited to get a new place filled in, especially if it\u2019s in a remote area.\u201d\nIn other cases, researchers have used the map as a matchmaking service for chytrid fungus aficionados. An Armenian researcher recently used Bd-Maps to reach out for on-the-ground support, for example, and a scientist visiting Papua New Guinea obtained the necessary training to test for chytrid through contacts found though the the site.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t often see this type of collaboration in the research world, which is classically very much an ivory tower,\u201d Dr. Olson said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited that our project is being used at the global scale to investigate new hypotheses and patterns emerging from the data by a variety of biologists and managers.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Exactly one week later, the Guardian published a secret order from the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court, showing that the government was collecting the phone records of most Americans.\nAlmost immediately, Mr. Medine and his board were thrust into the biggest debate about privacy the country has had in many years. Members of Congress demanded that the board issue reports about the civil liberties implications of the phone-records program and another one that allows the National Security Agency to request the e-mail messages of foreigners under investigation. New leaks from the collection of documents pilfered by Edward Snowden continue to emerge every few days. And yet the privacy board still hasn\u2019t had a chance to hire most of its staff, or set up a Web site or even an e-mail address.\nThat may explain why Mr. Medine sounded a little breathless earlier today. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an exciting time,\u201d he said in an interview.\nHe also sounded determined to make his shop a real player in this debate, a promise that suggests someone might finally exercise the independent oversight now lacking in Washington. Congressional leaders and judges on the FISA court have shown themselves willing to go along with virtually any program the Obama administration requests, and the administration is not in a position to oversee its own actions.\n\u201cIn a sense we are the eyes and ears of the public,\u201d said Mr. Medine, who enforced privacy laws at the Federal Trade Commission during the 1990s and has also worked on privacy legislation for the National Economic Council at the Clinton White House. \u201cWe don\u2019t answer to the administration.\u201d\nThe board is appointed by the president \u2014 it currently consists of three Democrats, including Mr. Medine, and two Republicans \u2014 but is supposed to act on its own. It is empowered to investigate any government program or regulation, in and out of the intelligence world, and make recommendations on how to improve its privacy and civil liberties record. Agency heads are supposed to turn over any documents the board requests, and the attorney general can issue subpoenas on its behalf to the private sector.\nBut the board cannot issue public critiques of intelligence programs that are too secret for the government to acknowledge. Board members, who have top security clearances, can only secretly criticize secret programs to Congress and the White House.\n\u201cThat\u2019s our challenge, to develop public trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will take a hard look at the programs we can talk about, and then we can communicate to the president and Congress in classified form things we might not be happy with.\u201d\nMr. Medine, a Washington lawyer who has advised corporate clients on compliance with privacy regulations, didn\u2019t want to discuss his opinions of the N.S.A. revelations while the board evaluates them. (The board\u2019s reports on the two most-discussed domestic programs will be public, because they were declassified after Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks.)\nBut he said the board will try to answer several questions for every program it examines: Is it legal, operating in the manner in which Congress intended or complying with a court\u2019s authority? Is it constitutional, or does it violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures? Does it chill freedom of speech, or association, or religion? Is it sufficiently transparent and accountable? Even if it is legal, does a program strike the right balance between effectiveness and protecting civil liberties?\n\u201cA program may technically be O.K., but is it the right thing to be doing?\u201d Mr. Medine asked. \u201cDoes it need to be disclosed to others, and is there another way it could be done with the same effectiveness in combating terrorism?\u201d\nAt the moment, only a few isolated voices in government are asking these good questions. The board has met with President Obama and received a classified briefing on the secret surveillance programs. It plans a public workshop with privacy advocates on Tuesday. But before these issues get swept away in the next Washington crisis, its members need to dig in and raise their voices as loud as possible.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

What has received less attention is the fact that most intelligence work today is not carried out by government agencies but by private intelligence firms and that much of that work involves another common aspect of intelligence work: deception. That is, it is involved not just with the concealment of reality, but with the manufacture of it.\nThe realm of secrecy and deception among shadowy yet powerful forces may sound like the province of investigative reporters, thriller novelists and Hollywood moviemakers \u2014 and it is \u2014 but it is also a matter for philosophers. More accurately, understanding deception and and how it can be exposed has been a principle project of philosophy for the last 2500 years. And it is a place where the work of journalists, philosophers and other truth-seekers can meet.\nIn one of the most referenced allegories in the Western intellectual tradition, Plato describes a group of individuals shackled inside a cave with a fire behind them. They are able to see only shadows cast upon a wall by the people walking behind them. They mistake shadows for reality. To see things as they truly are, they need to be unshackled and make their way outside the cave. Reporting on the world as it truly is outside the cave is one of the foundational duties of philosophers.\nIn a more contemporary sense, we should also think of the efforts to operate in total secrecy and engage in the creation of false impressions and realities as a problem area in epistemology \u2014 the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of knowledge. And philosophers interested in optimizing our knowledge should consider such surveillance and deception not just fodder for the next \u201cMatrix\u201d movie, but as real sort of epistemic warfare.\nTo get some perspective on the manipulative role that private intelligence agencies play in our society, it is worth examining information that has been revealed by some significant hacks in the past few years of previously secret data.\nImportant insight into the world these companies came from a 2010 hack by a group best known as LulzSec (at the time the group was called Internet Feds), which targeted the private intelligence firm HBGary Federal. That hack yielded 75,000 e-mails. It revealed, for example, that Bank of America approached the Department of Justice over concerns about information that WikiLeaks had about it. The Department of Justice in turn referred Bank of America to the lobbying firm Hunton and Willliams, which in turn connected the bank with a group of information security firms collectively known as Team Themis.\nTeam Themis (a group that included HBGary and the private intelligence and security firms Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies and Endgame Systems) was effectively brought in to find a way to undermine the credibility of WikiLeaks and the journalist Glenn Greenwald (who recently broke the story of Edward Snowden\u2019s leak of the N.S.A.\u2019s Prism program), because of Greenwald\u2019s support for WikiLeaks. Specifically, the plan called for actions to \u201csabotage or discredit the opposing organization\u201d including a plan to submit fake documents and then call out the error. As for Greenwald, it was argued that he would cave \u201cif pushed\u201d because he would \u201cchoose professional preservation over cause.\u201d That evidently wasn\u2019t the case.\nTeam Themis also developed a proposal for the Chamber of Commerce to undermine the credibility of one of its critics, a group called Chamber Watch. The proposal called for first creating a \u201cfalse document, perhaps highlighting periodical financial information,\u201d giving it to a progressive group opposing the Chamber, and then subsequently exposing the document as a fake to \u201cprove that U.S. Chamber Watch cannot be trusted with information and/or tell the truth.\u201d\n(A photocopy of the proposal can be found here.)\nIn addition, the group proposed creating a \u201cfake insider persona\u201d to infiltrate Chamber Watch. They would \u201ccreate two fake insider personas, using one as leverage to discredit the other while confirming the legitimacy of the second.\u201d\nPsyops need not be conducted by nation states; they can be undertaken by anyone with the capabilities and the incentive to conduct them.\nThe hack also revealed evidence that Team Themis was developing a \u201cpersona management\u201d system \u2014 a program, developed at the specific request of the United States Air Force, that allowed one user to control multiple online identities (\u201csock puppets\u201d) for commenting in social media spaces, thus giving the appearance of grass roots support. The contract was eventually awarded to another private intelligence firm.\nThis may sound like nothing so much as a \u201cMatrix\u201d-like fantasy, but it is distinctly real, and resembles in some ways the employment of \u201cPsyops\u201d (psychological operations), which as most students of recent American history know, have been part of the nation\u2019s military strategy for decades. The military\u2019s \u201cUnconventional Warfare Training Manual\u201d defines Psyops as \u201cplanned operations to convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.\u201d In other words, it is sometimes more effective to deceive a population into a false reality than it is to impose its will with force or conventional weapons. Of course this could also apply to one\u2019s own population if you chose to view it as an \u201cenemy\u201d whose \u201cmotives, reasoning, and behavior\u201d needed to be controlled.\nPsyops need not be conducted by nation states; they can be undertaken by anyone with the capabilities and the incentive to conduct them, and in the case of private intelligence contractors, there are both incentives (billions of dollars in contracts) and capabilities.\nSeveral months after the hack of HBGary, a Chicago area activist and hacker named Jeremy Hammond successfully hacked into another private intelligence firm \u2014 Strategic Forcasting Inc., or Stratfor), and released approximately five million e-mails. This hack provided a remarkable insight into how the private security and intelligence companies view themselves vis a vis government security agencies like the C.I.A. In a 2004 e-mail to Stratfor employees, the firm\u2019s founder and chairman George Friedman was downright dismissive of the C.I.A.\u2019s capabilities relative to their own: \u201cEveryone in Langley [the C.I.A.] knows that we do things they have never been able to do with a small fraction of their resources. They have always asked how we did it. We can now show them and maybe they can learn.\u201d\nThe Stratfor e-mails provided us just one more narrow glimpse into the world of the private security firms, but the view was frightening. The leaked e-mails revealed surveillance activities to monitor protestors in Occupy Austin as well as Occupy\u2019s relation to the environmental group Deep Green Resistance. Staffers discussed how one of their own men went undercover (\u201cU/C\u201d) and inquired about an Occupy Austin General Assembly meeting to gain insight into how the group operates.\nRelated\nMore From The Stone\nRead previous contributions to this series.\nStratfor was also involved in monitoring activists who were seeking reparations for victims of a chemical plant disaster in Bhopal, India, including a group called Bophal Medical Appeal. But the targets also included The Yes Men, a satirical group that had humiliated Dow Chemical with a fake news conference announcing reparations for the victims. Stratfor regularly copied several Dow officers on the minutia of activities by the two members of the Yes Men.\nOne intriguing e-mail revealed that the Coca-Cola company was asking Stratfor for intelligence on PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) with Stratfor vice president for Intelligence claiming that \u201cThe F.B.I. has a classified investigation on PETA operatives. I\u2019ll see what I can uncover.\u201d From this one could get the impression that the F.B.I. was in effect working as a private detective Stratfor and its corporate clients.\nStratfor also had a broad-ranging public relations campaign. The e-mails revealed numerous media companies on its payroll. While one motivation for the partnerships was presumably to have sources of intelligence, Stratfor worked hard to have soap boxes from which to project its interests. In one 2007 e-mail, it seemed that Stratfor was close to securing a regular show on NPR: \u201c[the producer] agreed that she wants to not just get George or Stratfor on one time on NPR but help us figure the right way to have a relationship between \u2018Morning Edition\u2019 and Stratfor.\u201d\nOn May 28 Jeremy Hammond pled guilty to the Stratfor hack, noting that even if he could successfully defend himself against the charges he was facing, the Department of Justice promised him that he would face the same charges in eight different districts and he would be shipped to all of them in turn. He would become a defendant for life. He had no choice but to plea to a deal in which he may be sentenced to 10 years in prison. But even as he made the plea he issued a statement, saying \u201cI did this because I believe people have a right to know what governments and corporations are doing behind closed doors. I did what I believe is right.\u201d (In a video interview conducted by Glenn Greenwald with Edward Snowden in Hong Kong this week, Snowden expressed a similar ethical stance regarding his actions.)\nGiven the scope and content of what Hammond\u2019s hacks exposed, his supporters agree that what he did was right. In their view, the private intelligence industry is effectively engaged in Psyops against American public., engaging in \u201cplanned operations to convey selected information to [us] to influence [our] emotions, motives, objective reasoning and, ultimately, [our] behavior\u201d? Or as the philosopher might put it, they are engaged in epistemic warfare.\nThe Greek word deployed by Plato in \u201cThe Cave\u201d \u2014 aletheia \u2014 is typically translated as truth, but is more aptly translated as \u201cdisclosure\u201d or \u201cuncovering\u201d \u2014 literally, \u201cthe state of not being hidden.\u201d Martin Heidegger, in an essay on the allegory of the cave, suggested that the process of uncovering was actually a precondition for having truth. It would then follow that the goal of the truth-seeker is to help people in this disclosure \u2014 it is to defeat the illusory representations that prevent us from seeing the world the way it is. There is no propositional truth to be had until this first task is complete.\nThis is the key to understanding why hackers like Jeremy Hammond are held in such high regard by their supporters. They aren\u2019t just fellow activists or fellow hackers \u2014 they are defending us from\nepistemic attack. Their actions help lift the hood that is periodically pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth.\nPeter Ludlow is a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University and is currently co-producing (with Vivien Weisman) a documentary on Hacktivist actions against private intelligence firms and the surveillance state.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Without sensible limits on the use of surveillance drones, government entities \u2013 the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, your local police department \u2013 will almost inevitably use drones to collect huge volumes of sensitive information about people who\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\nThe available technology is already incredibly powerful. A surveillance drone can already be used to track a person as she travels from, say, her house to her doctor\u2019s office to her place of worship to her school. Within a few years, it may be perfectly feasible, economically and technologically, for a local police department to use unmanned drones to collect the identities of those who attend political rallies.\nSome of the information that surveillance drones can collect might seem innocuous and not worth protecting. But, as the Supreme Court recently recognized, new technologies that allow the collection of huge volumes of seemingly innocuous information can easily be used to create detailed dossiers about innocent citizens.\nIt\u2019s not that the domestic use of surveillance drones should be categorically prohibited. These drones can be put to all sorts of laudable uses. They can be used, for example, for geological and environmental surveys. They could be used by ordinary citizens to monitor the conduct of police. An Op-Ed in this newspaper recently argued that drones should be used to monitor human rights abuses in Syria.\nBut it\u2019s crucial that we place clear limits on the use of drones to collect information about citizens. Law enforcement agencies should generally be prohibited from using surveillance drones except to monitor those who are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity. When surveillance will be particularly intrusive \u2013 for example, if it will be prolonged, or if it will include peering through a window \u2013 the surveillance should be based on a warrant and probable cause. And when the government collects information incidentally about individuals who aren\u2019t suspected of criminal activity, or when criminal suspects turn out to be innocent, the information the government has collected should be discarded.\nDrones will no doubt prove to have many good uses, but we need to adopt some rules to protect privacy.\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Both companies sell spyware to governments that they say is used exclusively for criminal investigations, but mounting evidence suggests that their spyware has been used to monitor dissidents.\nIn August, an article in The New York Times outlined how spyware sold by the Gamma Group had been used to monitor Bahraini activists and spy on people via servers in more than a dozen countries \u2014 many with questionable human rights records, like Brunei and Turkmenistan. At first, the Gamma Group denied that its software was being used this way. Then it said several copies of its spyware had been stolen.\nOn Wednesday, Morgan Marquis-Boire, one of the first security researchers to discover Gamma spyware in e-mails sent to Bahraini activists, released new evidence suggesting that spyware sold by Hacking Team had also been used to monitor political activists.\nSuch spyware gives governments that previously had no cybersurveillance programs a sophisticated plug-in monitoring operation that can track a citizen\u2019s location, record their every keystroke, read e-mails, social networking and instant messenger chats, and even remotely switch on a device\u2019s camera or microphone to record their conversations.\nThe market for such technologies has grown to $5 billion from \u201cnothing 10 years ago,\u201d Jerry Lucas, president of TeleStrategies, the company behind ISS World, told The Times in August.\nIn his most recent findings, Mr. Marquis-Boire, a security researcher with the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said he had discovered Hacking Team\u2019s government-grade spyware included in a Microsoft Word attachment sent to a political activist in the United Arab Emirates, and also embedded in a link posted to a Moroccan news Web site.\nA member of Hacking Team\u2019s finance department said he was not aware of Mr. Marquis-Boire\u2019s findings and that executives at the company were not available for comment on Wednesday.\nIn July, Ahmed Mansoor, an outspoken blogger from the United Arab Emirates and a member of the \u201cU.A.E. Five\u201d \u2014 a group of Emirati activists jailed last year for criticizing government leaders \u2014 opened a suspicious e-mail with a Microsoft Word attachment that, when opened, deployed spyware that could monitor his every keystroke, record his passwords, social networking and instant messenger chats and even his voice conversations through his computer\u2019s microphone. Mr. Mansoor told Bloomberg that because of that innocent mistake\u2013 clicking on a malicious e-mail attachment\u2013 he was inexplicably beaten by unknown assailants.\nThat same month, a suspicious message was posted to a submission page on Mamkafinch.com, a Moroccan news Web site that has been critical of Morocco\u2019s government. The message, which was posted in French, translated roughly as: \u201cPlease do not mention my name or anything I do. I do not want any shenanigans,\u201d and included a link that, if opened, took control of the person\u2019s device.\nMr. Marquis-Boire said he had been able to match the spyware contained in both the e-mail attachment and malicious link to a demonstration copy of Hacking Team\u2019s spyware, which the company markets this way: \u201cRemote Control System is a stealth investigative tool dedicated to law enforcement and security agencies for digital investigations. It is an eavesdropping software which hides itself inside the target devices. It enables both active data monitoring and process control.\u201d\nIn the case of Mr. Mansoor, the spyware eavesdropped from a server that, as of August, was registered to a post office box in Abu Dhabi that matched the corporate headquarters of the Royal Group, a U.A.E. conglomerate. In the case of Mamfakinch, the spyware was controlled by an I.P. address hosted in Rabat, Morocco\u2019s capital.\nExecutives at the Royal Group could not be reached for comment. A representative at Morocco\u2019s consulate in New York did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe release of Mr. Marquis-Boire\u2019s findings is timed just one day before executives at the Gamma Group and Hacking Team are scheduled to take the stage at ISS World. On Thursday, Martin J. Muench, a Gamma Group managing director, will deliver a presentation titled \u201cGovernment I.T. Intrusion: Applied Hacking Techniques Used by Governments.\u201d After his presentation, three Hacking Team executives will talk about their latest government-grade surveillance technology.\nMr. Marquis-Boire said the timing of his release was coincidental. In an interview on Tuesday, he said, \u201cThese companies say they only sell this spyware to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies, but the key takeaway is \u2018Know thy customer.\u2019 \u201c", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

While Iceland is not a member of the union, it is bound by most of its rules as a member of E.F.T.A.\nThe case has attracted widespread attention because it touches on issues of cross-border banking that have been at the center of the European Union\u2019s efforts to ensure the future stability of the region\u2019s financial system. The Iceland banking collapse in 2008 \u2014 and the mayhem it caused far beyond the country\u2019s borders \u2014 raised issues directly relevant to the 27-nation European Union.\nMonday\u2019s court ruling in Luxembourg is a significant victory for Iceland. Unlike Ireland, Iceland declined to use taxpayer money to bail out foreign bondholders and depositors. This set off a bitter dispute with Britain, which used antiterrorism rules to take control of assets held in Britain by Icesave\u2019s parent, Landsbanki.\nIn an interview this month with British television, Iceland\u2019s president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, denounced the British government\u2019s approach of using antiterrorist rules to seize Icelandic assets. \u201cWe were there together with Al Qaeda and the Taliban on that list,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not forgotten that in Iceland.\u201d\nAfter the 2008 crash, the Icelandic government tried twice to settle the Icesave debts. But the country\u2019s voters, asked to approve settlement plans in two separate referendums, rejected the proposals. Foreign holders of bonds issued by Landsbanki and two other failed Icelandic banks lost some $85 billion.\nThose losses were not at issue in the Luxembourg case, which involved only customers with bank deposits.\nThe Icelandic government, in a statement by its foreign ministry after Monday\u2019s verdict, said that Landsbanki had already paid out some $4.5 billion to Icesave depositors, covering nearly half of all initial claims by individuals, charities and others in Britain and the Netherlands. The ministry said the bank would eventually reimburse the rest.\n\u201cIt is a considerable satisfaction that Iceland\u2019s defense has won the day in the Icesave case,\u201d the Icelandic government said in its statement. The Luxembourg ruling, it added, \u201cbrings to a close an important stage in a long saga.\u201d\n\u201cIcesave is now no longer a stumbling block to Iceland economic recovery,\u201d it said.\nIceland\u2019s economy, which went into a nose dive after the banking crash, is now growing again. The credit ratings agency Fitch last year raised its rating of the country\u2019s debt, noting that its \u201cunorthodox crisis policy response has succeeded in preserving sovereign creditworthiness.\u201d\nBut the Icesave episode has clouded the recovery.\nIcesave collapsed in October 2008 along with Landsbanki and the rest of Iceland\u2019s banking sector in a spectacular blowout by the North Atlantic island nation\u2019s entire financial system.\nCaught in the wreckage were some 350,000 people in Britain and the Netherlands who, lured by unusually high interest rates, had put their money in Icesave accounts.\nThe Icelandic government protected the deposits of Icelanders who had money in failed banks by moving the deposits into new, solvent versions of the banks. But the government declined to cover the losses of foreigners with online accounts operated by Icesave, a move that prompted complaints of illegal discrimination to the court in Luxembourg.\nThe case against Iceland was bought by the Surveillance Authority of the European Free Trade Association and revolved around interpretation of a European Union directive requiring that deposits in European banks be covered equally by deposit guarantee systems. Britain and the Netherlands supported the case.\nBut the court, according to a statement summarizing the verdict, ruled that the directive on guaranteeing bank deposits did not oblige Icelandic authorities to ensure immediate payment to depositors in Britain and the Netherlands \u201cin a systemic crisis of the magnitude experienced in Iceland.\u201d\nIceland argued that all Icesave depositors would eventually get their money back but that the government, confronted in 2008 with a total breakdown of the financial system, did not have the means to offer immediate payment of all claims.\nThe court also cleared Iceland of complaints that it violated nondiscrimination rules when it protected domestic depositors but not foreign depositors in Icesave.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In the survey, slightly more Democrats than Republicans said they found it acceptable for the N.S.A. to track Americans\u2019 phone records and e-mails if the goal is to prevent terrorism. By comparison, when Pew Research asked a similar question in 2006, Republicans were about twice as likely as Democrats to support the N.S.A.\u2019s activities.\nThe poll is a reminder that many Americans do not hold especially firm views on some issues and instead may adapt them depending on which party controls the executive branch. When it comes to domestic surveillance, a considerable number of Democrats seem willing to support actions under President Obama that they deemed unacceptable under George W. Bush, while some Republicans have shifted in the opposite direction.\nWhat may be just as significant is the way in which attitudes toward the security state could split voters and elected officials within each party \u2014 possibly creating a wedge issue in both party primaries in 2016. Politicians who are normally associated with being on the far left and the far right may find common cause with grass-roots voters in their objection to domestic surveillance programs, fighting against a party establishment that is inclined to support them.\nTake, for example, the House\u2019s vote in May 2011 to extend certain provisions of the Patriot Act \u2014 including the so-called library records provision that the government has used to defend the legality of sweeping searches of telephone and e-mail records. The bill passed with 250 yes votes in the House against 153 no votes, receiving more of its support from Republicans. (In the Senate, the bill passed, 72-23, winning majority support from both parties.) However, the House vote was not well described by a traditional left-right political spectrum.\nIn the chart below, I\u2019ve sorted the 403 members of the House who voted on the bill from left to right in order of their overall degree of liberalism or conservatism, as determined by the statistical system DW-Nominate. Members of the House who voted for the bill are represented with a yellow stripe in the chart, while those who voted against it are represented in black.\nThe no votes are concentrated at the two ends of the spectrum. The 49 most liberal members of the House (all Democrats) who voted on the bill each voted against it. But so did 14 of the 21 Republicans deemed to be the most conservative by DW-Nominate.\nBy contrast, 46 of the 50 most moderate Republicans voted for the Patriot Act extension, as did 38 of the 50 most moderate Democrats.\nPerhaps, you might object, a one-dimensional spectrum doesn\u2019t do a very good job of capturing all the nuances of what it means to be liberal or conservative in America today. In considering the surveillance state, for example, Republicans must weigh their traditional support for aggressive antiterrorism policies against their distrust of government, while Democrats must weigh their trust of Mr. Obama, who so far has been unapologetic for the N.S.A.\u2019s actions, against their concern about civil liberties violations.\nOr more broadly, what about libertarians who take conservative views on economic policy but liberal views on social policy \u2014 or conservative Democrats who support the welfare state but not policies like gay marriage? Where are they represented on the spectrum?\nI am sympathetic toward these objections as a theoretical matter. Without making this too much of an editorial comment, I find the platforms of both parties to be lacking in philosophical cohesion \u2014 why, for example, should views on abortion have much to do with preferences on tax policy?\nBut when it comes to American political parties and their representatives in Congress, partisanship tends to dominate all other considerations. National Journal has a different system for ranking members of Congress from liberal to conservative. It is somewhat less statistically rigorous than DW-Nominate\u2019s system, but it does have the advantage of breaking votes down into three categories: those on economic, social and foreign policy.\nThe correlations between the three policy areas are very high (specifically, they are about 0.9, where 1 would represent a perfect correlation). Members of Congress who take conservative views on economic policy tend almost always to take conservative views on social policy and foreign policy as well, while members who are liberal on one set of issues tend to cast liberal votes on almost all other issues.\nThis does leave the question of how liberal and conservative policy stances are defined. (Support for gun rights, for example, is generally seen as socially conservative rather than socially liberal, even though socially liberal stances are often thought of as promoting the rights of individuals against communities or governments.) Nevertheless, for members of Congress today, a vote on any one issue is highly predictable based upon his votes on other issues. There are extremely few mavericks in Congress who vote on each issue on an independent and nonpartisan basis.\nDW-Nominate uses a different method to classify Congressional votes. Instead of assigning a subjective definition to each vote as liberal or conservative, it instead uses an automated process called optimal classification. The goal of this process is essentially to explain the highest number of Congressional votes based on a one-dimensional scale, regardless of the content of the legislation that comprises it. Whichever votes are not well explained by this first dimension are then explained by additional dimensions.\nThe process is more intuitive than it might sound. For example, during the 1960s, Congressional votes on civil rights policy toward African-Americans were not very strongly correlated with votes on other types of political issues. (For instance, Southern Democrats were often staunchly opposed to civil rights for blacks while casting very liberal votes on the welfare state.) Thus, you needed at least two dimensions to describe Congressional voting patterns in a reasonably comprehensive way.\nIn recent years, however, this has been much less of a problem: the one-dimensional spectrum explains about 95 percent of Congressional voting, and votes on economic, social and foreign policy are highly correlated. But a few votes still fall outside of the spectrum \u2014 the 2011 vote on the Patriot Act among them.\nIf the second dimension no longer represents a distinction between economic and social policy, then what does it reflect? The authors of DW-Nominate are interpreting it to measure a distinction between what they call \u201cestablishment\u201d members of Congress and \u201coutsiders.\u201d Here at FiveThirtyEight, I have sometimes used the same labels when describing the ideological space occupied by different candidates during the presidential primaries. Some candidates, like Mitt Romney, run as insider or establishment politicians, offering some iteration of what they say are tried-and-true solutions, while others run as insurgents or outsiders, submitting a more profound critique of politics as usual and claiming they will topple an unacceptable status quo.\nIn general, those politicians who rate as insurgents or outsiders are on the wings of the liberal-conservative scale. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and Ron Paul movements probably all fit into the outsider or insurgent category, for example, even though they inhabit vastly different spaces on the traditional left-right political spectrum.\nConversely, moderates in both parties tend to score as establishment politicians. There aren\u2019t very many \u201cradical centrist\u201d members of Congress who offer a pronounced critique of the status quo while also coming down somewhere in the middle on most policy issues.\nIn the case of the Patriot Act vote, the establishment-outsider axis makes nearly as much difference as the liberal-conservative or Democratic-Republican scales. Among the so-called establishment members of the House who voted on the bill, 78 percent voted to extend the Patriot Act, while only 41 percent of the so-called outsiders did, according to DW-Nominate\u2019s classifications.\nYou can find similar patterns in certain votes on policy toward the financial sector \u2014 for example, during the various bailout votes that were cast toward the end of 2008. More recently, votes on the federal debt ceiling have taken on some of the same contours.\nWhat is the link between the financial votes and those on the surveillance state? In both cases, members of Congress were asked to trust the assertions of elites that significant harms would result if the bills were not enacted: terrorist acts in the event that the Patriot Act was not extended, or financial calamity in the event that the bailout was not passed or the debt ceiling was not raised.\nAs a matter of practice (but not necessarily theory), convincing someone that a future crisis must be averted requires a higher level of persuasion than making the case for a policy that is claimed to ameliorate some extant problem. Members of Congress who are members of their party establishments might be more inclined to trust testimony from financial or national security elites, and therefore might have been easier to pitch on these bills.\nWe should be careful about extrapolating the voting behavior of Congress to policy views among the general public. But as I have suggested, the establishment-outsider divide can loom large in presidential primaries. Particularly within the Republican Party, rank-and-file voters have increasingly lukewarm views of the party leadership. But Democrats will also face a primary after Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure in office. Highly liberal, activist voters who might ordinarily be inclined to critique the status quo could face some awkward questions given that the status quo has featured a Democratic president.\nDebates on domestic surveillance could serve as proxy battles for these intraparty factions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, perhaps along with other Republican candidates, could use his opposition to surveillance programs to help consolidate the support of libertarian and Tea Party voters, at the risk of alienating national security conservatives. Democratic candidates who criticize the Patriot Act or the N.S.A.\u2019s actions will be finding fault with policies that Mr. Obama has defended \u2013 and Mr. Obama will very likely remain quite popular among Democrats three years from now.\nPrecisely because public opinion on domestic surveillance policy is malleable (as evidenced by the Pew survey), it may come to take on symbolic power. How inclined will Democrats be to support policies that they might otherwise oppose because Mr. Obama pledges that the N.S.A. is using the information it collects appropriately? How much are Republicans willing to believe national security officials appointed by Mr. Obama \u2014 defending policies that were often first enacted under Mr. Bush?\nHow does someone in either party weigh the desire to prevent terrorist attacks against the image of a bureaucrat snooping through his in-box?\nThe phrase \u201ctrust in government\u201d is often invoked in a political context, but its meaning is usually metaphorical, referring to how much a voter might prefer public-sector decisions to those that might be left to the private sector or to individuals. Here, it means something rather more literal: do you trust officials within the government to carry out their national security mission without abusing their powers? Do you trust them when they say that the trade-off between security and liberty is worthwhile \u2014 especially when many of the threats they claim to be preventing are based on classified information that you aren\u2019t privy to?\nIn some ways, it may prove invigorating to have a political debate that does not break down all that neatly into the usual partisan camps. And because they create as many fractures across the parties as between them, the recent N.S.A. disclosures might not have all that much effect, for instance, on Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings or the Congressional elections next year.\nBut there\u2019s the possibility that surveillance policy could become a major issue in the 2016 primaries, as elites in each party defend themselves against rank-and-file voters who are critical of their judgment.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In considering the surveillance state, for example, Republicans must weigh their traditional support for aggressive antiterrorism policies against their distrust of government, while Democrats must weigh their trust of Mr. Obama, who so far has been unapologetic for the N.S.A.\u2019s actions, against their concern about civil liberties violations.\nOr more broadly, what about libertarians who take conservative views on economic policy but liberal views on social policy \u2014 or conservative Democrats who support the welfare state but not policies like gay marriage? Where are they represented on the spectrum?\nI am sympathetic toward these objections as a theoretical matter. Without making this too much of an editorial comment, I find the platforms of both parties to be lacking in philosophical cohesion \u2014 why, for example, should views on abortion have much to do with preferences on tax policy?\nBut when it comes to American political parties and their representatives in Congress, partisanship tends to dominate all other considerations. National Journal has a different system for ranking members of Congress from liberal to conservative. It is somewhat less statistically rigorous than DW-Nominate\u2019s system, but it does have the advantage of breaking votes down into three categories: those on economic, social and foreign policy.\nThe correlations between the three policy areas are very high (specifically, they are about 0.9, where 1 would represent a perfect correlation). Members of Congress who take conservative views on economic policy tend almost always to take conservative views on social policy and foreign policy as well, while members who are liberal on one set of issues tend to cast liberal votes on almost all other issues.\nThis does leave the question of how liberal and conservative policy stances are defined. (Support for gun rights, for example, is generally seen as socially conservative rather than socially liberal, even though socially liberal stances are often thought of as promoting the rights of individuals against communities or governments.) Nevertheless, for members of Congress today, a vote on any one issue is highly predictable based upon his votes on other issues. There are extremely few mavericks in Congress who vote on each issue on an independent and nonpartisan basis.\nDW-Nominate uses a different method to classify Congressional votes. Instead of assigning a subjective definition to each vote as liberal or conservative, it instead uses an automated process called optimal classification. The goal of this process is essentially to explain the highest number of Congressional votes based on a one-dimensional scale, regardless of the content of the legislation that comprises it. Whichever votes are not well explained by this first dimension are then explained by additional dimensions.\nThe process is more intuitive than it might sound. For example, during the 1960s, Congressional votes on civil rights policy toward African-Americans were not very strongly correlated with votes on other types of political issues. (For instance, Southern Democrats were often staunchly opposed to civil rights for blacks while casting very liberal votes on the welfare state.) Thus, you needed at least two dimensions to describe Congressional voting patterns in a reasonably comprehensive way.\nIn recent years, however, this has been much less of a problem: the one-dimensional spectrum explains about 95 percent of Congressional voting, and votes on economic, social and foreign policy are highly correlated. But a few votes still fall outside of the spectrum \u2014 the 2011 vote on the Patriot Act among them.\nIf the second dimension no longer represents a distinction between economic and social policy, then what does it reflect? The authors of DW-Nominate are interpreting it to measure a distinction between what they call \u201cestablishment\u201d members of Congress and \u201coutsiders.\u201d Here at FiveThirtyEight, I have sometimes used the same labels when describing the ideological space occupied by different candidates during the presidential primaries. Some candidates, like Mitt Romney, run as insider or establishment politicians, offering some iteration of what they say are tried-and-true solutions, while others run as insurgents or outsiders, submitting a more profound critique of politics as usual and claiming they will topple an unacceptable status quo.\nIn general, those politicians who rate as insurgents or outsiders are on the wings of the liberal-conservative scale. The Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street and Ron Paul movements probably all fit into the outsider or insurgent category, for example, even though they inhabit vastly different spaces on the traditional left-right political spectrum.\nConversely, moderates in both parties tend to score as establishment politicians. There aren\u2019t very many \u201cradical centrist\u201d members of Congress who offer a pronounced critique of the status quo while also coming down somewhere in the middle on most policy issues.\nIn the case of the Patriot Act vote, the establishment-outsider axis makes nearly as much difference as the liberal-conservative or Democratic-Republican scales. Among the so-called establishment members of the House who voted on the bill, 78 percent voted to extend the Patriot Act, while only 41 percent of the so-called outsiders did, according to DW-Nominate\u2019s classifications.\nYou can find similar patterns in certain votes on policy toward the financial sector \u2014 for example, during the various bailout votes that were cast toward the end of 2008. More recently, votes on the federal debt ceiling have taken on some of the same contours.\nWhat is the link between the financial votes and those on the surveillance state? In both cases, members of Congress were asked to trust the assertions of elites that significant harms would result if the bills were not enacted: terrorist acts in the event that the Patriot Act was not extended, or financial calamity in the event that the bailout was not passed or the debt ceiling was not raised.\nAs a matter of practice (but not necessarily theory), convincing someone that a future crisis must be averted requires a higher level of persuasion than making the case for a policy that is claimed to ameliorate some extant problem. Members of Congress who are members of their party establishments might be more inclined to trust testimony from financial or national security elites, and therefore might have been easier to pitch on these bills.\nWe should be careful about extrapolating the voting behavior of Congress to policy views among the general public. But as I have suggested, the establishment-outsider divide can loom large in presidential primaries. Particularly within the Republican Party, rank-and-file voters have increasingly lukewarm views of the party leadership. But Democrats will also face a primary after Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure in office. Highly liberal, activist voters who might ordinarily be inclined to critique the status quo could face some awkward questions given that the status quo has featured a Democratic president.\nDebates on domestic surveillance could serve as proxy battles for these intraparty factions. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, perhaps along with other Republican candidates, could use his opposition to surveillance programs to help consolidate the support of libertarian and Tea Party voters, at the risk of alienating national security conservatives. Democratic candidates who criticize the Patriot Act or the N.S.A.\u2019s actions will be finding fault with policies that Mr. Obama has defended \u2013 and Mr. Obama will very likely remain quite popular among Democrats three years from now.\nPrecisely because public opinion on domestic surveillance policy is malleable (as evidenced by the Pew survey), it may come to take on symbolic power. How inclined will Democrats be to support policies that they might otherwise oppose because Mr. Obama pledges that the N.S.A. is using the information it collects appropriately? How much are Republicans willing to believe national security officials appointed by Mr. Obama \u2014 defending policies that were often first enacted under Mr. Bush?\nHow does someone in either party weigh the desire to prevent terrorist attacks against the image of a bureaucrat snooping through his in-box?\nThe phrase \u201ctrust in government\u201d is often invoked in a political context, but its meaning is usually metaphorical, referring to how much a voter might prefer public-sector decisions to those that might be left to the private sector or to individuals. Here, it means something rather more literal: do you trust officials within the government to carry out their national security mission without abusing their powers? Do you trust them when they say that the trade-off between security and liberty is worthwhile \u2014 especially when many of the threats they claim to be preventing are based on classified information that you aren\u2019t privy to?\nIn some ways, it may prove invigorating to have a political debate that does not break down all that neatly into the usual partisan camps. And because they create as many fractures across the parties as between them, the recent N.S.A. disclosures might not have all that much effect, for instance, on Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings or the Congressional elections next year.\nBut there\u2019s the possibility that surveillance policy could become a major issue in the 2016 primaries, as elites in each party defend themselves against rank-and-file voters who are critical of their judgment.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

He says the growing complexity and volume of Web traffic will only make government censorship harder.\nWhen Google made the surprising announcement on Tuesday that it would no longer censor search results in China, it was applauded by human rights advocates around the world. Since China isn\u2019t likely to allow unfiltered results, which would bring up banned topics, Google would have to quit operating google.cn, its Chinese search engine.\nBut that may not be the end of the story. The very tech savvy are starting to work around the government\u2019s filters. Is it just a matter of time before the technologists defeat censorship broadly? What kinds of technological advances would that involve? Or will governments like China be able to maintain strong censorship control with ever more advanced technology on their side?\n- Jonathan Zittrain, Harvard Law School\n- Steven M.

Lee, Princeton\u2019s Center for Information Technology Policy\n- Mikko Hypponen, F-Secure Corporation\n- Tyler Moore, Center for Research on Computation and Society\n- Ron Deibert, University of Toronto\n- James Andrew Lewis, Center for Strategic and International Studies\n- Ross Anderson, Cambridge University\nWhat Web Sites Can Do\nJonathan Zittrain, a professor of law at Harvard Law School and co-founder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, is the author of \u201cThe Future of the Internet \u2014 And How to Stop It.\u201d\nMost ways to get around filtering are on the demand side: the user has to do some work. I\u2019d like to see some work done on the supply side, by Web sites themselves \u2014 and not just because of political censorship, but because of the many other reasons a site can become inaccessible, from a cyberattack to poor network connectivity.\nWe need a mutual aid treaty for the Internet, opted in one Web site at a time.\nWe can design new protocols so that participating Web sites can share information with one another, and in the event one goes down, others can mirror what had been there, in exchange for similar help should they be the next victims.\nIt\u2019s a kind of mutual aid treaty for the Internet, opted in one Web site at a time \u2014 creating a more robust infrastructure against all sorts of blockages. Already, we\u2019re building an infrastructure with sites like Herdict so that users can report when they can\u2019t get to a given site \u2014 something that web site operators are keen to know. As a public early warning system develops for network trouble, the next logical step is to help patch them up as they happen.\nThere\u2019s little likelihood that China would want to hermetically seal itself the way a North Korea or Cuba has sought to achieve. But there is some aspiration for a \u201cChina Wide Web\u201d where most users would find themselves accessing local content, in Chinese, for most of their surfing. That\u2019s why another trend to watch is the improvement of automatic translation tools.\nWhen the world\u2019s peoples can speak fluently with one another, whether in blog comments, Wikipedia entries, tweets or instant messages, regardless of their native languages, that will be a quantum advance in the circulation of ideas.\nA Matter of Cost\nSteven M. Bellovin is a professor of computer science at Columbia University, where he specializes in networks, security, and why the two don\u2019t get along.\nThere\u2019s a saying in the security business: \u201camateurs worry about algorithms; pros worry about economics.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that China \u2014 or any government so-minded \u2014 can censor virtually everything; it\u2019s just that the cost \u2014 cutting most communications lines, and deploying enough agents to vet the rest \u2014 is prohibitive. The more interesting question is whether or not \u201cenough\u201d censorship is affordable.\nHow much effort are people and companies outside China willing to expend on anti-censoring measures?\nThere are a variety of techniques that dissidents can use to evade the censors, ranging from obvious things like encryption to assorted anonymous networking techniques to breaking messages up into separate pieces that are nonsensical individually but turn into a real message when enough pieces are combined.\nThey can even use pictures, either normal ones with hidden messages embedded (a technique known as \u201csteganography\u201d) to screen shots of Web pages the government wouldn\u2019t like. Of course, there are some obvious countermeasures the government could employ, but they\u2019re costly \u2014 optical character recognition from pictures is possible but not easy to do efficiently. China currently has more than 300,000,000 Internet users; using heavyweight censorship techniques on all international connections is probably not affordable.\nPredicting what will happen requires answering three imponderable questions. First, at what rate will anti-censorship technologies evolve, compared with what the censors can do? In this case, I\u2019d bet on the former; there are more people who can work on free communications than can work on blocking it.\nSecond, how much effort and money will the government expend? That will change with the political winds, and probably can\u2019t be predicted over time. Finally, and perhaps most important, how much effort are people and companies outside China willing to expend on deploying countermeasures? Most anti-censorship schemes require help from the outside: people to run anonymity services, web sites willing to permit encrypted access to all of their content, etc. (To give one example, I can\u2019t read the New York Times using https. Either the Web site wasn\u2019t set up to permit it or someone decided that it was too costly.)\nIt\u2019s easy for a government to block a few sites. But what if most Internet traffic were encrypted? As Arlo Guthrie sang in Alice\u2019s Restaurant, \u201cAnd can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day walking in singin a bar of Alice\u2019s Restaurant and walking out. And friends they may thinks it\u2019s a movement.\u201d Is there a \u201cmovement\u201d?\nMaking Freedom Inconvenient\nTimothy B. Lee is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and a member of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. He blogs at Bottom-Up.\nCensorship is not primarily about technology. Human beings are much smarter than computers, and they inevitably find ways to circumvent filters to get the content they want. Rather, the basis of effective censorship in China, like all government power, is the ability to punish people in \u201creal life\u201d when they do something online the government doesn\u2019t like.\nThere is no purely technological solution because censorship is not primarily a technological problem.\nThe Chinese government knows that the \u201cGreat Firewall of China\u201d won\u2019t stop all attempts to access disfavored foreign Web sites. That is not its goal. The government simply seeks to make disfavored foreign Web sites inconvenient enough that most Chinese users will switch to homegrown alternatives that are under the government\u2019s thumb. This allows the government to focus its human resources on the small minority of people who persist in circumventing the Great Firewall.\nGoogle can do a lot of good by investing in improved circumvention technologies. A worldwide network of proxy servers helped dissidents in Iran communicate with the outside world in the weeks after last year\u2019s disputed election. Google could certainly invest in the creation of a more extensive, robust, and user-friendly network of proxy servers.\nGoogle can also help by embedding privacy-preserving and censorship- circumventing technologies more deeply into its existing products. Its recent decision to encrypt GMail access by default is a good example. Google might consider bundling circumvention software like Tor with its \u201cGoogle Pack\u201d of desktop software. The more ubiquitous such software becomes, the harder it will be for the Chinese government to distinguish innocuous uses of the technology from subversive ones.\nStill, there will never be a purely technological solution to censorship because censorship is not primarily a technological project. No software can protect a Chinese citizen from the knock on his door when he\u2019s caught using circumvention software. Nor can any software allow him to publish criticisms of the government without fear of reprisal.\nUltimately, defeating censorship is something that only the Chinese people themselves can accomplish by toppling their repressive regime. There is little that Google, or any American company, can do to directly shape the evolution of China\u2019s political system. But Google\u2019s withdrawal from China has important symbolic value. Google has become one of the world\u2019s most prestigious brands, and for the last four years it has lent undeserved legitimacy to the government\u2019s censorship efforts.\nNot a War, a Stalemate\nMikko Hypponen, an authority on cybercrime who has tracked down several online criminals, is the chief research officer at F-Secure Corporation in Helsinki, Finland.\nI don\u2019t see how Google could win against China.\nGoogle could be pushed out of China and the great firewall of China could block access to google.com and other global versions of Google.\nFor the Chinese end user, bypassing the great firewall isn\u2019t hard if you know what you\u2019re doing. However, the vast majority of the hundreds of millions of Chinese Internet users would not know how to do it.\nFor the Chinese end user, bypassing the great firewall isn\u2019t hard, but that\u2019s not the issue.\nI don\u2019t think Google and China will end up in an all-out war. Here\u2019s what I think will happen: Google or the U.S. State Department will make more accusations against China. China won\u2019t respond at all or will respond with their usual confused statements. Google will lift some, but not all of the censorship they have in place on google.cn. The Chinese government won\u2019t respond. Time will pass and this whole event will soon be forgotten.\nMeanwhile, the targeted Trojan attacks carry on as they have for several years.\nChoices Made for Business\nTyler Moore is a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Research on Computation and Society at Harvard University.\nOnline censorship will keep working so long as repressive governments continue to carry it out. I say this not because I expect governments to maintain the upper hand technologically.\nThere are technical solutions to censorship, but they may never be scalable.\nComputer scientists have long known that perfect censorship is practically impossible \u2014 holes in the great firewall can be found and filters remain incomplete. However, the goal of censorship is merely to control most, not all, of a population. Because the technologies available to fight censorship are unlikely to be adopted at a large scale, censorship will continue to be effective.\nTechnical solutions for defeating censorship were proposed and implemented a decade ago. These systems are still used today by tech-savvy activists. However, most targets of censorship \u2014 like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube \u2014 can be successfully blocked because of architectural choices made for business reasons.\nRunning Web applications by storing and distributing content from central servers under the host\u2019s control can make sense in a free society where censorship is not a significant threat. Centralized architectures are easier to design and more reliable in the absence of censorship. They also help firms control and profit from the data which has been collected from users \u2014 think of Google serving up ads based on search terms, or Facebook making friend suggestions based on the existing social network.\nUnfortunately, centralized architectures are easy targets of censorship, and from a business perspective, the advantages of the status quo outweigh the benefits of moving to a more robust design.\nOnline surveillance is another tactic used by repressive regimes (spying on dissidents triggered Google\u2019s threatened pull-out of China), and again, the available countermeasures aren\u2019t widely used. Consider e-mail. Until recently, communications between users\u2019 browsers and Gmail\u2019s servers were not encrypted by default.\nThis meant that, for instance, users checking their email at a WiFi hot-spot could have their communications eavesdropped. Even with encryption between user and server, surveillance remains possible. Because the e-mail itself is still sent unencrypted, a government could eavesdrop on the communication if the email is later intercepted (say, at an Internet service provider close to the government).\nA secure countermeasure to e-mail surveillance called PGP has been available for nearly 20 years. Using PGP, email is encrypted so that only the sender and recipient, not the email provider or any government, can read the message. So why doesn\u2019t everyone use PGP? First, it requires both sender and receiver to use the service. Second, historically it has been difficult to use. Third, the business models of Web-based email providers conflict with PGP \u2014 if the email itself is encrypted, then Gmail can\u2019t decide which ads to show you.\nIn my view, the only long-term, scalable solution to Internet censorship and surveillance is political. To that end, technology and the open Internet are essential. Efforts to transparently document censorship, such as the Open Net Initiative and Herdict, might help shame repressive governments into change.\nMore Than a Tech Problem\nRon Deibert is the director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk Centre for International Studies, a principal investigator of the OpenNet Initiative and Information Warfare Monitor projects, and the vice president of policy for Psiphon Inc.\nFor years, innovative solutions to sidestep Internet filters have plagued Internet censors. Rebellious kids, hoping to sneak a peek around parental controls, have come up with some of the best of these ideas. Others are highly sophisticated open-source systems tended to by brainy PhD.\u2019s and caffeine-fueled programmers.\nWe need a worldwide movement of citizens and policymakers to protect the Internet as an open global source of information.\nWill Google now devote some of its formidable engineering resources to the problem of censorship circumvention? Will the people behind Google mail, Google wave and Google docs bring us something like Google Free? Surely a company as powerful as Google can invent an app that guarantees Internet freedom.\nThe problem is that circumventing Internet censorship is at least as much a social and political problem now as it is technological. And that\u2019s because the nature of controls exercised in this domain are changing.\nAs documented by the OpenNet Initiative, cyberspace controls are evolving from technical filtering of Web requests to a variety of next-generation methods that are more subtle and offensive in nature. These methods can involve the imposition of stringent terms-of-use policies that stifle freedom of speech to informal pressures on Internet service providers to remove information or turn over user data they collect. More insidiously, they can include the outsourcing of computer network attacks on threatening sources of information or the use of cyberespionage systems of the type we found in Ghostnet, and which have plagued Google and other companies in recent weeks.\nThese next-generation controls are effective precisely because they do not rely on a single technological filter that can be overcome by the latest app. They create a social and political climate of risk, intimidation and fear. Social and political controls like these require social and political solutions.\nDoes this mean Google has no role to play in keeping the Internet free and open? Certainly it can make a contribution. Taking a principled stand and encouraging other companies to follow suit is a good start, as would be the donation of some of its engineering time to censorship circumvention.\nBut what is required today goes beyond what a single company can achieve, even one as vast and influential as Google. We need a worldwide movement involving citizens and policymakers to protect the Internet as an open global source of information. The onus is on all of us.\nChina May Succeed\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and directs its technology and public policy program.\nA few years ago I worked on a C.I.A. study on how information technology would change the politics of nondemocratic countries. There is clearly a political effect from access to information and the ability of regime opponents to coordinate and plan, but one country in the world has spent billions on technology to defeat this: China. We concluded that for now, the Chinese government would be able to control the political effects of information technology.\nAs manufacturing moves to Asia, it will be easier for China to build controls into the technologies its citizens use.\nChina is in a good position to succeed. As manufacturing moves to Asia, it will be easier to build controls into the technologies China\u2019s citizens use. China wants its own IT industry and has been investing for decades in the people and plants it will need to get one. The policy has two goals: expanding the ability to control IT and ending the dependence on Western technology.\nIt is important to use the right measure of success. Success for Beijing is blocking any serious opposition, not foreign content. So far, China has stayed ahead. It\u2019s a delicate dance \u2014 China wants openness for access to Western technology (and they build on openness with aggressive cyberespionage), but this same openness brings political risk. Information technology will bring political change to China, but the process will be neither quick nor easy.\nOne caveat: the study\u2019s most interesting conclusion was that IT and information had a democratizing effect if by democratization we mean broader participation in a political process rather than an endorsement of Western political values. As we\u2019ve seen with Jihadi use of the Internet, there are many outcomes that access to information and IT can bring and not all of them are favorable.\nChina\u2019s \u201cnetizens\u201d have gained some influence, and this influence will grow, but the direction it could take is uncertain. Getting a more democratic China may have more to do with how well the U.S. engages China and how persuasive our example and our rhetoric will be in pointing toward an open society rather than finding a few technological fixes to breach the great firewall.\nThe Dictator\u2019s Dilemma\nRoss Anderson is Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, England, and author of The Snooping Dragon, as well as the standard textbook Security Engineering.\nGovernments have always tried to control information, but the game is changing fast. Globalization is shifting the real power from national post offices, press censors and police forces to private companies. Overall, that\u2019s a good thing; it\u2019s easier to set up a new company than a new country.\nFiltering is becoming ever harder, and blocking entire sites now has serious side effects.\nIt\u2019s technically possible to filter the Internet but it\u2019s getting ever harder in practice because of the growing volume and complexity of traffic, and because of the growing use of encryption. And the\nconsolidation of services in large \u201cWeb 2.0\u2033 firms like Google, Microsoft and Facebook poses a new dilemma for dictators.\nIf you want to block some content on YouTube, the only practical ways to do that may be to get YouTube to cooperate, or to block the whole site: you \u201cblock it all, or not at all.\u201d But blocking it all can have serious side effects. If you block all of YouTube (as Thailand and Pakistan have tried), your schools will suffer and your population, deprived of entertainment, might get restive.\nSo, as I remarked in 2007, corporate ownership starts to matter. If you\u2019re the ruler of a large or rich country, you can maybe get YouTube to pull videos you don\u2019t like by threatening the ad revenue of its parent company Google. But if your country is poor and weak (as dictatorships tend to be) then Google just won\u2019t care. So effective censorship was increasingly limited to countries big enough for Google to care about, such as China.\nNow that the Chinese have blown it, that\u2019s great. The world is a better place. It still isn\u2019t perfect; the service companies are still bullied by some democratic governments (India about communal violence, the French and Germans about hate speech). But if that\u2019s going to be the locus of the debate on censorship in the future, we\u2019re in pretty good shape.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The news comes shortly after the central government declared its intention to abolish the labor-camp system \u2013 known in Chinese as laojiao \u2013 news that came in the report of the Third Plenum, the leadership meeting that wrapped up on Nov. 12.\nAn unidentified high-level official in the Beijing re-education through labor office was quoted in the Quanzhou Evening News as saying that a formal plan to abolish the program probably would not come until 2014.\nA United Nations Human Rights Council report from 2009 estimated that 190,000 people were being held in about 300 labor camps across China, but it has historically been very difficult to obtain accurate information\non the program. In an interview with Southern Weekend, a popular and relatively independent newspaper in Guangdong Province, Wang Gongyi, the director of the Justice\nMinistry\u2019s research institute, put the number at more than 220,000.\n\u201cAt present, the majority of the people in labor camps are there for drug abuses,\u201d Mr. Wang was quoted as saying by Southern Weekend on Sunday. \u201cApproximately 200,000 are there for drug-related crimes while other offenses only account for 20,000 to 30,000 people.\u201d\nMr. Wang said there was considerable overlap between laojiao centers and drug rehabilitation centers, raising the possibility that the two programs will undergo some form of consolidation.\nAn online inquiry made by reporters at Southern Daily revealed that at least four provincial re-education through labor websites had already added \u201cdrug rehabilitation\u201d subheadings in parenthesis after any mention of \u201cre-education through labor\u201d on their sites. Xinhua, the state-run news agency, reported that at least one former labor camp in Yunnan, a province with a relatively high rate of illegal substance abuse, will be converted into a drug rehabilitation center.\nThe re-education through labor system was first adopted in 1957 to punish minor offenders and relieve some of the pressure on the court system. But in the late 1950s, laojiao was widely used to combat \u201ccounterrevolutionary elements\u201d within the Communist Party, setting a precedent for its later use as a tool for cracking down on political dissenters and other perceived agitators.\nThe system, which is jointly run by the public security, civil affairs and education departments, allows the police to send people to labor camps for up to four years without a trial. Under China\u2019s current criminal law, the lightest penalty is three months to two years of house arrest under surveillance, while the second lightest penalty is one to six months in police detention.\n\u201cThe laojiao program can be harsher than a penalty imposed by a court,\u201d Chen Weidong, a professor of criminal procedural law at Beijing\u2019s prestigious Renmin University, told Xinhua News. \u201cThat\u2019s why some minor offenders would rather be prosecuted\u201d than undergo re-education, he said.\nWhile news of the termination of laojiao has been met with widespread public support, many experts worry that the abolition of the system will lead to an increase in other forms of extralegal detainment, such as so-called black jails, or illegal prisons, and forcible detainment at psychiatric prisons without patient consent.\nIn a statement issued on Tuesday, the Chinese Lawyers for the Protection of Human Rights vowed to vigilantly monitor the government\u2019s abolition of the re-education program. Among the six recommendations by the group were for the government to \u201cimmediately outlaw and close down extra-legal detention facilities,\u201d including the so-called legal education centers, disciplinary sites and black jails. It also urged legal accountability of officials who illegally operated these facilities.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Markey on Wednesday, an event that seemed intended to generate a push of energy two weeks before the end of a relatively sleepy campaign.\n\u201cI need Ed Markey in the United States Senate,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThis election\u2019s going to come down to turnout. We\u2019ve got a whole lot of Democrats in this state and a whole lot of Obama folks. But you can\u2019t just turn out in a presidential election \u2014 you\u2019ve got to turn out in this election.\u201d\nMr. Markey, a Democrat, is running for the seat John Kerry left open when he became secretary of state. Mr. Markey\u2019s Republican opponent, Gabriel Gomez, is a businessman and former member of the Navy SEALs who is a political newcomer.\nThe rally was Mr. Obama\u2019s first trip to Boston since he attended a memorial service here in the days after the Boston Marathon bombings \u2014 events that still loomed large over the rally. White House officials\nsaid that shortly before Mr. Obama made his speech, he met with the family of Sean Collier, the M.I.T. police officer who the authorities say was shot and killed by the bombing suspects, Tamerlan and Dzhokar Tsarnaev.\nMr. Obama opened his remarks on Wednesday by recalling the \u201cAmerican spirit\u201d he saw here after the bombing.\n\u201cThe problem we have is that spirit of generosity, and selflessness, and community, we don\u2019t see that reflected enough in our politics in Washington,\u201d said Mr. Obama, addressing a diverse crowd in the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center at Roxbury Community College. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m here today,\u201d\nOfficials from the Markey campaign said that more than 5,000 people were inside, while 2,000 more waited outside.\nMr. Obama made scant mention of Mr. Gomez during his speech, which lasted a little less than 25 minutes. He sought to paint Mr. Markey as a fitting member of a group of prominent Democrats this state has sent to the Senate, invoking Edward M. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry and Elizabeth Warren.\n\u201cNobody is better suited to continue that legacy than Ed Markey, because Ed\u2019s one of you,\u201d Mr. Obama said, drawing on Mr. Markey\u2019s working-class family background.\nMr. Obama pointed to Mr. Markey\u2019s support of gun control, women\u2019s rights and environmental protection during his 36-year Congressional career. \u201cEd has a track record, and that\u2019s why you know what he\u2019s going to do when he\u2019s a senator for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He\u2019s not somebody who comes out of nowhere and says he\u2019s for something and maybe he\u2019s for something else,\u201d Mr. Obama said, presumably alluding to Mr. Gomez. \u201cHe\u2019s been steady and he\u2019s been constant, working on your behalf.\u201d\nDuring those remarks, a group of protesters blew whistles to express solidarity with Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor who says he gave the news media documents about the agency\u2019s surveillance programs, and Bradley Manning, the Army private accused of providing government documents to WikiLeaks. The protesters were drowned out by repeated chants of \u201cObama\u201d from the surrounding crowd.\nMr. Obama compared Mr. Markey\u2019s race to his own struggles with gridlock in Washington. \u201cA whole bunch of Republicans out there are not interested in getting things done,\u201d said Mr. Obama, who continued, \u201cBecause of those attitudes, we\u2019ve got to have some Democrats like Ed Markey who will stand up and do the right thing.\u201d\nThe crowd greeted Mr. Obama with louder and longer cheers than those for Mr. Markey \u2014 although the president also elicited some playful boos when he brought up the forthcoming Stanley Cup playoffs between the Boston Bruins and his hometown team, the Chicago Blackhawks. The moment recalled another last summer, when he made an awkwardly received comment about Kevin Youkilis, a longtime Red Sox player who was moving to the Chicago White Sox.\n\u201cI am not going to talk trash about the hockey game,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about the outstanding qualities of the Chicago Blackhawks.\u201d\nBefore the rally, a line of thousands snaked through part of the campus here and up a nearby street \u2014 a show of popular excitement during a summery special election season that has so far been relatively quiet, especially when compared with the 2010 special election that brought Scott P. Brown to the Senate, and the high-octane battle in 2012 in which Ms. Warren unseated him.\n\u201cI know it seems like there\u2019s an election every other week,\u201d Mr. Obama said, according to a pool report, during a stop at Charlie\u2019s Sandwich Shoppe in the city\u2019s South End on his way to the rally, \u201cbut this one\u2019s important.\u201d\nAn earlier version of this post misspelled the given name of one of the Boston bombing suspects. He is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, not Dzohokar.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Yet, most showed little concern about their own Internet activities or phone calls\u2019 being monitored.\nA majority, 57 percent, said that the leaks about the surveillance programs would not affect the ability of the United States to prevent future terrorist attacks, while 30 percent said the fact that the programs had been made public would weaken the government\u2019s efforts to prevent terrorism.\nAccording to a CBS News poll released Tuesday evening, nearly 6 in 10 Americans said they disapproved of the federal government\u2019s collecting phone records of ordinary Americans in order to reduce terrorism.

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who has admitted to disclosing classified information about the country\u2019s government surveillance programs, left Hong Kong and is now seeking asylum in Ecuador, the foreign minister of Ecuador posted on Twitter. As our colleagues Keith Bradsher and Ellen Barry report, Mr. Snowden took a flight to Moscow, where he remained at the airport on Sunday. The Lede will be providing live updates.\n8:29 P.M. Ecuador\u2019s Foreign Minister Will Face Press Monday\nA press conference tomorrow by Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o Aroca, is not about Edward J. Snowden, but about Mr. Pati\u00f1o\u2019s trip to Asia, a spokesman for the foreign ministry has told my colleague William Neuman. He will discuss Mr. Snowden only if he is asked by the press.\nThe point may seem moot \u2014 questions on Mr. Snowden will likely be more frequent than, say, inquiries about Mr. Pati\u00f1o\u2019s favorite restaurants in Hanoi, where the press conference will be held. But perhaps it indicates that the Ecuadorean government is not gathering the press for an official announcement.\nIn the case of Julian Assange who has taken refuge, from efforts to extradite him to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual abuses, in Ecuador\u2019s embassy in London, Ecuadorean lawmakers took a little time to officially approve his request for asylum.\n\u2014 RAVI SOMAIYA\n7:24 P.M. In Interview, Assange Describes WikiLeaks\u2019 Role\nOur colleague Scott Shane interviewed Julian Assange on Sunday about the role that he and other members of the WikiLeaks organization have been playing in Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure from Hong Kong.\nMr. Assange, who has resided in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for a year because of his fugitive status, said his group had arranged for Mr. Snowden to travel via a \u201cspecial refugee travel document\u201d issued by Ecuador last Monday \u2014 days before the United States announced the criminal charges against him and revoked his passport. Mr. Assange said he believed that Ecuador was still considering Mr. Snowden\u2019s asylum application.\n\u201cHe left Hong Kong with that document,\u201d Mr. Assange said.\nMr. Assange told Mr. Shane that he had raised Mr. Snowden\u2019s case with Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister in a meeting at the embassy last Monday.\nMr. Assange said it was unclear whether Mr. Snowden\u2019s passport was revoked before he left Hong Kong. But, he said, Mr. Snowden was informed of the revocation when he landed in Moscow. He said it was uncertain whether and where Mr. Snowden might be able to travel from Moscow using the Ecuadorean document, which he described as a \u201csafe pass.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent airlines have different rules, so it\u2019s a technical matter whether they will accept the document,\u201d he said.\nHe added that the rights of refugees to travel were guaranteed by various international treaties.\nMr. Assange said that when he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy to avoid being sent to Sweden for questioning in a sexual offense investigation, Ecuador gave him \u201cinitial protection\u201d immediately and followed up two months later with a formal grant of asylum. He suggested that a similar process might be in effect with Mr. Snowden.\nMr. Assange remains in the embassy a year later, since the British authorities have not permitted him to leave without risking arrest and transfer to Sweden. He has said he is concerned less about the inquiry than the possibility that Sweden might subsequently send him to the United States to face possible charges in connection with WikiLeaks\u2019 disclosures.\nWhether Mr. Snowden could end up in a similar predicament \u2014 perhaps accepted by Ecuador or another country but unable to get there \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\u2014 SCOTT SHANE\n6:28 P.M. Snowden Is Elusive, Even Within Airport\nNone of the world\u2019s news media, gathered at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow, have yet laid eyes on Edward J. Snowden, which has prompted some Kremlinology, my colleague Ellen Barry reports.\nThe Web portal Gazeta.ru reported that around 1:30 a.m., a light was on at the second floor of the Ecuadorean Embassy, and that security appeared to be heightened.\nRussian news outlets have reported that Mr. Snowden will spend the night at a capsule hotel in the airport. Roman Alekseyev, a manager who answered the phone at the hotel on Sunday, said he could not release any information about the report that Mr. Snowden was there. Rooms at the hotel would cost about 5,500 rubles (about $170) for a 12-hour stay in a double, he said. Mr. Alekseyev said that because the hotel is in the airport\u2019s transit zone, it has a special legal status and is not considered Russian territory.\nVozdushny Ekspress, the capsule hotel where Snowden may or may not be napping. RT @RT_russian: (\u0424\u041e\u0422\u041e) //t.co/rgD87NMvlm\nThe latest, unconfirmed reports in the airport also suggested that Mr. Snowden might be in the V.I.P. hall, which is also behind passport control.\n\u2014 RAVI SOMAIYA\n5:05 P.M. Snowden Shouldn\u2019t Be Allowed to Travel, Official Says\nA State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the United States was advising governments that Mr. Snowden \u201cshould not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThe United States has been in touch via diplomatic and law enforcement channels with countries in the Western Hemisphere through which Snowden might transit or that could serve as final destinations. The U.S. is advising these governments that Snowden is wanted on felony charges, and as such, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States.\u201d\n\u2014 STEVEN LEE MYERS\n4:45 P.M. Lawmakers Threaten \u2018Consequences\u2019 for Putin\nLawmakers in the United States accused Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on Sunday of being complicit in Mr. Snowden\u2019s decision to fly from Hong Kong to Moscow, and warned of possible harm to relations between the two countries if he was not handed over.\nSenator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Putin was \u201caiding and abetting Snowden\u2019s escape.\u201d\n\u201cAllies are supposed to treat each other in decent ways, and Putin always seems almost eager to put a finger in the eye of the United States, whether it is Syria, Iran, and now, of course, with Snowden,\u201d Mr. Schumer said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not how allies should treat one another, and I think it will have serious consequences for the United States-Russia relationship.\u201d\nMr. Schumer did not say specifically what those consequences might be. Since Mr. Putin returned to the presidency last year, relations between the United States and Russia have soured significantly, and few new avenues of cooperation have emerged. Moreover, Mr. Putin has accused the United States of supporting his political rivals in Russia, though Washington denies this.\nWhen Mr. Obama entered the presidency, he vowed to hit a \u201creset\u201d button on relations with Russia in the hopes of turning around years of mutual rancor and suspicion.\nSpeaking on Fox News on Sunday, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, suggested that Mr. Snowden\u2019s arrival in Russia could snuff out with the last vestiges of those early hopes.\n\u201cThe president should be in contract with Putin saying that this whole reset button with Russia that\u2019s off if Putin allows him to leave the country and does not send him back to the United States,\u201d he said.\nHe added, referring to Mr. Snowden: \u201cThis guy is a traitor, he\u2019s a defector. He is not a hero.\u201d\n3:51 P.M. Russian Official: Revoked Passport Will Not Stop Travel\nRussian law enf official tells Ifax that Snowden\u2019s lack of a passport will not prevent his travel to Latin America. //t.co/eg3dvZHWbT\nEllen Barry, a Moscow correspondent for The Times, posted a report from Interfax, the Russian news agency, on Twitter that quotes a Russian law enforcement agency official saying Mr. Snowden would not be prevented from leaving Russia because he has no passport.\nObama administration officials confirmed that Mr. Snowden\u2019s American passport was revoked Saturday in an effort to prevent him from traveling. It was not clear whether the passport was revoked before he left Hong Kong.\n\u201cAs is routine and consistent with U.S. regulations, persons with felony arrest warrants are subject to having their passport revoked,\u201d Jennifer R. Psaki, a spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement. \u201cSuch a revocation does not affect citizenship status. Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States.\u201d\nCiting the Privacy Act, Ms. Psaki said she could not specifically discuss Mr. Snowden\u2019s passport.\nA Russian law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to Interfax, said Mr. Snowden would be allowed to continue on his journey even if the United States authorities had annulled his passport.\nIf his American passport was really invalidated, \u201cthe authorities of that country could give him a refugee document or supply him with Ecuadorean citizenship in a special procedure,\u201d the official said. \u201cWith these documents, he could definitely continue his path to Latin America.\u201d\nDavid H. Laufman, a former federal prosecutor, said it appeared that the administration had flubbed Mr. Snowden\u2019s case in at least two ways.\n\u201cWhat mystifies me is that the State Department didn\u2019t revoke his passport after the charges were filed\u201d on June 14, Mr. Laufman said. \u201cThey missed an opportunity to freeze him in place.\u201d\nHe also said he was puzzled by the decision to unseal the criminal charges on Friday, possibly prompting Mr. Snowden to flee. The standard practice in such cases is to unseal the charges only after the defendant is in custody, he said.\n\u2014 ELLEN BARRY, STEVEN LEE MYERS AND SCOTT SHANE\n3:38 P.M. N.S.A. Chief Says Snowden Caused \u2018Irreversible Damage\u2019\nIn an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d Gen. Keith B. Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency, accused Mr. Snowden of leaks that have done \u201cirreversible damage\u201d to American intelligence efforts against terrorism and other threats.\n\u201cThis is not an individual who in my opinion was acting with noble intent,\u201d General Alexander said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos.\nHe said the agency was working on building safeguards against leaks by computer systems administrators, the job that Mr. Snowden held while working for the contractor Booz Allen Hamilton at an N.S.A. station in Hawaii. He said the agency had changed passwords and was implementing a \u201ctwo man rule\u201d to reduce the chance that a lone dissenter like Mr. Snowden could make off with sensitive data.\nABC News provided a rush transcript of the interview.\nOn the CBS program, \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she did not believe that Mr. Snowden was a whistle-blower.\n\u201cI want to get him caught and brought back for trial,\u201d she said, in part to preclude more disclosures by him. She said intelligence officials had told her that Mr. Snowden \u201ccould have over 200 separate items\u201d of classified documents.\n\u2014 SCOTT SHANE\n2:23 P.M. Snowden\u2019s WikiLeaks Companion\nAs Mr. Snowden waits in an airport transit terminal in Moscow, planning his next steps, he is being counseled by a close adviser to Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder.\nWikiLeaks said in a statement on Sunday that the adviser, Sarah Harrison, traveled with Mr. Snowden when he left for Moscow from Hong Kong, where he has resided since first revealing classified documents about United States government surveillance this month.\nOn Sunday, WikiLeaks said Mr. Snowden was bound for Ecuador from Moscow, and the Ecuadorean ambassador confirmed that he had requested asylum there. Mr. Assange, who has been trying to gain asylum in Ecuador, has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for about a year amid British attempts to extradite him to Sweden.\nMs. Harrison is a British citizen who is working with the WikiLeaks legal defense team, the WikiLeaks statement said. She has also worked at the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Center for Investigative Journalism in Britain, the statement said.\nIn a video from last year, Ms. Harrison is shown announcing the release of a cache of e-mails from high-ranking Syrian government officials obtained by WikiLeaks.\n1:36 P.M. Video of Ecuador Foreign Minister Meeting With Assange\nBritain\u2019s Press Association posted a video on YouTube showing Julian Assange meeting last week with Ricardo Pati\u00f1o Aroca, Ecuador\u2019s foreign minister, at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. The report did not say whether Mr. Assange discussed Mr. Snowden\u2019s possibly seeking asylum in Ecuador.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Assange issued a statement, asking for support for Mr. Snowden.\nOn Sunday, after Mr. Snowden left Hong Kong, Mr. Aroca posted on Twitter that Mr. Snowden was seeking asylum in Ecuador.\n1:34 P.M. WikiLeaks Says Snowden Is Bound for Ecuador\nWikiLeaks has released a statement saying that Mr. Snowden \u201cis bound for the Republic of Ecuador.\u201d\nThe statement:\nMr. Edward Snowden, the American whistle-blower who exposed evidence of a global surveillance regime conducted by U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies, has left Hong Kong legally. He is bound for the Republic of Ecuador via a safe route for the purposes of asylum, and is being escorted by diplomats and legal advisors from WikiLeaks.\nMr. Snowden requested that WikiLeaks use its legal expertise and experience to secure his safety. Once Mr. Snowden arrives in Ecuador his request will be formally processed.\nFormer Spanish Judge Mr. Baltasar Garzon, legal director of WikiLeaks and lawyer for Julian Assange, has made the following statement:\n\u201cThe WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr Snowden\u2019s rights and protecting him as a person. What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange \u2014 for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest \u2014 is an assault against the people.\u201d\n12:58 P.M. Snowden Has Requested Asylum in Ecuador, Minister Says\nOn Twitter, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o Aroca, the foreign minister for Ecuador, posted that Mr. Snowden had submitted a request for asylum.\nThe Government of Ecuador has received an asylum request from Edward J. #Snowden\nEarlier on Sunday, the Ecuadorean ambassador arrived at the airport in Moscow and told reporters that he would be meeting with Mr. Snowden.\nEcuadorean ambassador arrives at Moscow airport hotel, tells journalists he expects to meet Edward #Snowden \u2013 Reuters\n11:57 A.M. Hong Kong Is Likely to Have Consulted With Beijing\nA person knowledgeable about the Hong Kong government\u2019s handling of Mr. Snowden said Sunday evening that he was sure that Hong Kong officials had consulted with the Chinese government on how to handle the case. The rough consensus in Beijing is that Mr. Snowden\u2019s presence in Hong Kong posed a threat to Chinese-American relations after President Xi Jinping has tried to improve them, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities.\nYet public opinion in Hong Kong and mainland China has made it impossible simply to send him back to the United States, the person said.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t force him to leave, the best we can do is induce him to leave,\u201d said the person, adding that Mr. Snowden had decided to leave on his own.\nThe basic issue for Beijing was that public opinion in Hong Kong and mainland China was clearly shifting toward protecting him from the United States. Mainland Chinese officials \u201cwill be relieved he\u2019s gone \u2014 the popular sentiment in Hong Kong and China is to protect him because he revealed United States surveillance here, but the governments don\u2019t want trouble in the relationship,\u201d the person said.\nThe result had been a policy driven by expedience, in which Beijing and Hong Kong both wanted Mr. Snowden to leave even though officials in both places deeply and sincerely appreciated what he had done to expose American intelligence activities on their soil. \u201cIt may not be the most honorable thing, but it is true,\u201d the person said.\nThe Hong Kong government was dismayed that the United States chose to include espionage in its charges against Mr. Snowden, because that created clear complications under the bilateral agreement between Hong Kong and the United States for the surrender of fugitives. The agreement specifically excludes the surrender of fugitives from political cases.\n\u201cIf they really want him back, they wouldn\u2019t have put that in \u2014 they would have just put that he stole something,\u201d said the person knowledgeable about the government\u2019s handling of the case.\nAnother person in Hong Kong with a deep understanding of Hong Kong\u2019s relationship with Beijing agreed that the mainland Chinese government and the Hong Kong government were both hoping Mr. Snowden would leave, although both were reluctant to take any direct action to push him out. \u201cIt saved both sides possible embarrassment if he left,\u201d said the second person, who was not involved in the Snowden decision but knew intimately the institutional framework in which the decision was made.\nHong Kong\u2019s laws prescribe that the Chinese government control Hong Kong\u2019s foreign policy. So no decision to let Mr. Snowden leave would have been made without consulting the Chinese government, said the second person, who also insisted on anonymity because of diplomatic sensitivities. \u201cThis must have been done in full consultation with Beijing,\u201d the second person said.\nBy exposing American surveillance in Hong Kong and mainland China, Mr. Snowden has already done much for China, while holding on to him could have created a serious diplomatic problem, the second person said. \u201cBeijing has gotten the most they can out of the Snowden situation,\u201d the second person said.\n\u2014 KEITH BRADSHER\n11:58 a.m. Russian News: Snowden Checked Into Moscow Airport Hotel\nAs goose chase continues, Ifax reports that Snowden will remain in airport transit area bc he doesn\u2019t have a visa. //t.co/gG97DoWOAu\nEllen Barry, our correspondent in Moscow, posted on Twitter a report from Interfax, a Russian news service, that said Mr. Snowden would remain in the airport transit area because he does not have a visa.\nAccording to the Interfax report, Mr. Snowden will leave Moscow on a plane bound for Cuba, but there were no details about when the plane is supposed to depart.\nThe next flight to Havana from Moscow is scheduled to leave Monday at 2:05 p.m. Moscow time.\nMr. Snowden had checked into a hotel in Sheremetyevo\u2019s Terminal E.\n\u201cHe cannot leave the terminal because he does not have a Russian visa,\u201d a source told Interfax. The source said that Sarah Harrison, an employee of WikiLeaks who is traveling with Mr. Snowden, has a Russian visa.\nRussia Today, Russia\u2019s English-language television station, reported that Mr. Snowden had been visited in the airport by officials from the Ecuadorean Embassy, including a doctor.\n#Snowden has been examined by doctor from Ecuador embassy at Moscow airport \u2013 RT source //t.co/iWpyC5cic6\nThe Russian news media have reported that Mr. Snowden might ultimately try to fly to Ecuador or Venezuela.\nEmbassy of Ecuador cars parked outside Moscow airport, Snowden reportedly inside #snowden //t.co/UbLvxzvJU9 //t.co/PTkSxfeBvc\nUpdate: It seems that some officials from the Ecuadorean Embassy have had trouble locating Mr. Snowden.\nEcuadorian ambassador inside Sheremtyevo airport rather confused: \u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d \u201cWe thought you did?\u201d\n11:31 A.M. Guardian Columnist: Snowden\u2019s Final Destination Unknown\nGlenn Greenwald, the columnist for The Guardian who initially broke the news of Mr. Snowden\u2019s disclosures, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that Mr. Snowden\u2019s ultimate destination was \u201cup in the air.\u201d\n\u201cWhere he\u2019s ultimately headed is unknown,\u201d Mr. Greenwald said. He said that Mr. Snowden was \u201cforced to flee\u201d because the Obama administration \u201cis engaged in an unprecedented war against whistle-blowers.\u201d\nPressed about why the former N.S.A. contractor thought that oversight by Congress and other checks on the agency were inadequate, Mr. Greenwald said Mr. Snowden brought a folder he had labeled \u201cN.S.A. Lying to Congress\u201d to their first meeting. Mr. Greenwald noted that James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, has admitted that his statement in March to Congress that N.S.A. was not collecting data on millions of America was false.\nRepresentative Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on the same program that it \u201cdefies logic\u201d that Mr. Snowden, after criticizing surveillance in the United States, would flee to more authoritarian countries like Cuba, Russia or Venezuela.\nMr. Rogers said Mr. Greenwald had mischaracterized a still-secret ruling by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as proving that the N.S.A. was violating the law. In fact, he said, the court found that the N.S.A. had \u201covercollected\u201d information for technical reasons and that the agency had moved to fix the problem.\n\u201cThis is judicial review, and there was judicial pushback,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. He said Congress, too, was informed of the over-collection, and that those internal checks had worked as designed to keep the agency under tight control.\n\u2014 SCOTT SHANE\n10:53 A.M. Video: ABC News Report of Snowden\u2019s Departure\n10:40 A.M. Hong Kong\u2019s Official Statement on Snowden\u2019s Exit\nThe official statement from the Hong Kong government released Sunday announcing Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure.\nMr. Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today (June 23) on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel.\nThe U.S. government earlier on made a request to the HKSAR government for the issue of a provisional warrant of arrest against Mr. Snowden. Since the documents provided by the U.S. government did not fully comply with the legal requirements under Hong Kong law, the HKSAR government has requested the U.S. government to provide additional information so that the Department of Justice could consider whether the U.S. government\u2019s request can meet the relevant legal conditions. As the HKSAR government has yet to have sufficient information to process the request for provisional warrant of arrest, there is no legal basis to restrict Mr. Snowden from leaving Hong Kong.\nThe HKSAR government has already informed the U.S. government of Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure.\nMeanwhile, the HKSAR government has formally written to the U.S. government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by U.S. government agencies. The HKSAR government will continue to follow up on the matter so as to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong.\n10:52 A.M. Chinese Statement on Reports of U.S. Surveillance\nOn Sunday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded to reports that Edward J. Snowden had left Hong Kong, and voiced \u201cgrave concern\u201d about allegations, attributed to Mr. Snowden, that the National Security Agency had hacked Chinese telecommunications systems and a Web site operated by Tsinghua University in Beijing. A spokeswoman said that China had already raised those allegations with the United States.\nIn a statement on the ministry\u2019s Web site, the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said of Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure: \u201cWe have seen the reports, but still have no understanding of the specific situation and are continuing to monitor developments.\u201d\nMs. Hua did not comment directly on whether the Chinese government had played any role in hastening Mr. Snowden\u2019s departure, but she cited the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle whereby Beijing gives Hong Kong considerable autonomy to make many of its own administrative decisions.\n\u201cThe central government has consistently respected the Hong Kong special administrative region government in handling matters according to the law,\u201d she said, referring to the central authorities in Beijing.\nIn a comment on the reports of American hacking of Chinese Web sites, Ms. Hua said: \u201cWe express grave concern about the recently disclosed cases of the U.S. government agency in question engaging in cyber attacks against China, and this again demonstrates that China is a victim of cyber attacks.\u201d\n\u201cWe have already made representations to the U.S. side about this,\u201d she said.\n\u2014 CHRISTOPHER BUCKLEY\n10:15 A.M. Senator Warns Russia Not to Harbor Snowden\nIn Washington, a leading Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said there would be \u201cconsequences\u201d should Russia elect to shelter Mr. Snowden.\n\u201cI believe he hurt our nation, he compromised our national security program,\u201d Mr. Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cThe freedom trail is not exactly China-Russia-Cuba-Venezuela, so I hope we\u2019ll chase him to the ends of the Earth, bring him to justice and let the Russians know there\u2019ll be consequences if they harbor this guy.\u201d\n\u201cIf they want to be part of the world community, the W.T.O., they want a good relationship with the United States, they should hold this fellow and send him back home for justice,\u201d he said, referring to the World Trade Organization.\nRussia joined the W.T.O. two years ago after nearly two decades of talk over its rights practices and trade restrictions.\nAnother Republican senator, Mike Lee of Utah, also questioned Mr. Snowden\u2019s possible choice of destinations. \u201cMr. Snowden is delusional,\u201d he said on Fox, \u201cif he thinks that he\u2019s going to find a country with a better human rights record in Moscow or in Havana or in Caracas, and I think he\u2019s in for a rude awakening if that\u2019s what he\u2019s got in mind.\u201d\n\u2014 BRIAN KNOWLTON\n10:09 A.M. U.S. Dept. of Justice Statement on Snowden\nNanda Chitre, a Justice Department spokeswoman, on Sunday confirmed that Mr. Snowden had left Hong Kong.\n\u201cAs we stated yesterday, the United States had contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Mr. Snowden, based on the criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, and in accordance with the U.S.-Hong Kong Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive Offenders,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been informed by the Hong Kong authorities Mr. Snowden has departed Hong Kong for a third country. We will continue to discuss this matter with Hong Kong and pursue relevant law enforcement cooperation with other countries where Mr. Snowden may be attempting to travel.\u201d\n\u2014 CHARLES SAVAGE\n9:54 A.M. Video of WikiLeaks Adviser, Sarah Harrison\nMr. Snowden is said to be assisted by Sarah Harrison, who was an adviser to Julian Assange when WikiLeaks released the diplomatic cables three years ago. The WikiLeaks organization said that Ms. Harrison \u201chas courageously assisted Mr. Snowden with his lawful departure from Hong Kong and is accompanying Mr. Snowden in his passage to safety.\u201d\nShe can be seen in this YouTube video giving a talk about Syria at the Frontline Club in Britain last year.\n10:05 A.M. Black Car Reportedly Picks Up Snowden\nWitnesses aboard a flight from Hong Kong to Moscow believed to be carrying Mr. Snowden said a black car pulled up beside the plane after it landed in Russia. Russia Today, Russia\u2019s English-language television station, later reported that the car belonged to the embassy of Ecuador, though the Interfax news service, citing anonymous sources, reported that representatives from Venezuela met Mr. Snowden after he left the plane. No witnesses have reported seeing Mr. Snowden on the flight or in the airport in Moscow.\n9:52 A.M. WikiLeaks and Julian Assange Statements on Snowden\nIn a statement, the WikiLeaks organization said that Mr. Snowden had requested that WikiLeaks \u201cuse its legal expertise and experience to secure his safety.\u201d\nMr. Snowden requested that WikiLeaks use its legal expertise and experience to secure his safety. Once Mr. Snowden arrives at his final destination his request will be formally processed.\nFormer Spanish Judge Mr. Baltasar Garzon, legal director of Wikileaks and lawyer for Julian Assange, has made the following statement:\n\u201cThe WikiLeaks legal team and I are interested in preserving Mr. Snowden\u2019s rights and protecting him as a person. What is being done to Mr. Snowden and to Mr. Julian Assange \u2014 for making or facilitating disclosures in the public interest \u2014 is an assault against the people.\u201d\nThe organization also published a statement by its founder, Julian Assange, on Mr. Snowden\u2019s behalf, that was made Saturday. The statement said the United States government\u2019s decision to charge Mr. Snowden was intended \u201cto intimidate any country that might be considering standing up for his rights.\u201d\n\u201cThat tactic must not be allowed to work,\u201d it said. \u201cThe effort to find asylum for Edward Snowden must be intensified.\u201d\nOur colleagues, Ms. Barry and Mr. Bradsher, report that sources said Mr. Snowden\u2019s goal was to travel to Venezuela.\n9:50 A.M.

Most notably, of course, there is the continuing outcry over the National Security Agency\u2019s call-tracking program, disclosed in the documents leaked by Edward Snowden.\nBut surveillance even surfaced as a subject in last week\u2019s televised debate among the Democratic candidates for mayor in New York. The office seekers were asked whether New York City should have more surveillance cameras. Six of the seven, card-carrying liberals all, replied without hesitation, yes. (Only Anthony Weiner said no.)\nMost of the public discussion of surveillance technology and its use revolves around the question: Is it spooky or reassuring?\nBut another issue is the effect of surveillance on behavior. And a new research paper, published on Saturday, shows in detail how significant the surveillance effect can be.\nThe paper, \u201cCleaning House: The Impact of Information Technology Monitoring on Employee Theft and Productivity,\u201d is the work of three academics: Lamar Pierce, an associate professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis; Daniel Snow, an associate professor at the Marriott School at Brigham Young University; and Andrew McAfee, a research scientist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe researchers measured the impact of software that monitors employee-level theft and sales transactions, before and after the technology was installed, at 392 restaurants in 39 states. The restaurants were in five \u201ccasual dining\u201d chains. The paper does not name the five, but it cites examples of the casual dining category including Applebee\u2019s, Chili\u2019s and Olive Garden.\nEmployee theft and fraud is a big problem, estimated at up to $200 billion a year across the economy. In the restaurant industry, analysts estimate the losses from employee theft at 1 percent of revenue. That does not seem like a lot, but restaurant profit margins are slender, typically 2 to 5 percent. So cutting down on theft can be an important contributor to a restaurant\u2019s financial health.\nMost of the restaurant industry pays its servers low wages and they depend on tips. Employee turnover is high. In that environment, a certain amount of theft has long been regarded as a normal part of the business.\nUnethical behavior runs the gamut. There is even a how-to book on the subject, published in 2004, \u201cHow To Burn Down the House: The Infamous Waiter and Bartender\u2019s Scam Bible by Two Bourbon Street Waiters.\u201d A simple example is a bartender\u2019s not charging for a round of drinks, and urging the customers to \u201ctake care of me\u201d \u2014 with a large tip. Other tactics are more elaborate.\nBut monitoring software is now available to track all transactions and detect suspicious patterns. In the new study, the tracking software was NCR\u2019s Restaurant Guard product, and NCR provided the data. The software is intentionally set so that a restaurant manager gets only an electronic theft alert in cases that seem to clearly be misconduct. Otherwise, a manager might be mired in time-consuming detective work instead of running the restaurant.\nThe savings from the theft alerts themselves were modest, $108 a week per restaurant. However, after installing the monitoring software, the revenue per restaurant increased by an average of $2,982 a week, or about 7 percent.\nThe impact, the researchers say, came not from firing workers engaged in theft, but mostly from their changed behavior. Knowing they were being monitored, the servers not only pulled back on any unethical practices, but also channeled their efforts into, say, prompting customers to have that dessert or a second beer, raising revenue for the restaurant and tips for themselves.\n\u201cThe same people who are stealing from you can be set up to succeed,\u201d said Mr. Pierce of Washington University.\nIn the research, the data sets were sizable. For example, there were more than 630,000 transactions by servers tracked and collected each week over the course of the project.\nBut more significant, the researchers say, is what the data analysis might contribute to fields of study like social psychology and behavioral economics \u2014 and the business discipline of human resources management.\nIn human resources, much emphasis is placed on employee selection: if you pick the right people, they will do the right thing. Instead, this research suggests that the surveillance effect on employee behavior is striking.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surprising is the weird effectiveness of the intervention, once the monitoring technology is in place,\u201d said Mr. McAfee of M.I.T.\nNot surprisingly, NCR is delighted by the results. \u201cIt validates the customer data we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Jeff Hindman, a vice president at NCR. \u201cBut this is done by outside experts with the academic standards and statistical rigor they bring to the analysis.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Palmisano, I.B.M.\u2019s chief executive, at the Council on Foreign Relations. At the time, the campaign seemed an ambitious, though potentially risky, move. The vision of transportation, health care, cities, retailing, finance and other fields made more intelligent with digital technology \u2014 and yes, supplied largely by I.B.M. \u2014 could have easily fizzled and been portrayed as big-think puffery, out of step with an economy in a tailspin.\nBut I.B.M.\u2019s gamble looks like a good one today. The smarter-planet campaign has covered Big Blue in the mantle of thought and technology leadership among its core customers of senior corporate executives and government officials. It has also delivered new business, helping I.B.M. hold up better than most of its industry peers; its stock price is up 50 percent in the last year.\nMr. Palmisano delivered a speech on\nWednesday Tuesday \u2014 \u201cWelcome to the Decade of Smart\u201d\n\u2014 at London\u2019s Chatham House, home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, a policy think tank. Though not meant as a lessons-learned marketing tutorial, the talk is implicitly just that.\nA few observations and excerpts:\n\u2013 Play to your strengths. To pull off smarter planet-style projects is a big-systems challenge involving computer hardware, sensor networks, specialized software and hands-on work by industry experts. No technology company has all the pieces the way I.B.M. does, able to position itself as the digital general contractor for big projects, often financed with government stimulus money by governments around the world.\n\u2013 Present your vision as a historic shift. \u201cWhat we at I.B.M. had come to believe,\u201d Mr. Palmisano said, was that there was a \u201cseminal change in the way the world literally works.\u201d\n\u2013 It helps to have I.B.M.\u2019s marketing muscle and relationships with corporate and government decision-makers. Besides its online, print and television advertising, I.B.M. did a lot of face-to-face evangelism. \u201cWe initiated outreach in more than 50 countries, both the established and emerging nations of the world,\u201d Mr. Palmisano said. \u201cWe have held nearly 100 conferences on the subject of Smarter Cities alone, attended by more than 2,000 civic leaders.\u201d\n\u2013 Deliver enough success to support your theme. I.B.M. isn\u2019t about to talk about projects that may be falling short. Still, Mr. Palmisano pointed to winners in several fields. In cities like Stockholm, London and Singapore, the company has helped deploy congestion management systems. Mr. Palmisano pointed to the benefits: \u201cTraffic volume during peak periods has been reduced by 18 percent, CO2 emissions from motor vehicles were reduced by up to 14 percent, and public transit use increased by up to 7 percent.\u201d\n\u2013 Convert your customers to advocates. Speaking of corporate and government champions of smarter planet projects, Mr. Palmisano said, \u201cThese leaders didn\u2019t wait for legislation to be passed, or an industry consortium to be formed. They reached across multiple constituencies, took the initiative and drove change.\u201d\n\u2013 Be candid about challenges. The smarter planet systems rely on immense data collection and analysis, raising privacy and security issues. \u201cSome citizens have expressed discomfort at living in \u2026 not a safer society,\u201d Mr. Palmisano said, \u201cbut a surveillance society.\u201d (One of his speech writers, presumably, found the delightful piece from The Daily Mail in London in 2007 that pointed out the apartment in which George Orwell wrote \u201c1984\u201d now has 32 closed-circuit cameras within 200 yards.) But such challenges become brand and image-burnishing opportunities for I.B.M.

The project is co-counsel in a legal challenge to the N.Y.P.D. surveillance program. The group is on Twitter.\nUpdated July 24, 2013, 11:53 AM\nAppointing Ray Kelly to lead the Department of Homeland Security would send a troubling message to American Muslims and others who have watched him erode their rights and ignore their voices in New York City.\nHis legacy is tarnished by overaggressive policing based on prejudiced profiling. Among the biggest blights on his record: masterminding the N.Y.P.D.\u2019s program of suspicionless, discriminatory surveillance of American-Muslims.\nUnder his watch, the N.Y.P.D.\u2019s intelligence division has sent undercover officers and paid informants to spy on all things Muslim in this city and surrounding states: neighborhood cafes, student groups and places of worship. No facet of American-Muslim life has been deemed too innocent or too personal for police surveillance. Officers have infiltrated Muslim student whitewater-rafting trips, recorded mosque sermons and noted which TV channels cafes screened. Despite this expansive \u2013 and expensive \u2013 program, a N.Y.P.D. chief, Thomas Galati, has admitted during sworn testimony that during his six-year tenure at the division, this work has not yielded a single criminal lead.\nAnd the program is as harmful as it is ineffective. In a report I co-authored, \"Mapping Muslims,\" interviews with a wide swath of American-Muslims showed the devastating impact of N.Y.P.D. surveillance on their daily life. Muslim students described remaining silent during class discussions and posted signs in their clubroom urging their Muslim peers not to discuss politics. Individuals refrain from gathering to worship, not knowing whether the person praying next to them is an informant.\nKelly has alienated the very communities with whom the N.Y.P.D. should be developing a relationship of trust \u2013 to the point where our interviewees said they were too scared to ask officers for directions, or even report having had a phone stolen. Yet Kelly has taken pride in this work, and pays no heed to its consequences on those he is tasked with protecting.\nKelly\u2019s refusal to address community concern about this program is just as alarming. New Yorkers and civil liberties groups have all joined in condemning surveillance. The program is the subject of three federal lawsuits. The City Council has passed bills that would bring oversight to the N.Y.P.D. \u2014 and pointed to surveillance as among the main policies requiring intervention, along with stop and frisk.\nPlacing Kelly at the helm of D.H.S., with his demonstrated penchant for profiling and nonresponsiveness to these concerns, would be a federal endorsement of policies that are illegal, ineffective and, most important, deeply harmful.\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Many senior officials are happy to anonymously brief reporters about the state of surveillance, but there is very little that is officially made public, and still less is debated in the national press and in Parliament.\nThis lack of accountability is seen both in the way the Big-Brother acronyms (C.M.S., Natgrid, T.C.I.S., C.C.T.N.S., etc.) have been rolled out, as well as the murky status of the intelligence agencies. No intelligence agency in India has been created under an act of Parliament with clearly established roles and limitations on powers, and hence there is no public accountability whatsoever.\nThe absence of accountability has meant that the government has since 2006 been working on the C.M.S., which will integrate with the Telephone Call Interception System that is also being rolled out. The cost: around 8 billion rupees ($132 million) \u2014 more than four times the initial estimate of 1.7 billion \u2014 and even more important, our privacy and personal liberty. Under their licensing terms, all Internet service providers and telecom providers are required to provide the government direct access to all communications passing through them. However, this currently happens in a decentralized fashion, and the government in most cases has to ask the telecoms for metadata, like call detail records, visited Web sites, IP address assignments, or to carry out the interception and provide the recordings to the government. Apart from this, the government uses equipment to gain access to vast quantities of raw data traversing the Internet across multiple cities, including the data going through the undersea cables that land in Mumbai.\nWith the C.M.S., the government will get centralized access to all communications metadata and content traversing through all telecom networks in India. This means that the government can listen to all your calls, track a mobile phone and its user\u2019s location, read all your text messages, personal e-mails and chat conversations. It can also see all your Google searches, Web site visits, usernames and passwords if your communications aren\u2019t encrypted.\nYou might ask: Why is this a problem when the government already had the same access, albeit in a decentralized fashion? To answer that question, one has to first examine the law.\nThere are no laws that allow for mass surveillance in India. The two laws covering interception are the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Information Technology Act of 2000, as amended in 2008, and they restrict lawful interception to time-limited and targeted interception.The targeted interception both these laws allow ordinarily requires case-by-case authorization by either the home secretary or the secretary of the department of information technology.\nInterestingly, the colonial government framed better privacy safeguards into communications interception than did the post-independence democratic Indian state. The Telegraph Act mandates that interception of communications can only be done on account of a public emergency or for public safety. If either of those two preconditions is satisfied, then the government may cite any of the following five reasons: \u201cthe sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order, or for preventing incitement to the commission of an offense.\u201d In 2008, the Information Technology Act copied much of the interception provision of the Telegraph Act but removed the preconditions of public emergency or public safety, and expands the power of the government to order interception for \u201cinvestigation of any offense.\u201d The IT Act thus very substantially lowers the bar for wiretapping.\nApart from these two provisions, which apply to interception, there are many laws that cover recorded metadata, all of which have far lower standards. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure, no court order is required unless the entity is seen to be a \u201cpostal or telegraph authority\u201d \u2014 and generally e-mail providers and social networking sites are not seen as such.\nUnauthorized access to communications data is not punishable per se, which is why a private detective who gained access to the cellphone records of Arun Jaitley, a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, has been charged under the weak provision on fraud, rather than invasion of privacy. While there is a provision in the Telegraph Act to punish unlawful interception, it carries a far lesser penalty (up to three years of imprisonment) than for a citizen\u2019s failure to assist an agency that wishes to intercept or monitor or decrypt (up to seven years of imprisonment).\nTo put the ridiculousness of the penalty in Sections 69 and 69B of the IT Act provision in perspective, an Intelligence Bureau officer who spills national secrets may be imprisoned up to three years. And under the Indian Penal Code, failing to provide a document one is legally bound to provide to a public servant, the punishment can be up to one month\u2019s imprisonment. Further, a citizen who refuses to assist an authority in decryption, as one is required to under Section 69, may simply be exercising her constitutional right against self-incrimination. For these reasons and more, these provisions of the IT Act are arguably unconstitutional.\nAs bad as the IT Act is, legally the government has done far worse. In the licenses that the Department of Telecommunications grants Internet service providers, cellular providers and telecoms, there are provisions that require them to provide direct access to all communications data and content even without a warrant, which is not permitted by the existing laws on interception. The licenses also force cellular providers to have \u2018bulk encryption\u2019 of less than 40 bits. (Since G.S.M. network encryption systems like A5/1, A5/2, and A5/3 have a fixed encryption bit length of 64 bits, providers in India have been known use A5/0, that is, no encryption, thus meaning any person \u2014 not just the government \u2014 can use off-the-air interception techniques to listen to your calls.)\nCybercafes (but not public phone operators) are required to maintain detailed records of clients\u2019 identity proofs, photographs and the Web sites they have visited, for a minimum period of one year. Under the rules designed as India\u2019s data protection law (oh, the irony!), sensitive personal data has to be shared with government agencies, if required for \u201cpurpose of verification of identity, or for prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, prosecution, and punishment of offenses.\u201d\nAlong similar lines, in the rules meant to say when an Internet intermediary may be held liable for a user\u2019s actions, there is a provision requiring the Internet company to \u201cprovide information or any such assistance to government agencies legally authorized for investigative, protective, cybersecurity activity.\u201d (Incoherent, vague and grammatically incorrect sentences are a consistent feature of laws drafted by the Ministry of Communications and IT; one of the telecom licenses states: \u201cThe licensee should make arrangement for monitoring simultaneous calls by government security agencies,\u201d when clearly they meant \u201cfor simultaneous monitoring of calls.\u201d)\nIn a landmark 1996 judgment, the Indian Supreme Court held that telephone tapping is a serious invasion of an individual\u2019s privacy and that the citizens\u2019 right to privacy has to be protected from abuse by the authorities. Given this, undoubtedly governments must have explicit permission from their legislatures to engage in any kind of broadening of electronic surveillance powers. Yet, without introducing any new laws, the government has surreptitiously granted itself powers \u2014 powers that Parliament hasn\u2019t authorized it to exercise \u2014 by sneaking such powers into provisions in contracts and in subordinate legislation.\nPranesh Prakash is Policy Director, The Centre for Internet and Society, Bangalore.\nThursday: Why Indians shouldn\u2019t trust the government when it comes to privacy.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

[12:39 p.m. | Insert | Here\u2019s Justin Gillis\u2019s news report on the new climate findings.] [ March 29, 7:16 a.m. | Updated The final report is out and Roger Pielke, Jr., has a helpful post on the vital fine print.]\nTo my eye the summary accurately reflects the body of science aiming to find a signal of greenhouse-gas influence on climate extremes and disaster frequency and severity (the full report is still being finalized).\nSome influences are fairly robust, the panel says, particularly a warming of extreme daily maximum (and minimum) temperatures. But the report finds only \u201cmedium confidence\u201d\n(a 50/50 chance)* in a link between human activities and intensification of extreme rainfall on a global scale. (A big issue, of course, is the lack of long-term data outside developed countries.) And the odds go down from there\non attributing other recent shifts in weather-related disasters to global warming.\n[10:04 a.m. | Insert | The summary contains a sobering message for those eager to point to current patterns of extreme weather as the manifestation of greenhouse-driven warming:\nProjected changes in climate extremes under different emissions scenarios generally do not strongly diverge in the coming two to three decades, but these signals are relatively small compared to natural climate variability over this time frame. Even the sign of projected changes in some climate extremes over this time frame is uncertain.]\nThe core passage on tropical cyclones illustrates the challenge in discerning cause and effect when dealing with rare events:\nThe uncertainties in the historical tropical cyclone records, the incomplete understanding of the physical mechanisms linking tropical cyclone metrics to climate change, and the degree of tropical cyclone variability provide only low confidence for the attribution of any detectable changes in tropical cyclone activity to anthropogenic influences.\nWhile the summary warns of enormously increasing risks from drought and flooding in decades to come, it is bound to disappoint climate campaigners \u2014 and it frustrated at least one, Joe Romm, even before it was released. The section on disaster losses correctly reflects the uncertainty injected in such analysis by confounding factors, including rapidly shifting human populations and the paucity of solid data over long periods.\nThe report summary notes how wealth and development powerfully shield countries from human losses in disasters while amplifying the financial costs of such events. The section on managing risks is particularly valuable, describing strategies that have a host of benefits no matter which scenario for emissions and climate change plays out. Here\u2019s one important point:\nMany measures, when implemented effectively, make sense under a range of future climates (medium evidence, high agreement). These \u201clow regrets\u201d measures include systems that warn people of impending disasters; changes in land use planning; sustainable land management; ecosystem management; improvements in health surveillance, water supplies, and drainage systems; development and enforcement of building codes; and better education and awareness.\nThe summary for policymakers is posted online and the full report is scheduled to be released in February.\nHere\u2019s a presentation that was given today at the Kampala meeting:\nAnd here are the prime points in the section projecting impacts on societies from greenhouse heating in coming decades:\n\u2014It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase in the 21st century over many regions.\n\u2014It is virtually certain that increases in the frequency of warm daily temperature extremes and decreases in cold extremes will occur throughout the 21st century on a global scale. It is very likely\u2014 90 percent to 100 percent probability\u2014that heat waves will increase in length, frequency and/or intensity over most land areas.\n\u2014It is likely that the average maximum wind speed of tropical cyclones (also known as typhoons or hurricanes) will increase throughout the coming century, although possibly not in every ocean basin. However it is also likely\u2014in other words there is a 66 percent to 100 percent probability \u2014 that overall there will be either a decrease or essentially no change in the number of tropical cyclones.\n\u2014There is evidence, providing a basis for medium confidence, that droughts will intensify over the coming century in southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, central Europe, central North America, Central America and Mexico, northeast Brazil, and southern Africa. Confidence is limited because of definitional issues regarding how to classify and measure a drought, a lack of observational data and the inability of models to include all the factors that influence droughts.\n\u2014It is very likely that average sea level rise will contribute to upward trends in extreme sea levels in extreme coastal high water levels.\n\u2014Projected precipitation and temperature changes imply changes in floods, although overall there is low confidence at the global scale regarding climate-driven changes in magnitude or frequency of river-related flooding, due to limited evidence and because the causes of regional changes are complex.\nThere\u2019s much more on Dot Earth on extreme weather in a warming world.\n| Postscript |\nPlease read a short but valuable interview on adaptation strategies with two report authors from the Stockholm Environment Institute, Richard J.T. Klein and Lisa Schipper (whose father had been featured here a few times).\nSabrina McCormick, a sociologist and filmmaker focused on environment and health and a lead author of the climate report, has written an engaging description of the authors\u2019 work and her feelings about the findings in a guest post on Sheril Kirshenbaum\u2019s Culture of Science blog. There\u2019s more from McCormick on The Daily Climate. I think her pieces would have benefitted from a line expressly clarifying for readers that the posts are her personal interpretation of the panel\u2019s findings and not written in her capacity as an author.\nBut there\u2019s plenty of wiggle room on that, and every scientist engaged in public outreach has to choose his or her own path.\nJoe Romm posted a fresh take on the extremes summary that was slightly less critical of the climate panel. Judith Curry has explored the summary on her Climate Etc. blog. Bryan Walsh of Time Magazine has written a good survey of the findings, including the voices of some authors, including McCormick.\nIn his article for Nature, Quirin Schiermeier included an important point about the delay between issuing the summary and the underlying report \u2014 made by Stefan Rahmstorf, a German climate researcher:\n\u201cGovernments have in the past considerably weakened the language of IPCC summaries for policymakers,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as the full report is not available it is hard to say if, and to what extent, this may have happened again.\u201d\nRoger Pielke, Jr., credited the report authors for avoiding injections of spin \u2014 with one seeming exception:\nThere was one interesting change related to the statement on the state of attribution with respect to normalized disaster losses. The draft said:\nLong-term trends in normalized economic disaster losses cannot be reliably attributed to natural or anthropogenic climate change, particularly for cyclones and floods (medium evidence, high agreement).\nThe final version took out the emphasis on cyclones and floods and put in a content free clause \u2014 a good example of how the IPCC process can reduce information content:\nLong-term trends in economic disaster losses adjusted for wealth and population increases have not been attributed to climate change, but a role for climate change has not been excluded (medium evidence, high agreement).\nIt is of course true that a role for climate change has not been excluded in attribution studies \u2014 of course, the IPCC also did not exclude a role for solar influences, cosmic rays or for that matter, evil leprechauns. What the draft said with respect to floods and cyclones remains the case, hiding it from view doesn\u2019t make it go away. What silliness.\nNov. 19, 5:58 p.m. |Correction\n* Michael Oppenheimer, an IPCC author, wrote to note that I incorrectly described the level of confidence in a finding above as 50/50. That was the old panel definition of \u201cmedium confidence,\u201d but the group has changed its policies. As Oppenheimer explained: \u201cConfidence is no longer expressed quantitatively (as distinct from likelihood) but is a qualitative judgment reflecting various characteristics of the evidence and the degree of agreement between different types of evidence.\u201d", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

India is preoccupied with domestic political developments and the economy. On the foreign policy front, there is perhaps greater interest in the meeting Mr. Singh is scheduled to have with Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan in New York. Washington is focused on a potential government shutdown, and Iran and Syria are the top issues on the foreign policy docket.\nThe United States and Indian governments are keeping expectations low for the Obama-Singh meeting. Thus it is easy to lose sight of what the visit does signify \u2014 the end of an era during which administrations of different stripes in both countries laid the foundation of a strong bilateral relationship. The question that lies ahead is whether the two countries \u2014 and not just the governments \u2014 will build something substantial upon it.\nThe state of the two countries is different today than it was four years ago when Mr. Singh last visited Washington. Then, the Indian economy was growing at about 8 percent and Mr. Singh\u2019s coalition had recently returned to power. It was the United States that was struggling with the financial crisis and geopolitically. Mr. Singh\u2019s current visit comes after announcement that the Indian economy grew at a 4.4 percent rate in the last quarter and at a time when people are questioning whether his government will have a mandate to do anything substantial before the 2014 elections.\nDespite the impending politico-economic crisis in Washington, the American economy seems better off today than four years ago.\nIn combination with the unconventional energy revolution, this has observers and policymakers cautioning against betting against the United States.\nRecently, there has been much talk about the drift and the differences between India and the United States. There is little doubt that there are differences \u2014 most of which will be on the agenda when the two leaders meet.\nOn the geopolitical side, there has been much concern in India about what the United States\u2019 drawdown of forces from Afghanistan will mean for India\u2019s role there, the American and Indian relationships with Pakistan, and the American stance on terrorism. In the United States, Indian imports of oil from Iran have been a concern, especially on Capitol Hill. On the economic side, there has been heartburn in the corporate sector.\nOver the last decade, corporations had been among the strongest proponents of the United States-India relationship, but more recently it has been the complaints from this sector that have been louder. Some Indian companies are concerned that potential American immigration reform will adversely affect their business model. Sections of American business and labor have expressed chagrin about Indian trade and investment policies \u2014 their unhappiness has been evident in letters to and from congressional members, at hearings on the Hill, and in advertisements being placed in advance of the prime minister\u2019s visit. Multilaterally, the two countries disagree on climate change, global trade negotiations and issues like Syria.\nThe agenda, however, won\u2019t just be full of lamentations. The two countries have a host of regional issues to discuss, including those related to the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East. Both sides are playing down the possibility of potential agreements, but there has been an effort to get deals done on the defense and climate change fronts.\nAshton Carter, the American deputy secretary of defense, just returned from India having offered that country the opportunity to produce the Javelin missile jointly. There were some indications that there might be an agreement on climate change akin to the one China and the United States reached, but an Indian official noted that that was still a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\nThere are signs of some movement on a deal between Westinghouse and NPCIL \u2014 which would represent symbolic, even if not highly substantive, progress in the nuclear energy realm. Also on the energy front, the two countries continue to cooperate on clean energy technology, as well as potential American exports of liquefied natural gas to India.\nThe visit is also a good moment to take stock of the relationship. It is a far cry from the late 1990s. American administration officials routinely talk of the bet they have placed on India, and India is led by a man who put his government\u2019s survival on the line for a bilateral deal with the United States.\nThe India-United States relationship is broader and deeper than ever before. Cooperation ranges from India buying C-130s from America to the United States Centers for Disease Control helping their Indian counterpart establish an Epidemic Intelligence Service. Bilateral trade and investment have increased; significantly, this has been a two-way street.\nBilateral defense trade has gone from zero to $10 billion dollars and India is likely to purchase more military equipment from the United States. In 2017, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to India are scheduled to begin. Over the last year, dozens of senior American and Indian policy makers from both the central and state levels have exchanged visits. There are indeed so many dialogues, working groups, and business and government delegations, that policy makers seem to lose track of the exact number.\nIt has taken a decade and a half to lay this foundation. The question is: what will the new phase of the United States-India construction project require? Some have called for the two countries to look for another \u201c big idea.\u201d Such initiatives can spark optimism and focus the attention of the bureaucracies and the press.\nHowever, a big idea unfulfilled can lead to disillusionment as with the two countries\u2019 civil nuclear deal. Some are waiting for the elections and the formation of a new government in India, but there is no certainty what that government will do. In fact, some of the obstacles in bilateral relations today, especially on the energy and economic fronts, have been placed by India\u2019s opposition parties, which are trying to replace Mr. Singh\u2019s governing coalition in 2014.\nOne can list a number of specific initiatives for a new phase of the nations\u2019 relationship. A key prerequisite, however, will be to recognize that the partners in this project will differ. Differences don\u2019t have to be deal-breakers. As others have pointed out, the key is to learn how to manage the differences.\nIndia and the United States are clearly learning by doing and are better at dealing with disagreements. The two countries worked together to ensure that their differences over Iran did not spiral out of control. The executive branches have also become more cautious about publicly debating differences on issues such as Afghanistan, Iran and surveillance by the National Security Agency \u2014 even when there has been domestic pressure to criticize the other side openly. These skills will continue to be necessary, for example, as the two countries head to global trade talks in Bali later this year.\nThere will continue to be other complications. The very element that facilitates the United States-India relationship \u2014 democracy \u2014 will continue to complicate it. The democracy factor is often cited as driver of good relations. But it also means that debates and differences will play out publicly; that negotiations will take place under the gaze of a free press; and that domestic politics will have to be navigated and negotiated. American policy makers only need to look to their experiences with France and Israel for lessons learned. And Indian policy makers will have to show the same patience with the domestic political constraints their American counterparts face that they demand.\nComplications will also arise because the quantitative and qualitative change in the relationship means that it involves more issues, interactions and stakeholders than ever before \u2014 making greater friction natural. It also involves engagement on issues that span the foreign-domestic divide, including in the economic, energy and immigration realms. These issues require policymakers to tread carefully, given that both countries are sensitive to outsiders trying to influence domestic politics.\nThere are also legacy issues that will continue to complicate the relationship. While the United States might be popular in India with the public and coalitions led by both parties have worked toward closer bilateral relations, opposition parties still use the term \u201cpro-U.S.\u201d to attack governments. Indian governments continue to feel vulnerable to such attack.\nThe construction of a substantial partnership between the two nations won\u2019t be easy; there will probably be delays and cost overruns. The two governments have, nonetheless, decided that it is worth building. But the project will need attention and resources at a time when both sides have other, arguably more pressing, preoccupations. It will also require heavy-lifting from the private sector and public, constituencies who benefit from the relationship to be vocal, and the two sides not to shy away from talking transactions.\nTanvi Madan is a fellow in the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, and director of its India Project.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

In essence everyone will suffer the fate of professional chess players, who always know when they have lost a game, have an exact numerical rating for their overall performance, and find excuses for failure hard to come by.\nIndividuals will have many measures of their proficiency. They will have an incentive to disclose that information to get the better job or social opportunity. You\u2019ll assume the worst about those who keep secrets, and so openness will reign. Many of us will start to hate the idea of Big Data.\nPEOPLE UNLUCKY IN HEALTH CARE Quality surgery and cancer treatment cannot be automated very easily. They will be highly expensive, and unlucky health breaks will be all the more tragic because not everyone will be able to afford the best treatments.\nWith marvelous diagnosis available online, some people will get the right treatments early on, whereas others will know exactly what they are dying from.\nPEOPLE WHO DON\u2019T NEED MONEY We are used to thinking in terms of rich, poor and middle class, but those categories will change. Berlin\u2019s eastern neighborhoods and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are a window onto our future. These urban areas are full of people who are bright, culturally literate, Internet-savvy and far from committed to the idea of hard work directed toward earning a good middle-class living. We\u2019ll need a new name for the group of people who have the incomes of the lower middle class and the cultural habits of the wealthy or upper middle class. They will spread a libertarian worldview that working for other people full time is an abominable way to get by.\nPOLITICAL RADICALS: A mechanized, computer-driven, highly unequal future is sometimes viewed as a recipe for rebellion. But the Edward J. Snowden saga shows this won\u2019t be easy, as tech is at least as much an instrument for surveillance and control as it is for revolt. We\u2019re also aging rapidly, and that tends to make society more peaceful, less violent and less extreme in all directions. It was the 1960s, a peak era for manufacturing jobs and the American middle class, that brought so much social turmoil and unrest. The more that work is done by machines, the less compelling is the case for putting your manufacturing in a distant country where wages are low. If there is any big winner from all of these trends, it is probably the good ol\u2019 United States.\nTyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAverage is Over,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

On Friday, Politico\u2019s Alexander Burns ran down some polling numbers that help explain why the more hawkish perspective is no longer an obvious political winner, even in a G.O.P. primary:\n\u2026 there are also more than a few daunting data points for the anti-Paul coalition within the GOP \u2013 signs in public opinion research that the country has moved substantially from the Bush-era national security consensus.\nA Washington Post poll this week showed 67 percent of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan is not worth fighting, including a bare majority of Republicans. An extensive Pew survey published Friday found a mixed public attitude on surveillance: half of Americans said they approve of the government\u2019s information-collecting, but 56 percent said courts weren\u2019t providing adequate oversight and a 47-percent plurality said the government had done too much to limit civil liberties. And public polls consistently show public hesitation about possible U.S. intervention in Syria \u2026\nAs Matt Yglesias pointed on Twitter, those Pew numbers on civil liberties included a striking turnaround since 2010 (not 2008, as one would expect if it were all just a partisan swing) among Tea Partiers and conservatives, who now tilt more sharply than G.O.P. moderates in favor of the proposition that the government has traded too much liberty for security. So as odd as it is, especially for anyone who experienced the Bush era, to hear a non-interventionist Republican attacking a tough-on-terror Republican for being too \u201cliberal,\u201d given the current shape of Republican opinion Rand Paul\u2019s framing of his debate with Christie is defensible: By invoking 9/11 to defend the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance programs, the New Jersey governor was arguably attacking Paul from the left.\nWith the Bush-era categories thus scrambled, it will be extremely interesting to see how this plays out. The good news for Republicans is that the debate itself is a sign of intellectual health: After the foreign policy failures of the Bush era, the party needs a vigorous internal argument about national security \u2014 at least if it ever hopes to regain the public\u2019s trust on those issues, instead of just recycling cliches about toughness and resolve a la the Romney campaign. But the bad news is that in the short term, this argument has the potential to open a real cleavage in the right-of-center coalition. I don\u2019t think John McCain would actually endorse Hillary Clinton in 2016 because I don\u2019t think Rand Paul will actually be the G.O.P. nominee, but neither do I think McCain is just making an empty threat in this interview: A G.O.P. primary campaign carried out along the lines of his Senate feud with Paul really would have the potential to fracture the party\u2019s general-election unity.\nWith that being said, the \u201chawk vs. libertarian, McCain vs. Paul\u201d binary is also not the only way a savvy Republican politician might approach these debates. For instance, there is no necessary reason why, having taken the pro-N.S.A. position on one front, a figure like Christie would also need to support an American military intervention in Syria or a permanent U.S. presence in Afghanistan. Indeed, from a purely political, poll-reading perspective he would have every reason to cast his domestic tough guy routine as an alternative to foreign warmaking: Both the country and his party may be divided on civil liberties, but there\u2019s a clear American and Republican consensus against, say, adding Syria to the list of American kinetic military actions. Whatever you think of the position that George W. Bush was right about the war on terror but wrong about regime change, it\u2019s a potential sweet spot for a conservative politician trying to appeal to a war-weary party and country both.\nHowever, I\u2019m doubtful that Christie will ultimately take this kind of split-the-difference tack, because with the eclipse of foreign-policy realism within the G.O.P. there\u2019s a shortage of potential advisers and influencers who represent any kind of middle way between crusading interventionism and Paul-style libertarianism. And if that debate does end up splitting the party in 2016, it could be a case study in why the Eisenhower/Nixon/H.W. Bush realists were so useful to the Cold War-era G.O.P., and why the party misses them today.\nThe realists weren\u2019t particularly liked by anyone else within the conservative tent: They were too squishy for the Birchers and later too cautious for the neocons, too internationalist for the party\u2019s Jacksonian base, too pro-defense spending for the libertarians, too Arabist for pro-Israel Republicans, too willing to use force for the paleocons and Buchananites. (This is part of why Eisenhower\u2019s presidency is criminally underrated within his own party.) And there were many non-foreign policy reasons why their influence diminished over time: They were mostly social liberals and economic moderates, and as time went by and WASP Republicanism waned as a force in our politics, they increasingly lacked any electoral constituency to speak of on the right.\nBut their persistent role in Republican administrations, from Ike\u2019s two terms down to Robert Gates\u2019s tenure as Bush\u2019s defense secretary, was deeply important to the G.O.P.\u2019s longstanding advantage on foreign policy. By embodying a version of internationalism that clearly put the national interest first, and a form of Daddy-Party toughness that didn\u2019t necessarily entail starting wars willy-nilly, the realists both helped the party manage its internal tensions on foreign policy \u2014 bridging divides between isolationists and advocates of \u201crollback,\u201d paleocons and neocons \u2014 and present a credible, competent and non-scary face to the American public as a whole.\nThat\u2019s something the post-Bush party has thus far failed to do. And if any 2016 candidate wants to unite their party on foreign policy rather than just polarizing it, reaching for the realist legacy might be a decent place to start.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

To explore that pessimism a little more, allow me to pivot off an interesting recent passage from a writer named Jacob Bacharach, who\u2019s writing in defense of the Millennial generation\u2019s willingness to put it all online:\n\u2026 we now find not only kids, but adults (especially new adults) getting constantly dinged with the dire warning that Social Media Lasts Forever. I think this is probably patently untrue in a purely physical sense; it strikes me as probable that fifty years from now, the whole electronic record of our era will be largely lost in a sea of forgotten passwords, proprietary systems, faulty hardware, and compatibility issues. But it should also be untrue in, dare I say it, the moral sense. Educators and employers are constantly yelling that you young people have an affirmative responsibility not to post anything where a teacher or principal or, worst of all, boss or potential boss might find it, which gets the ethics of the situation precisely backwards. It isn\u2019t your sister\u2019s obligation to hide her diary; it\u2019s yours not to read it. Your boyfriend shouldn\u2019t have to close all his browser windows and hide his cell phone; you ought to refrain from checking his history and reading his texts. But, says the Director of Human Resources and the Career Counselor, social media is public; you\u2019re putting it out there. Yes, well, then I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t mind if I join you guys at happy hour with this flip-cam and a stenographer. Privacy isn\u2019t the responsibility of individuals to squirrel away secrets; it\u2019s the decency of individuals to leave other\u2019s lives alone.\nAt some point, employers will have to face up to the unavoidability of hiring people whose first Google image is a shirtless selfie. Demographics will demand it. They\u2019ll have to get used to it just as surely as they\u2019ll have to get used to nose rings and, god help us, neck tattoos. It\u2019s a shame, though, that it\u2019ll be compulsory and reluctant. We should no more have to censor our electronic conversations than whisper in a restaurant. I suspect that as my own generation and the one after it finally manage to boot the Boomers from their tenacious hold on the steering wheel of this civilization that they\u2019ve piloted ineluctably and inexorably toward the shoals, all the while whining about the lazy passengers, we will better understand this, and be better, and more understanding. And I hope that the kids today will refuse to heed the warnings and insist on making a world in which what is actually unacceptable is to make one\u2019s public life little more than series of polite and carefully maintained lies.\nThis is an eloquent statement of how many people, especially my age and younger, think about their online lives, and how they want others (including institutions as well as individuals) to approach what they share on social media. Certainly the moral case Bacharach makes is a potent one: An employer snooping on employees\u2019 Facebook pages, an ex-boyfriend forwarding intimate photos from past relationships to his friends, and yes, a government sifting your social media data are all engaged in something far more indecent than the online behavior they\u2019re exploiting. And the society he hopes for is one that most of today\u2019s young people will probably experience: A world where everyone treats Facebook the way they treat a happy hour with friends is a world where the individual costs of online sharing will be minimized (because everyone is doing it), and where most people\u2019s scantily-clad selfies and dumb tweets won\u2019t hurt their employment prospects, let alone attract any interest from the government.\nBut it\u2019s still the case that if your boss or your ex-boyfriend or your friendly neighborhood N.S.A. did have some reason to exploit your texts and tweets and emails and selfies, they would have means and opportunities that no previous era of social interaction has afforded. And that\u2019s what\u2019s missing from Bacharach\u2019s accounting: An acknowledgment that the use of social media is inherently different from offline forms of socializing, not in its content or intent, but in the kind of power it automatically cedes to other people and institutions, to use and exploit as they choose.\nYou can see this in the analogies he chooses, to restaurant dinners and happy hours. If you go to happy hour with your pals, those pals and maybe a nosy bartender are the only people who can exploit whatever happens there, and if somebody showed up with a flipcam and notebook you\u2019d notice the weirdness of the situation quickly enough and alter your behavior accordingly. Likewise if you go on a date to a nice restaurant; you\u2019d start censoring yourself pretty quickly if the couple at the next table started writing down everything you said.\nIf you hold forth with your pals on Gmail or Facebook, though, the flipcam-and-notebook combination is built into the platform you\u2019re using, and it belongs to your corporate hosts: You\u2019re giving them a semi-permanent record of what you\u2019ve said and done, and however unethical it might be for them to exploit it, sell it, or allow the government to access it, the power to do so nonetheless exists. Likewise on a more personal level: What\u2019s shared with friends and lovers electronically gives them more power over you than a careless word or even an intimate letter would have done. In both cases, betrayal is possible, but in the online case, it can happen faster and more comprehensively than ever before.\nAnd if there\u2019s one thing we know from human history, it\u2019s that powers granted rarely go unexploited. You may not be victimized personally; indeed, you probably won\u2019t be. But someone will, or many someones, in ways that wouldn\u2019t have been possible or even imaginable before the internet.\nThis victimization deserves to be condemned rather than just explained: A truly moral person, a truly moral corporation, and a truly moral government would not exploit the kind of information that people now share with one another on the internet. But it is not sufficient to simply say, with Bacharach and many others who have come of age with the internet, that privacy is \u201cthe decency \u2026 to leave other\u2019s lives alone,\u201d and demand that the world and all its powers live up to that ideal. Privacy is also the wisdom to recognize that not all peers and powers are actually decent, and that one\u2019s exposure should perhaps be limited accordingly. And it\u2019s precisely because the ease and convenience of internet communication inclines us all (myself included) to forget or compromise this wisdom \u2014 or else pretend to we\u2019re abandoning it out of some higher commitment to honesty and openness \u2014 that I expect us to make our peace with the surveillance state, now and for many years to come.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Bush and Dick Cheney. It was adapted from his book, \u201cDays of Fire: Bush and Cheney in the White House,\u201d to be published by Doubleday on Oct. 22.\nOne of the last times I saw Dick Cheney, he was partying at a bar in Dallas just before midnight.\nActually, he never even made it inside the bar because he was mobbed in the parking lot. He was wearing a cowboy hat, khakis and a blue blazer while nursing a drink someone had brought him, chatting with former colleagues and posing for pictures with admirers.\nCheney had come to Texas for the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum last April, and the Bush alumni were holding a pre-event celebration at the Katy Trail Ice House beer garden. More than a thousand veterans of the administration had turned up but none more interesting than the former vice president, who may be anathema in Manhattan but was a rock star in the Lone Star State.\nThis was the first time I had seen him since his heart transplant, and it clearly had made a difference. Physically, at least, he seemed like a new man, energetic yet relaxed, his face fuller than in the months before the operation when he was kept alive solely by a pump inside his chest attached to a battery hidden by a vest he always wore. He lingered so long in the bar parking lot that night that he outlasted his daughter Mary, who accompanied him before giving up and heading back to their hotel. \u201cEver since the heart transplant,\u201d she told me the next day, \u201cit\u2019s been like a miracle.\u201d\nFor whatever reason, Cheney cooperated with my history of his time with Bush in the White House, perhaps seeing it as a chance to set the record straight. He agreed to give two long background interviews at his house in McLean, Va., patiently answering every question, and later when I asked to put many of his comments on the record, he agreed to every one without quarrel or haggling.\nBush, by contrast, declined all requests to interview him, explaining that he did not think a New York Times reporter could be fair in such a project, given the paper\u2019s sharply liberal editorial page and, in his view, the bias on its news pages. He seemed amused by my repeated efforts to change his mind. \u201cBaker, you stalking me?\u201d he asked when he spotted me at an event sponsored by his public-policy institute.\nCheney remains such an intriguing figure that perhaps no amount of time interviewing him would fully penetrate the mystery. His critics call him Darth Vader, a war criminal, an evil genius, the puppet master behind the throne. But sitting with him, I was struck by how calm, unflappable and unbombastic he was as he defended a worldview that has stirred so much debate in American life.\nHis positions are firm and unyielding; he expresses no major regrets. He comes across as utterly unbothered by his dark reputation. The tradeoffs others found unsettling or even unforgivable \u2014 waterboarding, the Iraq war, surveillance, Guantanamo \u2014 he sees as necessary. In the course of protecting the country against what he deemed an existential threat, other worries seemed beside the point.\nAt one point, I asked him if any part of him felt queasy about what was done in the name of security, even if intellectually it may have been justified. \u201cNo,\u201d he said with the calm certitude that marked his tenure in public life. \u201cI firmly believe that it was the right thing to do. It worked. We haven\u2019t been hit for seven and a half years, longer than that now.\u201d\nHis evolution since leaving office has been mainly physical.

It copies the famous illustration of Eustace Tilley, a top-hatted man peering through a monocle that was on the cover of the first issue in 1925. But the church has made him look more like a hobo, with ratty clothes and flies buzzing around him.\nThe church also copies the magazine\u2019s signature font \u2014 but alters it just enough to avoid running into any legal trouble.\nMuch of the magazine\u2019s criticisms of The New Yorker article are directed at the author, Lawrence Wright. The church refers to the article\u2019s primary subject, a former Scientologist named\nPaul Haggis, who won two Academy Awards for the movie as \u201cthe hypocrite of Hollywood\u201d and a \u201cnobody\u201d whose career has peaked.\nIt is especially scornful of other former church members cited in the piece, who are pictured in the church publication in a series of unflattering photos. \u201cThe New Yorker \u2014 if you wonder why they don\u2019t use photographs, here\u2019s your answer,\u201d a headline says. (The New Yorker does, in fact, use photographs.)\nThe church mocks The New Yorker as no better than a supermarket tabloid, with a fake New Yorker cover headlined \u201cRemnick Denies Alien Baby Claim,\u201d a dig at the magazine\u2019s editor,\nDavid Remnick.\nBut not all of it is light-hearted. The church singles out editors, fact-checkers and other New Yorker staff members who worked on the article by name and prints their photos. The church also uses what appears to be a surveillance photograph taken of Mr. Wright while he was conducting an interview at an outdoor cafe in Texas.\nA New Yorker spokeswoman said the magazine had absolute confidence in its article and stood by it.\nChurch officials did not respond to messages left at their California and Florida offices on Wednesday.\nWhen asked about the publication, one of the women distributing it in front of the Cond\u00e9 Nast building on 42nd Street seemed unsure of its contents.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s supposed to be The New Yorker,\u201d the middle-aged woman said, pointing to the cover illustration. When asked whether Freedom was published by the Church of Scientology, she claimed not to know. When it was pointed out to her that she was standing outside The New Yorker\u2019s offices, she said, \u201cOh, that must be why we\u2019re here.\u201d\nSo far the church has not sued Cond\u00e9 Nast, a tack it has taken with many others who have crossed it. Time magazine was faced with a $416 million lawsuit after it ran an article titled \u201cThe Thriving Cult of Greed and Power.\u201d\nPrior to taking legal action, the church took out a series of ads in USA Today disparaging the magazine.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The video, complete with ominous soundtrack, warns instead that such visits are intended to corrupt Chinese officers.\nThe strikingly hard-line film, titled \u201cSilent Contest\u201d (\u8f83\u91cf\u65e0\u58f0), also takes aim at Western nongovernmental organizations, the American and British consulates in Hong Kong, and\nprominent reformers inside China. It accuses Washington of sponsoring exiled minority leaders such as the Dalai Lama and the Uighur dissident Rebiya Kadeer.\nIt is not clear if the video was intentionally released online or somehow leaked, but it began disappearing from Chinese websites on Thursday night. Its heavy ideological content and propaganda style suggest it may have been produced to support the work of the military\u2019s political commissars, who are charged with the ideological indoctrination of troops and maintaining their morale, discipline and loyalty. As such, the film appears to offer a remarkably straightforward glimpse into the Cold War mind-set of the Chinese military leadership, as well as the deep suspicions of the United States festering inside one of the most influential institutions in the Chinese political system.\nCutting from crude graphics of American dollar bills to standard shots of the Statue of Liberty to blurry footage of American leaders from George Washington to President Obama, the video bemoans the fall of the Soviet Union and warns that China faces a similar fate if it fails to counter Washington\u2019s nefarious efforts to infiltrate Chinese society.\nThe General Staff Department of the People\u2019s Liberation Army is listed as a producer of the film, along with the army\u2019s National Defense University and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\nThe university\u2019s president, Wang Xibin, a lieutenant general, appears on camera describing how the United States grooms \u201cfriendly forces, so-called democratic forces,\u201d inside China and on the \u201cexterior goes against the party\u2019s absolute control of the army.\u201d He also criticizes visits by American and Chinese military officials to the other\u2019s country, saying that the exchanges will increasingly be used by the United States for \u201cinfiltration.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to take careful precaution and look out for the smallest detail, and build a strong political and ideological line of defense,\u201d General Wang says.\nThe United States has long urged reluctant Chinese leaders to increase the number of military exchanges, arguing that such visits yield transparency and trust. In recent months, several top Pentagon officers have traveled to China or hosted visits by their Chinese counterparts, a flurry that Washington has described as progress.\nThe version of the film available online Thursday was undated, but it contained footage of President Xi Jinping after he took office in March. It makes no mention of Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor with the National Security Agency whose leaks in June about the scale of Washington\u2019s global surveillance presented the Chinese with a propaganda windfall.\nThe video singles out villains in both China and the United States.\nIn China, nearly a dozen people \u2014 scholars, lawyers, disgraced military personnel and dismissed journalists \u2014 are accused of having been compromised by the United States. In some cases, lines in their writings are shown and underlined for emphasis. Among those tarred are Mao Yushi, 84, a liberal economist who was awarded the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty at a ceremony in Washington last year, and He Weifang, a prominent law professor at Peking University and an advocate for judicial reform.\nOn the American side, the video goes after nongovernmental organizations, including the Carter Center, the Asia Foundation, the International Republican Institute and the Ford Foundation. \u201cNongovernmental organizations are the soft tentacles of Western countries displaying the will of their nation,\u201d the narrator intones. The Fulbright program, which has promoted cultural exchanges between the United States and other countries since the late 1940s, is called an instrument for \u201cAmerica\u2019s cultural invasion.\u201d\nThe video takes exception to local officials who visited the United States in 2004 to look at the election process as guests of the Carter Center, complaining that the participants were part of \u201ca very meticulous plan\u201d for what the Americans wanted to achieve in China. Sounding alarmed, the narrator points out that one official returned from the visit and wrote a blog post arguing that elections were the legitimate way for a government to gain power in a country.\nThe film depicts the United States and British consulates in Hong Kong as nests of spies, without actually using the word. \u201cA lot of information suggests that the functions of the two consulates extend to more than what is described on paper,\u201d the narrator says, noting that the consulates together employ more than 900 staff members and accusing them of supporting \u201csubversive\u201d pro-democracy movements in Hong Kong.\nA spokesman for the American Embassy in Beijing had no comment on the film.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

The Chinese Embassy in Manila issued a statement reaffirming its claim to sovereignty over the islands and said that the Philippine Navy was harassing its fishing vessels in the area.\nThe standoff comes at a time of increasing assertiveness by China in its claims to the South China Sea waters around the Philippines. The dispute intensified after the Philippines announced in February that it would invite foreign energy companies to explore for oil and gas in the waters west of Palawan Province, and adjacent to the Spratly Islands.\nThe Philippines, an ally of the United States, has become a particular target of China's anger in the South China Sea disputes. Some analysts speculate that Beijing's harsher tone could be a tit-for-tat after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stood on the deck of an American warship last November in Manila Bay and reaffirmed the military alliance between the Philippines and the United States.\nMrs. Clinton referred to an area of the South China Sea as the West Philippine Sea -- a name used by the Philippines but not other nations -- a point that irritated the Chinese.\nIn a demonstration of how exploration of oil and gas is a crucial aspect of the South China Sea territorial disputes, American and Philippine naval exercises this month will include one that involves retaking a hijacked oil rig, according to the Philippine military. The current naval standoff began Sunday when Philippine surveillance aircraft spotted eight Chinese fishing boats near Scarborough Shoal, an outcropping of rocks 124 nautical miles east of Luzon Island in the Philippines. The shoal, which is called Panatag in the Philippines and Huangyan in China, is claimed by both countries.\nThe Philippine Navy sent the Gregorio del Pilar, a 378-foot patrol frigate that was formerly an American Coast Guard cutter. The ship arrived early Tuesday and found the boats anchored inside the horseshoe-shaped shoal, according to Vice Adm. Alexander P. Pama.\n''At about 7:20 in the morning, the boarding team started to conduct a board, search and seizure on the first Chinese fishing vessel and found large amounts of corals, sizable quantities of giant clams and live sharks in its compartments,'' Admiral Pama told reporters on Wednesday, adding that the other Chinese boats carried similar sea resources that he said were illegal to harvest.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, two Chinese surveillance ships, identified by Philippine officials as Zhonggou Haijian 75 and Zhonggou Haijian 84, took positions at the mouth of the lagoon within the shoal, blocking the Philippine Navy vessel's access to the fishing boats inside.\nOne of the Chinese ships radioed the Philippine ship and said that the area was Chinese territory and that the Philippine Navy should withdraw. The Philippine captain responded that the shoal was his country's territory. As of late Wednesday, the vessels remained in position.\nIn its statement, the Chinese Embassy said the fishing boats were in the lagoon seeking shelter from a storm when ''a Philippine Naval gunboat blocked the entrance of the lagoon, and sent 12 Philippine soldiers, 6 of which armed, into the lagoon and harassed the Chinese fishermen.''\nIt went on to say that the embassy had contacted the Philippine government and ''reiterated China's sovereignty over Huangyan Island, urged the Philippine side to stop immediately their illegal activities and leave this area.''\nScarborough Shoal, which sits amid rich fishing grounds, has been a point of contention for more than a decade between China and the Philippines. Fishermen from both countries have had previous confrontations with opposing naval vessels.\nThe Philippines claims the area as part of its 200-mile exclusive economic zone, while China says that the area was mapped as Chinese territory as early as the 13th century. The shoal lies north of the Spratly Islands, which are also claimed by China, the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations.\nIn Beijing last week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated that China had ''indisputable sovereignty'' over the Spratly Islands and their adjacent waters, and ''resolutely'' opposed actions by other countries that ''damage China's sovereignty.''\nIn an article published online this week, a Chinese Army officer accused the Philippines of trying to use American power to intimidate China. The officer, Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, warned that China might reconsider its planned $50 billion investments in the Philippines.\nLast week, at a summit meeting of Southeast Asian leaders, China strongly opposed an effort by the Philippines and Vietnam to draft a regional code of conduct to resolve the territorial disagreements.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}

Snowden insisted that a group of lawyers advising him in the Chinese territory \u201chide their cellphones in the refrigerator of the home where he was staying, to block any eavesdropping,\u201d as my colleague Keith Bradsher reported.\nWhy a refrigerator? The answer does not, as some might assume, have anything to do with temperature. In fact, it does not matter particularly if the refrigerator was plugged in. It is the materials that make up refrigerator walls that could potentially turn them into anti-eavesdropping devices.\n\u201cWhat you want to do is block the radio signals which could be used to transmit voice data, and block the audio altogether,\u201d Adam Harvey, a designer specializing in countersurveillance products explained. Refrigerators made from metal with thick insulation could potentially do both, he says, regardless of whether it is mild or icy within.\nOn the data-transmission front, thick metal walls can create a sort of electromagnetic barrier, which enables the device to function as something known as a Faraday cage. A true Faraday cage is a space where radio waves cannot pass and therefore data cannot be transmitted. Although not all fridges function this way, those constructed with more metal have the potential to serve this purpose.\nAnother household object that functions similarly, Mr. Harvey has learned through his research into cellphone data transmission, is a stainless steel martini shaker.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect Faraday cage \u2013 it will block all radio signals unless you decide you need to pour yourself a martini,\u201d he said. Although this sounds like a plot point in a James Bond movie, Mr. Harvey has actually done extensive tests on the shaker in the process of developing a surveillance-blocking cellphone case called the OFF Pocket.\nBlocking data transmission, of course, is a different issue from muffling audio. Although a thick refrigerator door is good at masking sound (as anyone who has lost a cat inside one knows), soundproofing is not necessarily integral to its design. An ideal refrigerator for a person on the run would be one that functioned as an acoustic anechoic chamber \u2014 a sort of Faraday cage for sound \u2014 meaning that not one hint of a syllable could make it from the Pepsi-laden kitchen table to the phone in the veggie crisper. Given that refrigerators\u2019 insulation levels vary, however, from an audio perspective, burying the phone in a pile of clothes one room over, Mr. Harvey suggested, might be a more reliable solution for someone seeking to subvert prying ears.\nThose new to these issues are most likely asking the question \u2013 why not just ask everyone to turn off his phone and remove the batteries? Beyond the fact that many phones these days do not easily enable battery removal, identifying a pure off is complicated.\n\u201cA lot of modern devices (not just phones) do have states that are somewhere in between fully on and fully off, where some circuits\nare powered up and others are powered down,\u201d Seth Schoen, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties group that focuses on rights in the online world, explained by e-mail. (Snowden appears to be a supporter of the organization, as he was photographed with an E.F.F. sticker on his laptop.) \u201cThese modes often allow the device to wake up autonomously if certain conditions are met, such as pressing a certain key or even receiving certain data over the Internet on a wired Ethernet connection (known as \u2018wake-on-LAN\u2019).\u201d\nBattery removal can be equally deceptive. Even once one figures out how to extract the primary battery, there may be additional power sources within the apparatus. \u201cSome phones use an additional battery for memory management; it\u2019s unclear whether this battery could be used by logging and/or tracking systems such as Carrier IQ,\u201d Mr. Harvey explained, referring to software that monitors mobile phone users.", "is_homepage": false, "is_shortened": false, "version": "0.9.4"}
